1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Well, first of all, I just have to do a shout out for my husband,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 who's unfortunately not very well.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 So, usually he's sat on the front row.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 He's not here, so, love you.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 (Laughter)

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Hello, everyone, and welcome watching online.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 So glad that we can pack everybody in.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 It's so good.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Well, you know, Christine Gardner works here.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 She leads our Psychotherapist and Counseling Center Oasis.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 And she did a staff training for us a number of months ago,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 and it was on self-care.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And one of the things that she said to us was,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 "You will have pain."

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Not quite what we were expecting for self-care,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 but she's right.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Her point was that life is full of pain.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We cannot get away from it.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 When we understand that there will be pain and we accept it,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 we may not like it, we certainly don't have to want it.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 However, when we understand it will be with us,

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 then our relationship with pain changes.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 It then allows us, rather than to suppress and try and push away pain,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 it allows us to then think about how we can invite God

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 into the pain that we are experiencing.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 In the same way, life is messy.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You cannot have a mess-free life.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I'm sorry.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 It just is the way it is.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And so we have to accept that there will be mess.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 But we learn that God is not unfamiliar or surprised by mess either.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 In fact, today we're going to look at how God can be actually found in our mess.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 In our second week of Advent,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 we look at the messy priest story of the birth of Jesus.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 We look at two characters in the narrative captured in the Gospel of Luke

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 who find themselves in deeply messy situations

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 and yet find ways to trust God despite the far from ideal circumstances.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 We'll look at how their stories relate to us,

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 how they teach us that we too can find God in the messiness of our own lives,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 embrace that mess, and position ourselves for a hopeful future.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So of the four Gospels,

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 only Luke begins with the story of the birth of John the Baptist.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And he introduces us to his father, Zechariah.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Now Luke tells us some interesting facts about Zechariah

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 to help us characterize the type of man that he was.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 First of all, his profession.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 He was very honorable.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 He was a priest, and he belonged to the priestly division of Abijah.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 His wife, called Elizabeth, was also of priestly descent,

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 and they were both described as upright in the sight of God.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 We also learn that they were childless.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Scripture tells us that Elizabeth was barren,

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 and we knew culturally at that time there was a lot of shame and public disgrace

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 around not being able to have children.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And then finally we're told that they were old.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Well, actually, Scripture says that they were well along in years,

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 which I think is a much better way of saying they were old, right?

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 So next Luke leads us into the story by setting the scene in the temple.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 The priests bore the responsibility of serving in the temple,

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 offering the sacrifice required by Mosaic law,

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 acting as the mediators between the people and God.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And on this occasion we are told Zechariah had been chosen by Lot

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 to enter into the holy place.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 He's there to burn incense.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And the offering of incense represented the prayers of intercession

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 for all of the people, so it was considered a very sacred task,

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 and for Zechariah an opportunity of a lifetime.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 So while Zechariah was in the holy place, an angel appeared to him.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Now, understandably, Zechariah was afraid.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I think I would be too.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Even though, as a priest, he would have a sense of awe and trepidation

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 when he's serving, so that would be natural,

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 but this was a fear much, much more.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 He was probably not expecting to encounter an angel on that day.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 But the angel goes on to declare a very positive and personal message to Zechariah,

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 telling him that Elizabeth and his prayers to have a child were about to be answered.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 So let's pick up the story in Luke 1, verses 13 to 17.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 When the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 "Your prayer has been heard.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 "Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 "You are to call him John.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 "He will be a joy and delight to you.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 "Many will rejoice because of his birth.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 "He will be great in the sight of the Lord.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 "He is never to take wine or other fermented drink,

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 "and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 "He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 "He will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 "to turn the hearts of the parents to their children

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 "and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteousness,

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 "to make readier people prepared for the Lord."

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Wow, what a message.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 You can almost feel the excitement in the angel's declaration

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 that will ultimately prepare the way for the long-awaited Messiah.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 But unfortunately, Zechariah's response was not one of joy,

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 but rather disbelief.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So let's just take a moment to consider this.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 So here is Zechariah. He's a Jewish priest.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 We are told he is a good, upright man.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 He's standing in the holiest, holy place,

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 and he's carrying out the role of offering the prayers on behalf of the people,

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 including his own very personal prayer, and he's facing an angel.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Now, Zechariah knew the Torah,

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 so he would have been very familiar with the story

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 of how a heavenly visitation to another elderly couple

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 many years before, Abraham and Sarah,

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 who also received a message that they would bear a son

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 who would play an important role in the story of God redeeming a fallen world.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Despite all of this, Zechariah lacked faith, and he doubted God.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 So we have to ask the question, why?

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Had he become hardened over the years of praying for something

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 and waiting and waiting for that prayer to be answered?

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Can we relate to that?

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Was he over-familiar with the routine of priestly duties?

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I wonder maybe sometimes we can become hardened to God

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 as our prayers appear to go unanswered.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Of course, we don't stop praying,

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 but do we allow a little bit of disbelief,

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 hinder us from truly seeing God,

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 so when he does answer, we possibly miss it?

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 I think for some of us here that have been Christians for a long time,

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 we can find ourselves appearing to trust God on the outside,

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 carrying all the good duties of a good Christian,

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 saying all the right things,

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 and yet if we were really honest,

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 we've allowed the years of unanswered prayers,

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 and with that, a disappointment in God to take root.

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And if an angel were to visit us today, how would we respond?

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Well, Zechariah's response was, "How can I be sure of this?

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I'm an old man. My wife is long in years."

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Judging by the reply,

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 I don't think the angel was particularly happy about that response.

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 The angel said to him, "I am Gabriel.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I stand in the presence of God,

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news,

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 and now you will be silent and not able to speak

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 until the day this happens,

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 because you did not believe my words,

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 which will come true at their appointed time."

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Ouch.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 The angel is making a point.

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 While Scripture records numerous visitations of angelic beings,

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 there's only a couple of recorded references to their actual names,

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 and here, the Hebrew name for Gabriel means "God is my strength."

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 The angel is leaving no doubt in Zechariah's mind

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 that he's been sent directly by God,

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 reminding Zechariah of the power of God

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 and his promises that will be fulfilled.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And the consequences of Zechariah's disbelief?

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 He's struck dumb.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 He's physically silenced.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 As Zechariah eventually leaves the holy place,

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 all the expectant people and worshippers outside,

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 no doubt wondering what on earth happened,

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 they're met with silence from Zechariah.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 The greatest chance for Zechariah to do the job well,

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 and he messes up.

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And I imagine he went home with disappointment in himself,

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 silenced not just by the angel, but with a deep sense of shame.

160
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 So let's talk about shame.

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I think we underestimate the power of shame over our lives

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 and how it easily can hold us captive.

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 According to Brené Brown,

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 a respected professor, author, and researcher

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 for 20 years on vulnerability and shame,

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 she says, "Shame is the painful feeling or experience

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 "of believing that we are flawed,

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 "therefore unworthy of love and belonging.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 "It's the competing, conflicting expectation

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 "of who we are supposed to be

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 "and the huge weight of expectation we put on ourselves

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 "or are put on us by others."

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Shame tells us that we are not good enough

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 and we will never be good enough.

175
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Brown connects the destructive nature of shame

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 to addiction, depression, aggression, bullying, suicide,

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 self-harm, eating disorders, to name a few.

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And the problem with shame is that it is often hidden.

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 We don't talk about it.

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 We keep it hidden and then we carry this weight

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 of self-judgment and then because of that,

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 we get stuck in this cycle of negative behavior

183
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 that then leads us to more shame and guilt.

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And as Christians, we are not immune to shame.

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And I wonder if especially in church communities,

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 the secret, silent, judgmental hold of shame

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 keeps us from being truly open and honest with each other.

188
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Are we safe communities that allow people to be vulnerable,

189
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 to share their stories without fear of judgment?

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Well, scripture tells us very clearly,

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 "Therefore there is now no condemnation

192
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 "to those who are in Christ Jesus

193
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 "because through Christ Jesus, the law of the Spirit

194
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 "who gives life has set you free

195
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 "from the law of sin and death and shame."

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 So if you are feeling the weight of shame,

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 then today I want to encourage you to break the secrecy,

198
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 the silence, your own judgment.

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Talk to a trusted friend, see a pastor, a counselor,

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 a community group leader.

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Believe that because of Jesus,

202
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 we can confess our failures and sins,

203
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 know that we are forgiven,

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 and shame has absolutely no hold over us.

205
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And as a community, as the Vine Church,

206
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 should we let's be less judgmental,

207
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 stop the criticism, stop the pretense of perfection,

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 and instead be known for our empathy,

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 our love, and our grace?

210
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Shame has no place in the body of Christ.

211
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 When Elizabeth confirms her pregnancy,

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 the shame that Zachariah had doubted

213
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 could have festered within him.

214
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 However, we see that he makes the important decision

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 to choose to be vulnerable, to surrender and trust.

216
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 So he decides to obey the angel's instruction

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 and he's surrounded by his community

218
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 when he names his son John,

219
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 therefore declaring the hope in a future salvation.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And that shame, along with his silence, is broken.

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And sandwiched in this story is another story,

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 and this is the story of Mary, the mother of Jesus.

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I love this painting.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 This is by the artist Henry of Sawatana,

225
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 because while it's rich in symbolism,

226
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 it captures the vulnerability and simplicity

227
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 of Mary in her surroundings.

228
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Mary was a young woman, a teenager,

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 in the context of the culture of that time of marriageable age,

230
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 betrothed to Joseph, who was himself a descendant of King David.

231
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And we're told that the angel Gabriel was sent to Mary.

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And when he appears, she too responds with fear,

233
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 like Zachariah, but unlike Zachariah,

234
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 her fear is followed by a surrender and a trust.

235
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 So let's read from Luke 1, verses 30.

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 "But the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary.

237
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 "'You've found favor with God.

238
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 "'You will conceive and give birth to a son.

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 "'You are to call him Jesus.

240
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 "'He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.

241
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 "'The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,

242
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 "'and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever.

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 "'His kingdom will never end.'

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 "'How will this be?' Mary asked the angel.

245
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 "'Since I am a virgin.'

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 "The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will come on you.

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 "'The power of the Most High will overshadow you.

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 "'So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.

249
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 "'Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age.

250
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 "'She who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month,

251
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 "'for no word from God will ever fail.'

252
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 "'I am the Lord's servant,' Mary answered.

253
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 "'May your word to me be fulfilled.'

254
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 "Then the angel left her."

255
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 The 15th century Franciscan priest Roberto Caratiolo

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 describes Mary's response to her encounter with the angel Gabriel

257
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 as this emotional journey from this sense of disquiet, of being troubled,

258
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 to a reflection as she's listening,

259
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 to an inquiry as she begins to question,

260
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 and then to submission as she acknowledges she's the Lord's servant,

261
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 and later as merit as she is blessed.

262
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 But I think it can be too easy to dismiss the intensity of that moment

263
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 and the range of emotions for Mary,

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 especially as we, we're all familiar with her story.

265
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 We're familiar with the outcome.

266
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 But Mary, in real time, probably had no idea what the future would bring.

267
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 She's described as being deeply troubled,

268
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 even before the angel had told her what was happening.

269
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Mary probably knew because of her ancestry

270
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 that being singled out by God was a fearful blessing.

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 And for us, how often do we in the moment

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 find God's ways sometimes really overwhelming?

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 We too are on this emotional journey.

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 However, when we can look back, it becomes so much clearer.

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So as the angel delivered his message,

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 despite the enormity of what had been shared,

277
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 her humility and acceptance demonstrated a level of faith and trust in God,

278
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 even that of beyond a priest.

279
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 She was to be the mother of Israel's long-anticipated, long-awaited Messiah,

280
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 and her life would be turned upside down.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 God's plan for Mary was messy and risky.

282
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 The scandal for Mary to be pregnant and unmarried

283
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 exposed her to the rejection of Joseph.

284
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 But as with all God's plans,

285
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 he controlled the responses of those that mattered.

286
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And in the case of Mary, Joseph became Mary's number one protector.

287
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And we read that Joseph accepted Mary after he too was visited by an angel

288
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 and trusted God despite the social stigma he would also face.

289
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And I love that about God, how he works should be an encouragement to us.

290
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 We don't face our difficult, complex, messy situations alone,

291
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 and God is in control.

292
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I have heard so many stories of messy, difficult, complex, tragic situations,

293
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 and I have heard how God has stepped in and people have encountered

294
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 that God is with them and in control.

295
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 So what do these stories show us?

296
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 That even in mess, God is at work and God is in control.

297
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Mess for Zachariah was the failure to believe, his physical disability,

298
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 the embarrassment from his fellow priests and worshippers,

299
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 as well as the shame at having doubted.

300
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Mess for Mary was being pregnant, unmarried, the social ostracism,

301
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 the judgment, and possible rejection.

302
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Sometimes our choices mean we are responsible for the mess.

303
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 If Zachariah had chosen to believe instead of doubt,

304
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 his story would have been very different.

305
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 The angel was very clear in telling Zachariah that because he doubted,

306
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 he would not be able to speak.

307
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 But sometimes we have no control over the mess we find ourselves in,

308
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 like pregnant Mary who had no control over the cultural response of that day

309
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 and the rejection that could follow.

310
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Just like the characters in these stories, whether we are responsible or not,

311
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 we can choose how we respond in the mess.

312
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 You see, Zachariah eventually chose to see God in his answer prayer,

313
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 to surrender through obediently naming his son John

314
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 and trusting God as he declared his praise and thankfulness.

315
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Mary chose to see God despite not fully understanding,

316
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 surrendering herself and trusting God with an uncertain future.

317
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Through both stories, we can learn that how we choose to see God in our mess

318
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 will lead us to surrender and trust and then hope in a future.

319
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 So how do these stories become relevant to us?

320
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 A number of years ago, I worked for an organization

321
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 that provided funding for new companies

322
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 and injection of capital for those that wanted to diversify and grow.

323
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 My job was to interview prospective clients and to prepare a business plan.

324
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And then those business plans would then result in the funding being rejected or approved.

325
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 So I worked for this company for about just under a year.

326
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And during that time, got very close to all of my colleagues.

327
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 It was a family-run business and so even outside of work hours, we would meet up.

328
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Then just a week before Christmas, I arrived into the office

329
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 and I was told that the company had closed and I was to go home.

330
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Then shortly, we found out that actually the company that had been operating

331
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 had no funding, there was no money, and it was now under investigation.

332
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And so I went home also being told that there was also no money to pay the staff.

333
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And so a week before Christmas, we were told we would not get paid.

334
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 It was a messy Christmas.

335
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 I think one of the things that I really struggled with

336
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 was that knowing I had worked for a company for almost a year and I had no idea.

337
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And for me, I felt really embarrassed and I felt shame.

338
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 I'd worked in a company that was responsible for ultimately causing a lot of pain

339
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 and difficulty for organisation and companies.

340
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And I had no idea. People had been deceived.

341
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 There was pain and disruption in that.

342
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 And now I faced the harsh reality that also I was out of a job.

343
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 I had no money, my husband Richard was studying at the time,

344
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 and so we really didn't know what we were going to do.

345
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 But even though I had a lot of questions,

346
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 because after all, I thought God had provided this job for me,

347
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 the reality was this situation was way out of my control.

348
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 But I could control how I responded to it.

349
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 So I chose to lean into God, to try to see him in all of this mess.

350
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 And I asked him a lot of questions too.

351
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I chose to surrender my fear, my worry and my shame.

352
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And then I just chose to trust God that he was at work

353
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 and that he was the hope in my future.

354
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Didn't make sense to me, didn't have all the questions answered,

355
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 but I chose to trust God.

356
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It took about nine months before I got another job.

357
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 During that time it wasn't easy.

358
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And I remember we ate a lot of baked beans.

359
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And if you're from the UK, you will know that is the staple diet

360
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 if you have no money in the UK.

361
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 But even though it wasn't always easy,

362
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 and sometimes fear would creep in,

363
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 "What if I never get a job again?

364
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 What if nobody ever hires me?"

365
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 All of that, but I had to push through that

366
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 and keep on trusting that God was with me.

367
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 So eventually I got another job,

368
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 and that job turned out to be so much better than the other job.

369
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And eventually it would lead me to here in Hong Kong.

370
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 But I had to learn an important lesson,

371
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 that it was not about me getting a job.

372
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 I had to learn that the security of my future

373
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 was not tied up in my work.

374
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 The security of my future was in the redemptive work of the cross

375
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 that reconciled me back into a relationship with God

376
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 and then a hope in a future with Jesus

377
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 where there will be no more pain, no more death, no more sorrow.

378
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And this is the hopeful future that Zachariah and Mary saw

379
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 in the messages from the angel

380
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 that declared the ultimate fulfillment of the promised coming Messiah.

381
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 So what is your mess?

382
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And how do you see God?

383
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Because how you see God will determine how you surrender to Him,

384
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 how you trust Him, and where your hope comes from.

385
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 A hope that is not based on the changes in circumstances,

386
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 but a hope that is in the future,

387
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 because this life is temporary.

388
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Our future is secured forever beyond this life because of Jesus.

389
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 So the world may appear to be in a mess,

390
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 complete disorder,

391
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 but as the stories of Zachariah and Mary tell us

392
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 and as Scripture shows us time and time again,

393
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 God is no stranger to mess.

394
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 He actively uses it to demonstrate His power,

395
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 His sovereignty, and His love.

396
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And honestly, the world desperately needs to see God right now.

397
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 These needless wars raging around us

398
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 with so much destruction and devastation

399
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 and loss of life that is just not justifiable.

400
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 The economic decline with rising poverty levels,

401
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 global increase in anxieties and mental health disorders,

402
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 and here in our city of Hong Kong,

403
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 the alarming rise of young people's suicide or attempted suicide.

404
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 The world needs hope.

405
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Jesus is that hope.

406
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Both Zachariah and Mary knew that the future was in the promised redemption

407
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 of their people through the Messiah, Jesus.

408
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 And they were to play the most important roles

409
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 in ushering in the kingdom of heaven.

410
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 As Zachariah's son prepared the way for Jesus

411
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 and Mary gave birth to Jesus.

412
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Jesus is the answer to our world's mess.

413
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 But I can't help also wonder at the risk that God took

414
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 to have Jesus arrive as a baby,

415
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 totally weak and vulnerable,

416
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 dependent on his mother and earthly father,

417
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 but also guarded by his heavenly father.

418
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Because our God, our heavenly father, is in control.

419
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 So how we see, to surrender and trust God

420
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 is how we live with hope.

421
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 So what does that practically mean for us today?

422
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Well, we may not be visited by any angels anytime soon,

423
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 or you might, I mean I'm not saying you won't,

424
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 but don't just rely on that.

425
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 We can still see God.

426
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 We see God through scripture.

427
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 We read a lot about who God is and his character.

428
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 As we learned in our Exodus series,

429
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 God himself declares his character.

430
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 He says, "The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate

431
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 "and gracious God, slow to anger,

432
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 "abounding in love and faithfulness,

433
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 "maintaining love to thousands

434
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 "and forgiving wickedness, rebellion, and sin."

435
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 We see him through the incarnation of Jesus

436
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 and the life he recorded in the gospels.

437
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 We see God in the world around us,

438
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 the beauty of nature, the wonder of creation.

439
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Paul refers to this in Romans.

440
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 "For since the creation of the world,

441
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 "God's invisible qualities, his eternal power

442
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 "and divine nature have been clearly seen,

443
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 "being understood from what has been made

444
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 "so that people are without excuse."

445
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And David also in Psalm 19,

446
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 "The heavens declare the glory of God.

447
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 "The skies proclaim the work of his hands."

448
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 We can see in creation around us,

449
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 in the visible world, all that has been made by God

450
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 and his invisible power and divine nature.

451
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 So take time to watch the sunrise or the sunset.

452
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Take a walk in the mountains of Hong Kong

453
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 and see his splendor.

454
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Stand by the sea and watch the beauty

455
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 and the power of the waves.

456
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 See the beauty of the creatures.

457
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 See God all around you.

458
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And then as we grow in our understanding of who God is,

459
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 we truly see him, our natural response will be

460
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 we will want to surrender our lives to him.

461
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Now sometimes that's easier said than done.

462
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 So how can we practically surrender?

463
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 What does that mean?

464
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Well first it has to take humility.

465
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 We need to recognize and accept

466
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 we need God.

467
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 His ways are so much bigger than our own.

468
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 And one practical way that we can take time

469
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 is to regularly identify areas in our life

470
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 where we feel we're holding and struggling for control.

471
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And then confess your need to surrender to God,

472
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 to surrender whatever it is and allow him to control.

473
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Maybe it's overspending, overeating, drinking too much,

474
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 challenging family dynamics, difficult work relationships,

475
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 your job performance.

476
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Whatever it is that you're desperately trying to control,

477
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 bring it to God.

478
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Create a habit where you regularly come in prayer to God

479
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 with confession and surrender.

480
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Commit to growing your personal relationship with God.

481
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Be committed to a more intimate relationship

482
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 that involves spending time in prayer.

483
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Hang out with Jesus.

484
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Allow the Holy Spirit to guide you.

485
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Set some time aside that is away from distractions.

486
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Go for a walk and talk with Jesus.

487
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Sit and meditate on Jesus.

488
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Whatever works, find something that works for you.

489
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 It takes time and effort,

490
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 but any meaningful relationship does.

491
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 But it's worthwhile the investment of your time

492
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 because as you spend more time in relationship with Jesus,

493
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 you will see God more and you will want to surrender more.

494
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 You will trust more.

495
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 So it's a healthy cycle.

496
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Life is messy.

497
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 So this Christmas, embrace the mess.

498
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Choose to see God in the mess.

499
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Choose to surrender despite the mess.

500
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Choose to trust God with the mess

501
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 and you will know hope.

502
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Can I pray for us?

503
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Please would you stand.

504
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 (congregation murmurs)

505
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Father, I thank you for the honor it is to speak today.

506
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 I just ask that my words would take root.

507
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 The things that are from you,

508
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 the things that you're wanting to speak to us,

509
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 that they would not return void.

510
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Anything that is not of you,

511
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 then may it just disappear.

512
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 But Father, my heart is that we would be a people

513
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 that chooses to have hope in you, God,

514
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 because we desperately need to see you in the mess.

515
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 I thank you for Jesus.

516
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 I thank you that he is our hope.

517
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 He is our salvation.

518
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 And Father, I want to pray specifically

519
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 for those that are really struggling to see Jesus.

520
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 And one of the things that I sensed as I was praying

521
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 was that there is a spiritual blindness.

522
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 You know, as Jesus went in the gospels

523
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 and many of his stories are around healing

524
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 of those that were blind so they would see.

525
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 There's something significant about that.

526
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 For us here today, for some of us,

527
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 there's a spiritual blindness.

528
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Some of you know that, some of you don't.

529
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 And I believe that Jesus wants to heal us

530
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 of that spiritual blindness if you are willing.

531
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 And so, Father, I pray in the power of the Holy Spirit

532
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 that you would release people from this captivity

533
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 of spiritual blindness,

534
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 that they would know what it is to see you, God.

535
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 So much of this world overshadows us,

536
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 puts obstacles in our way,

537
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 but Jesus, would you remove all that

538
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 so you would be clearly seen.

539
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 God, we need to see you

540
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 because when we see you, we will respond in surrender.

541
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 And I pray for those here

542
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 that are choosing to surrender more.

543
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 I ask that you would give them the courage

544
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 to sit with you to identify those areas

545
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 and trust you will be with them.

546
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And I pray for anyone who has experienced

547
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 that captive nature of shame.

548
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 And I break the hold that shame has over us

549
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 as a church, as a community, as individuals.

550
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Father, may we respond with empathy towards one another,

551
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 love and grace towards one another.

552
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 And would we be a people that is free

553
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 from the hidden shackles of shame.

554
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Our future is in you, God.

555
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 And it is a hopeful, bright future.

556
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

557
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,840
 Amen.

558
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:44,840
