1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
 Hey church, I want to say thank you so much for reaching out all the messages

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,600
 that you sent to Ivan and me about the church plant. We're so excited about this

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,400
 and I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of you on Wednesday evening. But to start

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,760
 things off with the message I want to share with you about a YouTube video

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,680
 that I watched about a volcanic eruption in 2021 in La Palma which is an island

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:33,840
 in Spain. Now the volcano there was a lot of lava flowing that ruined homes and

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,360
 businesses and caused a lot of loss to the community. But the thing that really

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,200
 struck me about the video was the interviews and how differently people

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:53,260
 responded to the tragedy. One person that was being interviewed you could just see

10
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,800
 that they were despondent and they were just stuck. They didn't know how to move

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,560
 forward. And as I was watching that I couldn't help but to feel compassion for

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,720
 this person. I mean they were going through a lot. But then there was

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,320
 another person that also had lost so much. They lost their business facilities,

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,040
 they lost their home and they even lost some of their livestock. But this person

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,760
 responded quite differently with a lot of resilience. And they focused on what

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,520
 they were able to do which honestly was not that much. But he started setting up

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,480
 their business again and they vowed I will build back my house. And it was so

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,480
 moving and inspiring. Now watching this video made me wonder what allowed this

19
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:56,360
 one person to respond to this tragedy and these difficulties with such courage

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,800
 and resilience while other people were paralyzed and just stuck with what

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:09,280
 had happened. What allowed this one person to be so resilient in the face

22
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,480
 of these huge challenges? Now I'm sure there's a lot of answers to that

23
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,000
 question when you look through the history of the person's life. But it also

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,800
 made me think about our Christian faith. What allows individuals but also church

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:33,880
 to have a strong faith that they can face challenges? And to be more specific

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:42,400
 how can we as Christians in Hong Kong build a strong and a robust faith now

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:50,980
 that allows us to walk confidently and courageously into the future? So today

28
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,000
 we're continuing in our message series "The Unfinished Story" and we're gonna

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,080
 see a way that the early church inspires us to be the church in Hong Kong today.

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,560
 But before we get into the details of that I'm going to share with you a

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:13,640
 little bit about the context. Now the book of Acts is about the beginning of

32
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,560
 the church and the spread of the early Jesus movement. The Holy Jesus promised

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,280
 that the Holy Spirit would come upon the believers and when the Holy Spirit

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,680
 came on the day of Pentecost they were filled with the Spirit and one of them

35
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,040
 Peter he stood up and he gave an incredible sermon and he talked about

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,400
 the significance of who Jesus was, his death, his resurrection and that he was

37
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,680
 the Messiah, the one that Israel actually had been waiting for to deliver them, not

38
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,880
 just of Israel but of the world. And he called people to respond in repentance

39
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,680
 and faith and people were cut to the heart and he responded in faith. On that

40
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,160
 day 3,000 people, can you imagine that? 3,000 people came to faith and they

41
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,800
 joined the early Christian community. Now the part where we pick up the story is

42
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,880
 is this newly formed community and how they did life together and the practices

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,120
 that were important to them. So let's look at that. We're in Acts chapter 2

44
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,160
 and we're starting in verse 42 it says, "They devoted themselves to the apostles

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,940
 teaching and to fellowship and to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone

46
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:39,600
 was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,520
 the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property

48
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,600
 and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to

49
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,920
 meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and together

50
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:03,080
 with glad and sincere hearts they praised God and enjoyed the favor of all people.

51
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:12,040
 And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved." So here we

52
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,640
 have a summary of this life together of this early church and I believe it's

53
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,480
 these practices that helped the church build that solid faith to be in tune

54
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,200
 with the Spirit and to be such a vibrant, spirit-filled, mission-oriented church

55
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:37,160
 that could thrive despite challenges and persecution. So we're told that they

56
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,040
 devoted themselves to four things. The apostles teaching and to

57
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,160
 fellowship, the breaking of bread and to prayer. But before we get into those four

58
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,920
 practices I actually want to just take a moment and look at the word devoted

59
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,680
 because they devoted themselves to those four practices. Now the Greek word is

60
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:08,120
 "proskontaruntis" and besides meaning devoted it also means to persist in

61
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:17,440
 something, to hold fast to, to continue in and to persevere in something. So the

62
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,680
 early Christian community they persevered, they persisted in

63
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,760
 these practices and I believe it's these very practices that open up their lives

64
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,960
 to God and for the Holy Spirit to just lead them and guide them as they were

65
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,360
 this new movement and as this church that was birthed. Now what's so

66
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,800
 significant about these practices and how do they help us and even

67
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,200
 speak to us today about building a strong faith? Well let's look at that.

68
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,800
 Now the first thing that we're told that they devote themselves to is the

69
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,040
 apostles teaching. Now what in the world is that? Well the apostles were the

70
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,160
 twelve disciples of Jesus, that inner circle that was with Jesus, that

71
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,080
 ministered with him for three years, that heard Jesus' teaching and even

72
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,480
 they were taught by Jesus. But not only that, they also saw, they were

73
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:23,040
 eyewitnesses to what Jesus had done to his death, to his resurrection. So they

74
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,720
 taught the early church what they learned about Jesus.

75
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,320
 They gave testimony. But that's not the only thing they did. They also

76
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,680
 interpreted Israel's scriptures to the early church. Now what's Israel's

77
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,240
 scriptures? Well that's what we call the Old Testament. But they interpreted it in

78
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,000
 light of Jesus because Jesus himself had said that all scriptures are fulfilled

79
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,760
 in him. And so they showed that Jesus was the Messiah, the one that

80
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,840
 Israel had been waiting for, that the whole world had been waiting for, and that

81
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,000
 he is the Redeemer. And so you can even see that when you look at Acts chapter 2,

82
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,440
 the story just before this part that we're talking about, where Peter, he

83
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,720
 drew on a lot of Old Testament, but he interpreted through the lens of Jesus'

84
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,520
 coming and what Jesus did. So for us, what is the apostles teaching today? Well

85
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,020
 it's really the letters in the books of the New Testament, but it's also the

86
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,680
 larger story which includes the Old Testament. It's just that we read it

87
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:33,680
 through the lens of Jesus. So what did it mean for the early church to be

88
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:42,280
 devoted to the apostles' teaching? Well it meant that God's Word, Jesus' teaching,

89
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,840
 they played a central role in the community's life. They were committed to

90
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,640
 learning about Jesus, but not only to learning information, but to actually

91
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,320
 living it out. So being devoted to the apostles' teaching was not just about

92
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,320
 learning about Jesus, as important as it is, but it also was about having a

93
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:14,480
 personal encounter with Jesus. So when they gathered and they heard the

94
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,680
 teaching, Jesus made himself known to them. They met him personally, they

95
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,320
 communed with him, they spent time in his presence, and they heard him speak through

96
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,800
 these words and the Holy Spirit. Now what might being devoted to the apostles'

97
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,680
 teaching or to God's Word, what might that mean for us today? Well first it

98
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,360
 also means keeping God's Word central in our lives. It means prioritizing,

99
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,520
 spending time in God's Word, and then we can do that in a variety of ways. One of

100
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,040
 them we're doing right now is through listening to sermons and

101
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,680
 teaching, but we can also do it through Bible studies, like the one today at 2pm

102
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,760
 that you can join on Zoom. You can also by reading with friends and

103
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,600
 family or by yourself, or even if that's more helpful for you, listening to an

104
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,000
 app. Actually the early church, they didn't own Bibles, they

105
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,800
 heard it, it was passed on mostly through the Word, so they were actually listening

106
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,200
 to the messages. So when you listen on the app, you're actually doing what the

107
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:29,560
 early church did. But the second way that we can be devoted to

108
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:37,160
 the apostles' teaching today has to do with how we approach God's Word. Now a lot

109
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,640
 of times we approach God's Word informationally. We focus on the

110
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,280
 information in the stories, maybe the characters, you know, there's God and

111
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,240
 there's this person and this other person, or the narrative structure, and we

112
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,720
 gather all this information. And that's important. We actually want to

113
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,560
 absorb all those things. But reading the Bible informationally and learning the

114
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,880
 facts, it's not enough. We also need to learn to read the Bible relationally. The

115
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,440
 Bible is not an end in itself. You know, our focus is to encounter God, and God

116
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:24,040
 makes himself known to us through his Word, personally. And so when we come to

117
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,120
 God's Word and we read the Bible, we need to read it relationally because we want

118
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,400
 to engage in that relationship with God. We want to hear him speak. Now when I was

119
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,840
 a community groups pastor, a lot of times I told community group leaders as they

120
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,240
 transitioned into the time in God's Word that sometimes it was helpful to remind

121
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,040
 a group of saying something like, "Hey, right now we're gonna transition into

122
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,240
 time of God's Word." And I believe that God wants to speak to us. You know, he has

123
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,600
 something to say to us, so let's prepare our hearts. Let's be expectant. You know,

124
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,800
 there is something about this posture when we come, that when we expect

125
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:12,120
 that Jesus will speak. Now in my observation as a pastor, people usually

126
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,280
 don't struggle with the informational approach. That's actually what comes

127
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,400
 natural and easy, and there's a logical reason for that. That's how we're trained

128
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,280
 to read. When you study in school, you're trained to read information. You need to

129
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,160
 get all the information so you can answer the questions on the test. Or even

130
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,200
 in business, when you read the business report and the data and the stats, you

131
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,880
 read for information to fish it out. So that's quite natural that we approach

132
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,800
 God's way. But one thing that I found practical and very helpful and that

133
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,480
 helps us have this relational approach to God's Word is to read the Bible

134
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:57,480
 prayerfully. And when I do that, I usually pay attention to the highs and the lows,

135
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,160
 and I journal on them. Well, what are the highs and lows? What am I talking about?

136
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,280
 Well, the highs are the words and verses that stick out to me. They just kind of

137
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:14,520
 pop out when I'm reading, prayerfully reading the Bible, and they resonate

138
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:22,120
 deeply in my heart. And so one example, even as I was preparing the sermon, was

139
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,360
 this word "devoted," as I was preparing this message, it just popped out to

140
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,560
 me. And so then I prayed over it and seeking to understand what is God

141
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,200
 saying. And what I got is that God is calling us to persist in these

142
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,720
 practices to make them, you know, get back to the basics, to make them central

143
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,960
 again. But what are the lows? What is that about? Well, the lows are words and

144
00:13:51,960 --> 00:14:00,120
 verses that challenge us or unsettle us. And so as I was reading also this

145
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,720
 passage, the thing that was a little bit unsettling to me and that challenged me,

146
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,020
 and I believe also us here as well, was verse 44 and 45, where it says, "All the

147
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,600
 believers were together and they had everything in common. They sold property

148
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:24,640
 and possessions to give to anyone who had need." So a low, it might challenge us

149
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:31,640
 where maybe our lives is not aligned with God's will or purpose, where we're

150
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,280
 living a little bit differently than God is actually calling us to. But it could

151
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,520
 also be something where God just wants us to know Him more fully. Maybe we don't

152
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,560
 know that God is this generous, incredible God. And so that sticks

153
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,240
 out to us. So lows does not mean bad. It just means that the Holy Spirit is

154
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,480
 highlighting something to us that we need to hear. So as these highs and lows

155
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:05,200
 pop up, as you're reading the Bible prayerfully, allow yourself to pause. You

156
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,960
 don't need to rush on and talk to God or journal and ask Him, "Lord, what are you,

157
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,520
 why are you highlighting this to me?" And God will speak to us and He gives us

158
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,080
 words, you know, to His church but also individually and in season. And again,

159
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,320
 it's this personal encounter when we make God's Word central in our lives. So

160
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,480
 when we read the Bible prayerfully, it is a lot of times at the highs and lows

161
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,840
 that the Holy Spirit is speaking to us. So one way that we can build and

162
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,640
 strengthen our faith is when we make God's Word central in our lives and we

163
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:47,200
 open ourselves up for this relationship and for God to speak to us. Now another

164
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,440
 practice that the early church devoted themselves to was the breaking of bread.

165
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,080
 Now what is that referring to? Well, it's referring to this meal that Jesus

166
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,600
 told His disciples He wanted them to observe. And basically in this meal,

167
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,200
 Jesus was explaining the significance of His life, His death, and His resurrection.

168
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,920
 In particular, the significance of what Jesus did on the cross. And we call it

169
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,480
 communion, we call it the Lord's Supper, depending on what tradition you're

170
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,440
 from. And so in verse 46 and in our passage, we're told that they broke bread

171
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,200
 in their homes and ate together. So the early church, they celebrated

172
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,480
 communion just on their normal everyday meals. So it was not this once-a-month

173
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,840
 special occasion, but it was something that happened continuously. And this

174
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:51,200
 practice was a way of putting Jesus at the center of their community. And each

175
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,520
 time the early church did that, they remembered when they broke the bread

176
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,920
 that Jesus gave His body for them on the cross. And when they drank the wine, they

177
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,720
 remembered that Jesus gave them forgiveness, but He also made a new

178
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,600
 covenant with them. And they also remembered that Jesus one day will come

179
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,240
 again and He will finish the work, His redeeming work that He has started. So by

180
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,040
 celebrating this meal and the breaking of the bread regularly, the early

181
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,760
 church put the gospel at the center of their community life. But there's another

182
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:35,800
 aspect that's often overlooked. Breaking the bread together is a powerful way of

183
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,200
 displaying the gospel. When we share meals, or even at that time, meals,

184
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,160
 there was a lot of separation when it came to eating. Now the way I always

185
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,640
 picture it is with, you think of like a Netflix show or some film about eating

186
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,960
 in a high school cafeteria in the US. And you have like the cool table and then

187
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,080
 you have the nerd table or the not-so-cool kids table, and they don't

188
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,520
 eat together. And if you sit down at the wrong table, you will find out. Well in a

189
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,400
 similar way in Greco-Roman society, in Jewish culture, there was a lot of

190
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:18,160
 separation when it came to eating together. For Greco-Romans, a lot of

191
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:25,680
 it had to do with power and status and position. Even where you sat already said

192
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,240
 something about where you were on the social ladder. And there was even people

193
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,280
 you're not supposed to eat with, so you didn't eat with them at all. But in this

194
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,760
 early Christian community, which was right from the start, as we heard a few

195
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,800
 weeks ago from Pastor Andrew, was multi-ethnic and socioeconomic diverse

196
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,960
 community, they put Jesus at the center and they focused on the unity of being

197
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,120
 this one family and having shared authority in Jesus. It was not about

198
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,720
 pecking order. And really this is what Jesus had won on the cross for us, that

199
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,080
 we're one reconciled family. Because God makes us family and it's powerful

200
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,760
 when we share a meal at a table together. Now what might that mean for

201
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,120
 us today, being devoted to the breaking of the bread? Well at the Vine,

202
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,560
 we celebrate every first Sunday of the month, we celebrate communion. And I know

203
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,200
 there's been so many times where we're just really strengthened and

204
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:36,160
 encouraged, or just even deeply touched and moved by Jesus' forgiveness for me.

205
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,280
 But we don't have to just celebrate this once a month, we can celebrate it

206
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:49,880
 with our friends, with family, maybe with your small group. And so for us today

207
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,400
 this practice of celebrating communions is an anchoring practice that God

208
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:02,560
 uses to strengthen us, to nourish us, and to pour this grace over us.

209
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,240
 And it's a way of us telling the gospel to each other. You know we

210
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,040
 don't just need to hear the gospel once, and then come to faith. We need to

211
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,600
 hear it regularly, because we live by God's grace. We need to be reminded of it

212
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:23,400
 and moved by it. So by celebrating communion regularly, we can put Jesus and

213
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,200
 what he did at the center. But we're also declaring that Jesus has made us one

214
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,800
 family, because guess what? Today there still is a lot of separation when it

215
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,140
 comes to eating around the table. There's still a lot of division and strife, so

216
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:44,480
 don't underestimate the power of what is displayed, the beauty of the

217
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,860
 gospel, of how he makes us one family. So I'm wondering, what is one occasion this

218
00:20:52,860 --> 00:21:00,600
 week, maybe it's a family dinner or a time with a friend, where you can break

219
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,740
 bread together, and you can use 1st Corinthians 11 verse 23 through 26 to

220
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:16,960
 guide you. It's a way for you to keep the gospel central, and also a step of

221
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,500
 obedience, because Jesus told us and encouraged us to do this. Now another

222
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,260
 practice that the early church devoted themselves to was prayer. The word prayer

223
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,540
 is actually in the plural, so it's "prayers." So it includes corporate prayer,

224
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,940
 includes individual prayer, there probably also is a reference to

225
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,660
 praying during times of prayer, even along with the Jewish community, and

226
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:52,380
 praying Psalms. But when you read the book of Acts, I mean the theme of prayer

227
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,500
 it's so beautiful, I'm always so encouraged by it. You should do that

228
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,820
 sometime, just read through Acts, just focus on all the times when prayer is

229
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,900
 mentioned, when the church prays, and incredible stuff happens. So for example,

230
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:10,420
 early on when the church prays, they're seeking guidance for how to

231
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:17,100
 replace one of the Apostles, and God provides guidance. When Peter is

232
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,940
 arrested and then released, the church prays for courage and boldness, and I

233
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,380
 love this, they didn't pray to be safe, they prayed for courage and boldness, and

234
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,420
 then the place was shaken, and they were filled with the Spirit, and they were

235
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:39,620
 bold. Then later on, during prayer, there's a vision, and where the Holy Spirit

236
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:48,780
 speaks through the vision, and there's been separation, and people have

237
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,220
 been excluded, and God wants to remove those barriers, so He speaks

238
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,500
 to His church and prayer through a vision with Peter and

239
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,180
 Cornelius, and tears down those barriers that are keeping people out from

240
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:08,020
 the Christian community. So prayer for the early church was absolutely

241
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:14,540
 essential, and God met them, He spoke to them, and He moved powerfully through

242
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:21,780
 prayer. Now what might being devoted to prayer look like for us today? Well, we've

243
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,140
 also been given this incredible resource, you know, to pray individually,

244
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,580
 corporately, and God still speaks to us the same way. He still speaks to us the

245
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,140
 same way when we pray. It's not just us talking, even though we do that as well,

246
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,420
 but it's also God speaking to us, and He wants to meet us, and He wants to work

247
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,020
 through a church that prays, because when a church prays, powerful

248
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:54,900
 things happen. Now in my mid-20s, I was on a medical mission ship called Mercy

249
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,980
 Ships, and I attended a discipleship training school, and then part of the

250
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,660
 time I also helped out in the finance department, and during that time, I

251
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,660
 joined an early morning prayer before breakfast. Let me tell you, breakfast was

252
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:14,100
 really early, which was not my favorite time, but I really felt called to set

253
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,540
 aside that time, and what I loved about Mercy Ships was that they were open to

254
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,620
 having people serve that didn't have a Christian background. So they had a few,

255
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:31,220
 and one of those people was Rene, he was a German dentist, and so the

256
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,740
 prayer group in the morning, we got to know Rene on the ship, and over... Germans

257
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,060
 have a lot of vacations, so he was there on his vacation, so he was there five weeks or

258
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,500
 something, and over that time, you could just see his whole demeanor change,

259
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,540
 and you know, God was making himself known to him through the community, and

260
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,380
 so on the last day when he was supposed to leave, we were praying in the

261
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,780
 morning, and then suddenly we had the sense that it was important for Rene not

262
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,820
 to leave without becoming a Christian, and so we started praying into that, and

263
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,900
 suddenly we started praying that his flight was canceled so that he would

264
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:16,460
 have more time, and so we sent Rene off, and he went to the airport, and then

265
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,860
 suddenly later on that evening, I see Rene, and I was like, "Hey Rene, what's up?

266
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,740
 Why are you here?" It's like, "My flight was canceled." I was like, "No way," and he had

267
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,700
 to stay three more days, and he ended up placing his faith in Jesus. And I tell

268
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:38,300
 you, I was so in awe, because not only had God led us to pray, you know, while we're

269
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,700
 praying, he led us to pray in that way, but he powerfully worked through his

270
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,500
 prayer. Man, that strengthened my faith. You better believe that. So as a church,

271
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,620
 when we're devoted to prayer, God wants to strengthen our faith. He wants

272
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:03,500
 to bring forth that awe, because God moves when we pray. He moves powerfully.

273
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:12,580
 So maybe what is one way this week that you can devote yourself to prayer? And

274
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:21,620
 finally, we're told that they devoted themselves to fellowship. Now the Greek

275
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,420
 word for fellowship, it's probably the best-known Greek word, koinonia, it

276
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,780
 means sharing in common. Now what do we share in common? Well, it's the experience

277
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:37,020
 of Jesus' saving work in our lives, and the pouring out of the Spirit, and we

278
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:43,140
 share this life in Christ, in common, together. There's a beautiful description

279
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,820
 in our passage where this koinonia, this life together, is pictured. So I

280
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,740
 want to read this to you. It's in verse 44 through, I will go through

281
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:59,540
 verse 46, and it says, "All the believers were together," so you see the emphasis on

282
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:06,180
 together, "and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to

283
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:12,340
 give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the

284
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,780
 temple courts. They broke bread in their homes, and they ate together with glad

285
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,340
 and sincere hearts." So they met together, they ate together, and for them it was

286
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:30,180
 important to gather in these more intimate settings and in smaller groups,

287
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:36,100
 but to also gather as a large group in the temple courts. And when they did that,

288
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:43,020
 they did hear the Apostles' teaching, they did pray together, they did care for each

289
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:50,860
 other in an amazingly generous way, and it's a spirit-filled generosity. It's

290
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,620
 like a king, you know, they thought it was not just be a drudging thing, "Oh no, I have

291
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:02,220
 to give." It was a joyful thing, it was an investment in the kingdom, and they

292
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:08,380
 also broke bread together. So what's the significance for us, for being devoted

293
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:14,780
 to fellowship, to Koinonia here in Hong Kong? What does that look like?

294
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,300
 Well, one of the obvious things is that we're meant to be both in those more

295
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:26,980
 intimate and in this larger settings where we do life together, and God gives

296
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:32,220
 us each other so that we can encourage each other and build each other up in

297
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,900
 our faith and strengthen each other. And we actually need each other. Christianity

298
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,620
 is not meant to be lived on our own. I don't know about you, but I've

299
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:47,900
 experienced so many times God working through brothers and sisters in my life,

300
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:54,140
 you know, both in the joys and in the sorrows and in the in-betweens, and

301
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:02,260
 it is so powerful when we get to share life together. And there's also a

302
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,020
 deep caring for one another and in knowing what the needs are, because when

303
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,980
 we know each other well, we also know when someone is in need, and then the

304
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,780
 community can rise to the occasion, and we can care for each other in a steep

305
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:22,220
 way. So we don't have to walk into the future in Hong Kong by ourselves, but we

306
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,980
 can get to walk in the future as a church family together, and we can have

307
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:39,080
 the support network so we can face this future with faith and courage. So if you

308
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,920
 haven't been able to connect to one of our smaller communities, we have a lot of

309
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,840
 incredible ones. Actually, let me tell you about a few of them. We have a Filipino

310
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,560
 community called Philcom, we have the Cantonese community, we have the Mandarin

311
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,940
 community, we have community groups, of course, we have the K4C community. They're

312
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:02,220
 also a community of parents and children. We have, of course, community groups. We

313
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:09,060
 have a RISE community. So do go scan that QR code and check out ways for

314
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,100
 getting connected. Maybe that is, for some of you, really the step that

315
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:21,220
 God is inviting you to take today. So God strengthens us when we are devoted to

316
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:29,300
 fellowship. Now at the beginning of the message, I asked how can we as Christians

317
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:37,060
 in Hong Kong strengthen and build a robust faith now so that we can walk

318
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:42,940
 confidently and courageously into the future? Well, our passage gives us the

319
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:50,060
 answer. We can strengthen our faith by being devoted to the Apostles' teaching, to

320
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:56,540
 God's Word, by being devoted to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and

321
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:05,340
 to prayer. The church is weak when it is not devoted to God's Word, does not live

322
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:14,180
 in fellowship, does not pray, and does not break bread together. But when we commit

323
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,380
 ourselves to these practices and we persist in them, you know, something

324
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:26,020
 beautiful happens. We open our lives to God and God fills us with this Holy

325
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:34,580
 Spirit. And this beautiful, courageous, and vibrant, and Spirit-filled faith and

326
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:44,540
 community moves forward. So let me ask you this. In what ways right now are you

327
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:52,860
 sensing the Holy Spirit inviting you to respond to this message? Which one of

328
00:31:52,860 --> 00:32:03,020
 these four areas has God been speaking to you about? And what is one concrete

329
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:11,780
 way that you are going to respond? Church, I don't know about you, but I am so

330
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:18,300
 inspired and moved when I look at this community, this early Christian

331
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,700
 community, and all the implications for us, and how it inspires us, how we can be

332
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,020
 the church, and how God wants to strengthen us in the season in our faith.

333
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:37,460
 And you know, we're gonna get to write this beautiful chapter of this

334
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:48,420
 unfinished story of the church in Hong Kong. Well church, let me pray for us.

335
00:32:48,420 --> 00:33:02,060
 Jesus, I thank you so much that you make us family, that you invite us

336
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:07,180
 into a relationship with you, that you speak to us when we spend time in your

337
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,100
 Word, that you make your will and your purpose for us known, that you give us

338
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,580
 personal words that we need to hear. Jesus, I thank you that you give us

339
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,100
 prayer, that when we just talk with you, when we converse with you, that

340
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:27,580
 you speak to us, that you give us visions, that you guide your church.

341
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:33,020
 And Jesus, I thank you for fellowship, that we get to do this life together,

342
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:39,260
 that we're not on our own. We can walk into this future faithfully,

343
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,140
 and with strong and a resilient faith, because we have each other, and you

344
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:51,060
 use us to strengthen each other. And so Lord, I just pray that you would

345
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,540
 fill us now with your Spirit, and that you will lead us as we respond, and

346
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:02,500
 go back to these basics, and just make the space in our lives for you. I pray

347
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,140
 all this in your name Jesus amen
