[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   Well, good morning, everyone.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.880]   Thank you so much for joining us here today.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.040]   2020 is coming to an end.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.440]   Can I hear an amen?
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.040]   And some of you are saying, finally.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.400]   It was about time.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.560]   Hey, to start things off in a bit of a lighter way,
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.160]   I want to do a review that I call Remember When.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.040]   Now, remember when the pandemic first hit
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480]   and we became experts on sourcing masks?
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.640]   Now, I want to share with you about my moment of glory.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.000]   I feel really good about this.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.920]   I was at a friend's New Year's party,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.280]   and word came out that HKTV Mall was
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.680]   going to be selling some masks.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.040]   And so we all got online on our phones,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.620]   and we got ready to the strike.
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.600]   And when those masks became available,
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.780]   I managed to secure 90.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.780]   And I was so excited.
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.580]   I felt like I finally arrived in Hong Kong.
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.740]   I know how to take care of stuff here.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.580]   You know, that's not that easy.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.260]   But then I also realized that I actually
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.820]   had an oven sitting in my HKTV Mall cart
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.220]   that I not only bought masks, but I also bought an oven.
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.480]   So I got masks and an oven.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.460]   But hey, you know, in the pandemic,
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.780]   that wasn't that bad of a thing.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.140]   But I just was not as cool as I thought I was.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.500]   Now, we managed to source masks from all over the world.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.260]   You know, some of us on our own.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.860]   Hong Kong people are really resourceful.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.540]   They know how to get stuff.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.820]   Some of us collaborated with friends, family, co-workers,
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.500]   and they sent us masks here, only for us
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.260]   to send them back to them as the pandemic spread
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.580]   and when they needed masks and didn't have them.
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.620]   Remember when we could go on vacations
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.900]   and didn't have to quarantine?
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.100]   Yeah, me neither.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.820]   Man, I miss traveling.
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.980]   You know, that's one of the things I was really excited
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.220]   about coming back to Asia was the travel.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.540]   Remember when we became Zoom experts?
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.740]   We're like, hey, virus, we're going to bypass you.
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.700]   You have nothing on us.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.380]   We're going to go digital online.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.900]   And so we learned about things like a virtual background,
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.020]   which works for some of us.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.620]   We have good enough computers and chips
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.580]   in our computer.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.340]   For others, not so much.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.260]   We learned about Zoom fatigue.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.740]   Anyone experience Zoom fatigue?
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.100]   Hey, you can put a comment in the feed
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.380]   if you know what Zoom fatigue's like.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.140]   I certainly have experienced that.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.900]   But we also learned about Zoom etiquette.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.860]   Well, that's at least some of us.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.900]   There's always that one person on the call
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.420]   who does not mute themselves.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.300]   Hit the mute button.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.900]   Come on, you can do it.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.300]   Hey, remember when-- and by the way,
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.860]   this is the height of my review right here.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.180]   This is the zenith, the pinnacle.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.900]   You know what I want to share with you?
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.740]   Remember when we were scared of running--
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.860]   you guessed it-- out of toilet paper,
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.620]   and we got in touch with our inner hoarder,
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.820]   that little man, that little woman living inside of us?
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.860]   And we went into the stores and into drugstores,
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.780]   and we grabbed as much toilet paper and tissue
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.380]   as we could to make sure that we're secure.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.740]   Now, a neighbor from me, him and I,
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.140]   we can look into each other's windows.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.060]   You know, we pretend like we don't see each other, but we do.
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.860]   And so during that time, he had like stashes and stashes
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.540]   of like toilet paper and tissue there.
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.820]   And I started feeling insecure about what I had.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.660]   But he was like, that's not cool, man.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.420]   Why you got to take all the toilet paper?
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.060]   But remember also when we actually slowed down,
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.380]   and we took time with God, reading his word,
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.580]   spending time in prayer, experiencing him speaking to us.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.020]   Remember when we got to spend a lot of time at home,
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.740]   work from home, and even though there's challenges in that,
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.100]   but nonetheless, we got to experience these precious moments
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.460]   with people that we love, with our parents,
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.260]   with our children, with our spouses, with our friends.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.780]   Remember when we called each other,
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.220]   and we actually checked in to make sure the other person was okay.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.980]   And we went out on the streets, and we handed out hand sanitizer.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.860]   We handed out masks for those who couldn't afford them
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.780]   or wasn't able to source them for themselves.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.140]   Hey, what's your highlight of 2020?
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.460]   Let us know about it.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.180]   Put it in the comment.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.060]   We would love to hear your highlight.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.700]   Love to celebrate with you the good things that God has done this year.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.100]   But even though a lot of good things happened,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.180]   and they certainly have, and praise God for them,
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.340]   2020 has brought so many of us to our breaking points.
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.900]   And to one degree or another, we've experienced loss,
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.300]   we've experienced pain, exhaustion.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.940]   Traveling has been difficult.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.820]   Some of us have missed funerals, weddings of loved ones.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.420]   I got married this year to my lovely wife, Chris.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.980]   Woo-hoo!
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.580]   And we started with a civil union,
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.780]   which happened during the peak of the second wave.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.740]   So we had to uninvite 30 people, which is awkward
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.540]   if you ever have to uninvite people to something.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.180]   Not fun.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.620]   Then we had our church wedding during the peak of the third wave,
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.620]   so we had to shift everyone from actually being here in person
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.220]   to now joining us online, and we had to delay our banquet.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.300]   But by God's grace, we were able to have our banquet
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.740]   between the third and the fourth wave, and I'm really grateful for that.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.460]   But this year has been tough.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.020]   So many difficult things have happened.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.300]   Some of us have lost loved ones.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.900]   And if that's you, I just right now just want to send you the love
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.500]   from myself but also from the whole Vine family.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.180]   We love you and we care deeply about what has been happening in your life,
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:07:01.740]   and we just want to send you our love and hugs to you and to your family.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.300]   Many other things have happened.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.460]   You know, we've been scared of the virus.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.820]   We've been living in fear.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.260]   We've lost jobs.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.700]   We had to postpone our college plans.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.380]   Graduations were online instead of in person.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.620]   Church everywhere online.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.100]   Hey, thanks so much, you know, for joining us in this space,
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.620]   but we sure miss you here in person.
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.940]   But we're still glad we get to spend this time with you in this way.
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.220]   Parents became teachers at home, having to figure out how to navigate
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.740]   this whole working with their kids and collaborating with the class teachers
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.860]   and getting all the lessons done so that the kids don't fall behind.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.940]   Friends have lost friends who've moved.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.580]   So there's grieving people who have moved.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.380]   And then there's a lot of uncertainty about the future.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.740]   What's going to happen in 2021?
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.820]   Is there going to be a recession?
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:16.460]   Am I going to have my job or is the vaccine going to address all the issues?
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.860]   So I don't know what your 2020 has been like,
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.100]   but to one degree or another, we've all experienced pain and loss,
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.180]   and there's been challenges this year.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.700]   And so as I was thinking about what do I want to share with you today,
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.460]   you know, what is God putting on my heart,
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.940]   this passage came to mind that has been with me throughout the whole year,
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.820]   that has come up multiple times.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.980]   And that's a passage from the Gospel of Matthew,
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:53.380]   chapter 9, verse 35 through chapter 10, verse 5.
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:59.380]   And the reason why I want to choose this passage to share with you right now
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.580]   is because I believe that it's important for us to hear today,
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.860]   you know, that Jesus cares deeply about us,
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.140]   and he's aware of our circumstances.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.060]   He's aware of what's going on in your life.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.500]   But some of us were struggling to see that
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.220]   because this year has just blindsided us.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.780]   It's been so difficult.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.420]   And we don't feel like that Jesus is with us.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.420]   We don't feel like that Jesus cares, but he does.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:34.580]   And so in this message, I'm going to speak into the challenges of 2020,
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.940]   but I'm also going to be looking ahead
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:46.500]   and how Jesus invites us into very important work in 2021,
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.620]   the River Model Vision,
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.660]   you know, something that Pastor Andrew introduced two years ago in a Vision Sunday.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.940]   And so we're going to see how Jesus wants to speak to us now here in our challenges,
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.300]   but we're also going to be looking ahead.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.620]   So that's the plan for our time together.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:07.620]   So let me start by reading this passage in Matthew, chapter 9, verse 35.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.820]   And it says, "Jesus went through all the towns and villages,
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.820]   teaching in their synagogues,
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.380]   proclaiming the good news of the kingdom,
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.580]   and healing every disease and illness.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.980]   When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them,
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.580]   because they were harassed and helpless,
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.980]   like sheep without a shepherd."
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:42.660]   So first, we hear a summary of Jesus's ministry up until this point.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.820]   He's been going from town to town.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.460]   He's proclaiming the good news of the kingdom,
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.620]   but he's also demonstrating the kingdom by bringing healing
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.300]   and bringing wholeness to people.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:02.140]   But then Matthew, he mentions a metaphor of sheep and shepherd
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:11.060]   in order to help us to understand how Jesus sees the crowd.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.180]   That's actually a metaphor that Jesus himself uses elsewhere
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.740]   about himself, himself being the shepherd,
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.540]   but also Israel being the sheep.
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.060]   So for example, right after the passage that we're going to be looking at today,
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:30.580]   Jesus sends the disciples out to the lost sheep of Israel.
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.260]   So Israel are the lost sheep.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.580]   And then in the Gospel of John, he calls himself,
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:42.620]   he says about himself, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.900]   So not only did Jesus talk about this,
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.540]   but this was something that Jesus's contemporaries,
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.860]   they were familiar with.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.540]   It was a metaphor they knew,
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.620]   because throughout the Bible,
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.620]   there's this metaphor of sheep and shepherd.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.620]   Most of the time, it refers to sheep being Israel
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.420]   and shepherd actually being the leaders of Israel.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:07.060]   And a lot of times, it's a critique of their lack of leading Israel.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.860]   So Matthew, in our passage, he's using this metaphor
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.540]   to help us understand how Jesus sees the crowds
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.340]   and what's going on with them.
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.820]   And so as he's been walking around,
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.500]   he's been making these observations,
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.260]   and he sees that the people, they're without protection.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.100]   They're vulnerable. They're harassed.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.980]   They're helpless.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.620]   They find themselves in a place of destitute.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.700]   So during that time, there was Roman occupation.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.500]   There was an oppressor that really turned up the screws
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.500]   or turned down the screws tight,
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.700]   you know, taking money.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.660]   So a lot of people were struggling economically.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.300]   But then also just not having the freedoms
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.660]   that the people desired to have.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.420]   But then there was also things like spiritual oppression.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:05.300]   And then just normal life, economic concerns, heartbreaks.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.900]   And so what Jesus sees when he looks at the crowd of people
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:16.180]   is he sees people that are barely making it.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.860]   That's what Jesus sees.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:24.460]   And he sees their struggle, and he sees their pain.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.020]   And he sees their lack of resources
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.220]   and their place of destitute
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.540]   and their need for somebody to come and lead them
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:39.380]   out of that place, to guide them.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.500]   But it does not just stop there.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.580]   Jesus not only sees and observes the struggles
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.660]   and the pain of the people.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.100]   You know, that'd be like, just imagine that.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.220]   Like he's like, "Oh, there's a lot of pain.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.740]   Oh, well, that sucks."
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.660]   You know, and then he just moves on.
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.620]   But that's not what he does.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:04.980]   We're told in verse 36 that Jesus had compassion on them.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.580]   He allows himself to be deeply moved and touched
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.300]   by what's happening in people's lives.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.820]   He cares deeply about every single person
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.260]   and what's going on in their lives.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.980]   Every single person.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.900]   Tim Keller, a well-known pastor from New York City,
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:33.500]   he says this, "Compassion means to get yourself involved
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.260]   and make yourself vulnerable."
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.060]   So it's two things.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.500]   Get yourself involved, make yourself vulnerable.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.900]   Well, Jesus, he made himself vulnerable.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.180]   We just celebrated Christmas.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.580]   It's all about Jesus making himself vulnerable
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:53.620]   and coming to us, coming into our lives to rescue us,
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:58.140]   but also to see and identify with our pain.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.460]   And so he makes himself vulnerable.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.020]   He allows himself to be impacted by that,
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.460]   but it does not stop there.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.260]   He also gets involved.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.780]   He gets involved in people's physical pain,
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.380]   and he heals them.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.140]   He gets involved in people's emotional pain
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:27.180]   by taking away shame, restoring people's dignity,
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.620]   and comforting them,
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.860]   and telling them about their true identity.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.300]   And he gets involved in people's spiritual pain,
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.100]   whether that's spiritual oppression or sinfulness
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.260]   that is just working havoc in our lives.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.020]   And so he lays down his life
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.300]   and all those who place their trust in him
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.940]   can experience his deliverance
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.540]   and this newness of life that he gives.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:02.140]   So Jesus is not a passive bystander.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.420]   He gets involved, and this love and compassion
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.060]   that a lot of us and a lot of you
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.980]   that are watching here today have experienced,
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.900]   you know, it flows through Jesus
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.620]   because he deeply cares about every one of us.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.660]   And Jesus, he sees your 2020,
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:29.060]   and he cares deeply about what you are going through.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.100]   He's deeply touched and moved
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.180]   by what is going on in your life,
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.700]   and he wants you to know that today
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.660]   because we need to hear that.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.740]   Because just like those people back there,
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.860]   there's a lot of us barely hanging on.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.940]   You know, we're barely making it.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.420]   And we need to hear this word today
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:56.300]   that Jesus, he knows, he sees, and he is involved.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.900]   But there's a problem.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.620]   When things don't turn out the way we hope for,
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:09.100]   or when we walk through a lot of painful experiences,
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.820]   we tend to withdraw from Jesus
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.860]   and we withhold our struggles from him.
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.220]   Now, in our Bible passage today,
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.940]   we see that even when we are in that place of withdrawal
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.540]   or pain or hurt, Jesus draws near to us.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.700]   He has compassion for us.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.140]   He cares about our struggles, your worry, your fear,
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.300]   your grief, your pain, your anger,
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:45.700]   your sadness, your frustration, your helplessness.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.860]   He cares about you and he wants you to know that,
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.140]   and he wants you to know that right now.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.300]   Jesus says about himself, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.860]   And the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.140]   Jesus doesn't withhold anything from us, nothing.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:08.020]   He has given everything for you, everything for me.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.540]   He's not a bad shepherd.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.780]   He's the good shepherd.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.060]   Bad shepherds abandon their sheep.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.140]   They leave them vulnerable and exposed,
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.780]   but that's not Jesus.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.780]   Jesus doesn't leave you vulnerable and exposed.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:28.020]   He's with you every step of the way.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:32.100]   And he's also the one and the only one who is powerful
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:37.940]   and able to lead us to our destination.
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:43.380]   And so right now, I want to invite you to pour out your heart
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:49.140]   in prayer to him and to experience his comfort,
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:58.740]   his care, his healing presence as he meets you right now.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.380]   So I want to encourage you at home.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.700]   You know, it doesn't matter who's around you,
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.460]   even if you're on the go and watching this.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.620]   I want to encourage you right now just to do some real talk
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.580]   with Jesus.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.900]   Just tell him what you're feeling and what's going on.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.780]   You know, even if you're barely struggling to do that,
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.860]   you know, that's actually a step of faith.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.700]   And even if it's so hard, and when we do that,
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.100]   Jesus, you know, he reveals himself to us
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.140]   and we get to experience him working.
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.900]   So right now we're going to take like 20 seconds or so,
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.660]   and I just want to invite you to pray.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.300]   So if you close your eyes with me right now,
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:42.660]   wherever you are, and just pour out your heart to Jesus.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.340]   Jesus wants to meet you right now.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.820]   He wants you to know that he is with you.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.540]   He has not abandoned you.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.860]   And he wants you to know his love,
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.780]   and he wants you to have hope.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.300]   I'm with you.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.060]   You're going to make it.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.580]   I'm going to carry you through.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.140]   So pour out your heart to him right now.
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:28.540]   (soft music)
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.380]   Jesus, you've heard right now all the prayers.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:38.260]   Even if it was just like some stuttering or some,
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.460]   I'm in pain, some very simple words.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.860]   And Jesus, I pray right now that your presence,
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.620]   wherever we are, that you would just fill that space
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.660]   with your presence, that you would make yourself known,
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.340]   that you would start the healing process,
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.300]   that you lift burdens off people,
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.540]   that we could feel that release that you can only bring.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.180]   So Holy Spirit, I just pray that you would move
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.660]   powerfully right now.
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.340]   Lord, we desire that we pray for that,
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.940]   and we know you're able,
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.460]   and we know you are the good shepherd
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.460]   who doesn't abandon us, who is still with us,
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.820]   and who will see us through.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.900]   So I pray that you would release faith, hope, and courage
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.620]   right now, in your name, Jesus.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.460]   Amen.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.260]   (soft music)
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:38.380]   Now, besides Jesus meeting us in this difficult space
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.980]   that a lot of us are finding ourselves in,
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.660]   and by the way, I do wanna encourage you
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.820]   to keep just pouring out your heart to Jesus
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.500]   and experiencing him meeting you.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.860]   Even if you don't know him, you can talk to him,
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.820]   and he'll meet you, he'll make himself known to you.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.620]   But besides Jesus showing us his compassion,
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:05.980]   I want us to think about what does Jesus see
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.420]   when he looks at Hong Kong in 2020?
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.340]   What does he see?
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.860]   What does Jesus want his church to see and do?
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:21.180]   And I believe that the river model vision
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.220]   that we as a church have been called to
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.580]   is about seeing our neighbors' circumstances
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:34.340]   and allowing ourselves to be filled with compassion
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:40.460]   for our neighbors, and to get involved in people's lives.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:48.060]   Jesus wants his compassion in 2021 to flow through us
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.660]   to our neighbors, to the people here in the city
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.220]   that need his love, his compassion,
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.060]   that need to be touched,
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.260]   that need to know that there is a good shepherd.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.860]   So as we step into 2021,
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.180]   we need to see our neighbors struggle.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.980]   So as you have been looking around your neighborhood,
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.300]   what are you seeing?
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:19.220]   What is the spiritual, emotional, and physical condition
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.660]   of the people around you?
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.940]   Who is Jesus highlighting to you?
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:30.940]   Actually, I want to ask you to comment right now
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.420]   on the feed below.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.740]   Let us know what has been Jesus highlighting to you.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.780]   What are you seeing?
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.020]   What are you observing?
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:45.140]   Now, I believe that Jesus, he highlights specific people
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.140]   to us, that we are uniquely positioned
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.180]   to love, to serve, and to impact.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.900]   So what are you seeing?
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.020]   What are you noticing?
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:05.260]   Do you see the elderly neighbor that's barely making it,
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.820]   who needs some help?
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:13.460]   Do you see asylum seekers,
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.460]   our brothers and sisters who are struggling,
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.940]   especially now even more so than before during COVID?
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.500]   Do you see people's spiritual condition?
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.860]   Maybe they have the financial resources
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.940]   and they're doing it from that perspective, fine,
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.580]   but they're just lacking that joy
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.980]   or that purpose in their lives.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.820]   And you see that and it pains you.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.260]   What is Jesus highlighting to you?
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.580]   Do you see the single parent
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.420]   that needs others to come around him or her
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.860]   and just walk with that parent?
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.780]   And with the child?
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.460]   You know, what do you see?
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.660]   Whom is Jesus highlighting to you?
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.380]   Where do you find yourself filled with compassion,
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.180]   deeply moved and stirred?
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.420]   Pay attention to that.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:09.860]   Could it be that Jesus wants to work uniquely in that area
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:14.380]   that you see and where you are moved to compassion?
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.940]   What do you think?
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.340]   So as we make those observations about the people around us
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.700]   and we become aware of the needs,
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.420]   you know, there's usually two ways that we respond to that.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.700]   One of them is, I just wanna get involved right away
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.980]   and I jump right into action.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.900]   And a lot of times we burn out when we do that
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.540]   or it's just a short lift, you know,
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.500]   we do it for a little bit and then we move on.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.380]   The other reaction, I think this is the,
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.540]   probably the more common one,
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:49.500]   is that we see our neighbors,
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.060]   we see their need,
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.180]   we start to understand the complexities
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.780]   of the issues that they're facing
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.500]   and we just get so overwhelmed.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.340]   And we feel so small and we're like,
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.860]   I don't know what I can do or where to even start.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.140]   And then even though we're moved,
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.380]   we don't know what to do with it
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.100]   and then after a while we just,
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.300]   in order to not have this cognitive dissonance,
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.100]   we set it on the back shelf
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.100]   and we just move on with our lives.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.940]   And I think that's the way that Satan snatches away
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.460]   those things that he has, the Holy Spirit has sown
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.500]   and that he wants to move through us this year in 2021.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:34.780]   But Jesus, he actually provides us some perspective on that
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.300]   and so I wanna share it with you,
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.460]   continuing in Matthew 9, verse 37, it says,
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.300]   then he said to his disciples,
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.580]   the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.660]   Ask the Lord of the harvest,
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.700]   therefore to send out workers into the harvest field.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.820]   And I love this here.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.700]   Jesus acknowledges that the difficult reality,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.020]   the harvest is plentiful, there's so much to do,
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.540]   but the workers are few.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:11.860]   But he also tells us what to do
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.580]   and it's not what we tend to do,
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.460]   it's not jumping right into
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.940]   or disengaging and just feeling overwhelmed
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.580]   and not doing anything, it's neither of just two things.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:25.580]   He tells us in this overwhelming need to start with prayer.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:31.340]   And it's prayer that propels us forward
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.860]   in responding in a powerful way
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.980]   to the needs that we see around us.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.180]   It's prayer that leads us and propels us
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:44.100]   into living out the river model vision in 2021.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.940]   Besides the Lord's Prayer, by the way,
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.980]   this is the only time where Jesus tells us
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.380]   specifically what to pray for.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.020]   Where he actually gives us the content, pray this.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.300]   So we should pay attention to that.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.980]   And Jesus is saying, don't get overwhelmed,
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.300]   don't get stuck in that place,
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.180]   don't just rush also into it,
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.740]   but pray and remember who I am.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.980]   I'm the Lord of the harvest, I'm already,
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.260]   I'm the good shepherd, I'm already working in people's lives.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.260]   I'm the one who gives divine appointments,
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:24.060]   I'm the one who transforms and who changes lives.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.100]   I'm the one who has all the resources that are needed
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.380]   to love this city.
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.740]   Start with prayer.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:38.300]   And when his church prays,
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.420]   and when his church prays, guess what happens?
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:47.020]   The river starts flowing
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:51.700]   'cause Jesus starts sending out his river workers.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:56.620]   Now, the word for being sent out, and I love this,
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.380]   this is actually my favorite little nugget
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.340]   from this passage, is ekbalo.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.260]   And it actually can be translated as cast out,
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.580]   flung out, drive out, thrust out.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.020]   Now, just think about this.
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:17.020]   Jesus is telling us to pray that we, his people, the church,
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.300]   is gonna be cast out.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.300]   This is the same word that Jesus used to cast out a demon.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:29.220]   So he's telling us to pray for workers to be cast out.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.580]   Now, why is that?
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.300]   Well, I think the answer is obvious
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.940]   'cause a lot of times we're living in our comfort place
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.780]   and we're just dealing with our own lives.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:47.220]   Or we are living in this place of just being overwhelmed
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.980]   and we need the powerful move of the Holy Spirit
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.860]   to light a fire in our belly to go out
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:59.380]   and to do the work that Jesus is inviting us into,
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.980]   his healing, his redeeming, his restoring work.
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.380]   So I wanna challenge you this year to pray
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:11.780]   that Jesus will cast us out as his river workers
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.500]   all over Hong Kong.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.300]   And in January, we are having our fast,
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.660]   so that's a perfect time, you have no excuse.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.580]   That's a perfect time to be praying.
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.580]   So let's see what happens as we do that.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:27.020]   Now, in Matthew 10, one through five,
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.140]   so we're gonna continue looking here at this passage,
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.660]   and I'm not gonna read all of this.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.820]   I'm not gonna butcher all the disciples' names,
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.660]   but I'm gonna just read a couple of verses.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.900]   He says, "Jesus called his 12 disciples to him
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:43.260]   "and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.420]   "and to heal every disease and illness."
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.180]   And then there's a name of the 12 apostles,
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.340]   and I continue in verse five.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.580]   He says, "These 12 Jesus sent out.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:31:00.340]   "The disciples prayed for workers to be sent out,
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.180]   "and then Jesus sends them out.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.020]   "They're the answer to their prayer.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.580]   "When Jesus commissions them as apostles,
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.520]   "as sent out ones, he gives them authority
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.860]   "to cast out evil spirits and to heal
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.140]   "every disease and affliction."
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.740]   And in other words, he provides for them
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:26.520]   the gifts of ministry that they need to do his work.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.420]   And guess what?
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.740]   When we pray about being cast out,
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.740]   now Jesus, he also, when Jesus sends us out
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.740]   to carry out the river model vision,
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.580]   he empowers us for the task at hand,
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.500]   and he also gives us the specific gifts of ministry
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.380]   that we need to carry out his work.
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.100]   This is something that we can be encouraged by,
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.900]   because Jesus, he sets us up for success, not for failure.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.600]   He calls us into something that we can actually do.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:05.420]   Now, in this passage, there's a significant shift
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.420]   and transformation.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.300]   The disciples of Jesus, they've been sort of tagging along
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.580]   with Jesus and watching him,
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.980]   and it must have been pretty cool to watch him.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.980]   I wish I could have been one of the disciples
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.700]   during that time and seen Jesus in that way in action.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.740]   But they've been watching him.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.600]   And so now, through this prayer,
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.740]   there's a transformation.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:31.740]   They become active participants in Jesus's work.
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.180]   They're no longer just observers.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.780]   They're active participants.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.820]   Now, I believe that Jesus is calling us,
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.580]   he wants to do a shift in us as a church
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.980]   from watching maybe ministry leaders,
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.460]   or there's always a certain group of people
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.700]   who do a lot of watching them and just being observers.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.540]   He wants to shift us to being his river workers
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.360]   and active participants in what he wants to do
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.160]   in Hong Kong in 2021.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.200]   Now, this shift, it's a supernatural thing.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.880]   We can't force that on our own.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.360]   It's the Holy Spirit working in us.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.760]   And so let's pray for that.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:15.080]   So how can we step into 2021
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.380]   and start living out the river model vision?
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.000]   How do we do that?
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.100]   Well, first, start with prayer.
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.960]   Pray for workers to be cast out into the city
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.000]   as his river workers.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.540]   Next, realize that Jesus, he uses the word workers.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.500]   The Greek word for workers,
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.980]   here used here is ergates,
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.260]   which simply means an agricultural worker or laborer.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.420]   So Jesus, he tells us to pray for workers.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:57.420]   Not for expert community developers, theologians,
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.160]   particular personality types.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:05.420]   If someone has those skills or that personality,
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.360]   that's awesome.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.980]   But he tells us to pray for ordinary people
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.320]   like you and like me to go out and do his work.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.780]   But we struggle with that, don't we?
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.700]   A lot of times we feel inadequate
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.860]   or we don't feel qualified
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.940]   or we feel like we're lacking something
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.260]   or we personally become 50 times more mature.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:34.260]   And so we don't think that God can use us
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.720]   and work through us.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:40.300]   However, even small acts of service can be used by God
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.100]   to achieve his purposes
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.920]   because we are not acting in our own strength,
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.220]   but out of God's strength
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.880]   and we're sent by his authority
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.740]   and we're equipped with his giftings.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.660]   Now let me share with you a true story.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.860]   This is a story from the US.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.380]   There was a high school student and he was walking home
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:06.180]   and then he was looking over and he saw this other student
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.340]   and the student was dropping his books.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.300]   He was carrying a lot of books,
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.300]   so he decided, you know what, I'm gonna go over.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.640]   And so he helped the student pick up the books.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.820]   And then he was thinking to himself,
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.140]   hey, if I don't help this person carry home,
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.220]   I'm just gonna keep dropping them,
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.780]   so I'm just gonna walk home with them.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.660]   So he helped him carry the books home.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:28.500]   And they started talking and they had a great conversation
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.580]   and a friendship grew out of that.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:34.580]   So several months later,
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.540]   the student that had dropped the books,
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.220]   he told his friend,
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.140]   hey, do you remember the day when we first met?
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.100]   Yeah, yeah, of course I do.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.180]   He's like, do you know why I had all these books
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.060]   with me that day?
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.360]   He's like, no.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.360]   Well, I had gone to school,
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.880]   I had cleared out my locker
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:03.360]   'cause nobody talked to me, nobody cared for me,
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.980]   and I was gonna take my life.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.880]   That day, you saved my life.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:21.840]   Never underestimate small acts of kindness and compassion
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.340]   and how God can use them.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.000]   He wants to work powerfully through them.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.600]   He wants to touch people's lives
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.280]   through you here in Hong Kong.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.880]   He wants his love and compassion to flow through you.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:42.180]   Now, the river model vision,
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.400]   it's more about regularly practicing small acts of kindness
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.280]   and mercy than one-off grand gestures.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.680]   So it's about that daily dying to self
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.720]   and going that little bit out of our way
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.320]   to help somebody pick up books
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.040]   or to pay attention to somebody, listen to someone,
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.720]   to ask somebody out for lunch.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:10.840]   And don't underestimate how God wants to work through you
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.400]   and touch people's lives.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.160]   Now, I wanna leave you with two, what I call,
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.000]   and I'm really excited about this term, by the way,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.320]   river habits that you can practice.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:26.780]   The first one is reach out to two people each week
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.380]   to see how they're doing.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:32.360]   It's as simple, every one of us can do that.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.760]   And I wanna encourage you to go above and beyond
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.680]   the people you usually reach out to or talk to.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.120]   So don't talk to your best friend,
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.000]   you're already talking to them anyhow.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.360]   And just give them a call,
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   take some time to talk to your neighbor,
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.800]   talk to somebody at your workplace,
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.120]   but also talk to somebody at church
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.000]   that maybe you don't know that well.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.080]   So talk to two people every week and see how they're doing.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.400]   And put that in your calendar, by the way,
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.880]   if you don't put it in your calendar, it doesn't happen.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.520]   Second, the second river habit,
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.640]   bless someone this week.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.280]   Go again, above and beyond what you normally would do.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.680]   Buy somebody some awesome coffee,
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.460]   buy a family that's struggling with groceries,
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.320]   buy some groceries and get to know them better.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.200]   Encourage someone with a note
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.760]   or with some really thoughtful words
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.000]   that you're gonna share with them.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.920]   So I wanna challenge you to choose
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.120]   one of these two habits this week and to practice them
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:38.580]   and trust that God will work through them.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.220]   Tell someone that you're gonna do that,
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.780]   like invite your community group and talk to your spouse,
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.780]   talk to your friend and challenge them to do it as well
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.980]   and see what happens as Christ's compassion flows through you
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.220]   to the people around you.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.140]   The city that we love,
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.260]   the people that we love are in pain.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:05.100]   In 2021, will we make ourselves available
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.020]   to be God's river workers?
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.060]   Let me pray for us.
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:16.020]   Jesus, you have seen our 2020,
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.300]   you care deeply about it,
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.020]   but not only ours, but also for this whole city.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.580]   And you want everyone to know you as the good shepherd
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.420]   and you want your love to flow through the city
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:33.500]   where there's hope and new life and transformation.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.040]   And Jesus, I pray that you would cast us out
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.860]   as your river workers in 2021,
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.900]   that we would say yes to that,
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.980]   that we would allow ourselves to be used by you
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.060]   for your kingdom purpose.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.100]   Now pray right now also for those who just maybe,
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.040]   we don't feel confident that you would give them,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.140]   that you would release faith and encourage to do this,
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.380]   that even this week as we practice these habits,
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.300]   that we already would experience you working through that.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.580]   And also wanna pray for those
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.780]   who are still struggling and in pain,
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.080]   that you would bring people around them to walk with them,
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.000]   that we know that you are with them,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.800]   that you would continue to reveal yourself
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.920]   and just lift those burdens
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.480]   and that you would speak to them, give them specific words
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.120]   that will guide them and give them direction and hope.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.160]   And so we pray that you would help us
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.240]   to wrap up this 2020 well,
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:29.200]   but also that you would bless our 2021.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.920]   And so into your hands, we commit that.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.080]   In your name, Jesus, amen.
