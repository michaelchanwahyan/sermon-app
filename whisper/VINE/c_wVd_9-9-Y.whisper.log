[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   So good to see you all once again.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.720]   You know, next year, around summertime, next summer, it marks 20 years since God first
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.000]   called me to full-time ministry.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.520]   In 2004, I was 16 and I just finished public exam in Hong Kong and my youth pastor brought
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.640]   me and some of my friends from church to a youth summer camp.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.320]   I was in Wukai Sha, thousand people.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.600]   It was really packed.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.160]   The worship was amazing.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.080]   I remember a little bit what the preachers was talking about, but then I remember the
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.360]   worship in particular.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.840]   I still remember what songs we sing and I remember what I saw, the pictures that I saw
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.840]   in worship.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.840]   And one of those was like this.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.520]   When I was worshiping God, I just saw this picture of Jesus walking towards me slowly.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.080]   When he reached me, he stretched out his arms, his nail-piece arms towards me.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.880]   The next thing I remember, I was wailing and wailing and wailing.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.200]   It's kind of like God is filling me with his love like never before.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.040]   I just keep wailing like there's this waterfall of God's love like crushing me.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040]   And then I heard this.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.680]   This is just a voice in my head saying, "Are you willing to give me the rest of your life,
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.400]   to follow me, to serve me?"
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.520]   All right, I need to tell you something about me first.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.480]   So when I was born, not long after I was born, my mom found out that she had cancer.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.720]   And it was in the hospital that she accepted Jesus.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.360]   That's how me and my family, we started going to church.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.820]   But when the day I turned three, she passed away.
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.400]   She went home to be with the Lord.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.920]   And so if you ask me, ever since I was three years old, "Chapman, what would you like to
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920]   do with your life?"
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.240]   I would tell you 100% I wanted to be a doctor.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.280]   Simple.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.160]   I want to help people.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.360]   I want to help people to prevent like things that happened to my mom would happen to them.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.400]   That's my dream, my aspiration, if you will.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.440]   But somehow when I was in that young youth camp, summer camp in 2004, when I was worshiping,
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.320]   when I heard these words, "Would you follow me for the rest of your life and serve me?"
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.760]   Somehow I know I have this dream or aspiration, but saying yes to God was like a no-brainer.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.120]   I said yes.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.480]   And there's this part of me inside thinking, "Yeah, I think I'm quite capable."
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.520]   You know, I was in a pretty good school in New Territories.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.640]   I lived in Tsuen Wan when I grew up.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.400]   I was in a better class in school, so I'm quite capable.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.040]   If God wants to call someone, yeah, of course it would be me.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.600]   Little did I know that my life was going to turn upside down.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.160]   When I got into university, I was this Christian young man on fire for God, so I would go to
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.640]   the Christian fellowship, I'd go to campus crusades, whatever the meetings are, prayer
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.640]   meetings.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.720]   I went to all the Christian events and meetings that I could ever heard of.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.560]   So people, when they see me on the outside, I'm this very spiritual, very on fire young
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.080]   man for Jesus, but they don't know what's going on inside of me.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.240]   Actually, I was struggling with my studies.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.960]   So after one or two semesters in university, I started not being able to meet deadlines
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.240]   of my assignments, and I failed one or two classes.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.480]   And I became so ashamed of myself.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.920]   I thought I should be living the perfect Christian life, like every single area of my life should
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.120]   be perfect.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.560]   I should be the one telling people, you know what, God called me to be a pastor one day,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.840]   so now I am leading a perfect life.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.240]   Come on, let's see.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.960]   I thought that would be the way, but it was the total opposite, and I was so ashamed of
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   myself.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.560]   So I started to distance myself from my friends.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.960]   I didn't want them to see what's going on with me.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.720]   I don't want to face them.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.680]   And I started to skip classes.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.200]   I remember there was one day I had this particular class.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.480]   We have certain level, a standard of attendance.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.620]   If I skip another class, I would just fail the entire course one more time.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.760]   So that day, I had an 8.30 a.m. class.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.920]   When I woke up and looked at the clock, it was 9.09 a.m.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.720]   Well, luckily, I stayed in dorm.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.840]   It's a 10-minute run, not walk, 10-minute run, so I rushed to the classroom.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.960]   I was like jogging or running, and I'm like, "I finally reached the door."
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   It's very simple.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.920]   All I have to do is open the door, grab a seat.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.920]   Nobody's going to see me.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.560]   Just pay attention, and then that's it.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.200]   But when I was standing at the door, this huge fear just started to overwhelm me.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.560]   I started to have these mental rehearsals of people, how they're going to look at me,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.040]   my classmates, what they're going to say about me.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.840]   And I was just frozen at the door.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.480]   But then I remember, I'm a Christian.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.120]   I can pray to God about these kind of things.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.000]   So I gathered my courage to pray.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.240]   I said, "God, please help me.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.560]   I don't know what to do right now.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   I'm at the door.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.560]   I should go in, but I don't want to go in.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.560]   I don't know what to do."
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   And I prayed.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.520]   And after one minute, no, I'm still very afraid.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.520]   I have to pray again.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.520]   So I prayed for two minutes.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.600]   I prayed for three minutes, four minutes, and five minutes until eventually I gathered
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.920]   all my strength and courage.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.920]   I turned back.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.040]   I went back to my dorm and I slept.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.200]   I slept for two weeks.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.640]   I didn't see people.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.600]   I didn't get out of my room.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.280]   I didn't take a shower.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.520]   I don't know you've been there, that you slept so much until your head hurts.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.080]   You must get up because if you keep lying down here, your head is hurting.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.320]   That's what happened to me.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.960]   When I woke up, I would just go and take a cup noodle, eat it, and then I continue to
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   lie down.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.240]   Later on, I figure out or someone told me that's called depression.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.160]   At the end of that semester, I dropped out of school.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.080]   And I told myself, "God called me to be a pastor, not doing some other whatever that
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080]   is.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.960]   Maybe if I go to a seminary, things will be different."
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.400]   So I got the guts to sign up, apply for a seminary, and that seminary accepted me.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.720]   And so I started, I thought, "Okay, now I'm living out my calling."
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.200]   But guess what?
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.400]   The whole thing, the whole cycle repeated itself.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.520]   I failed to meet deadlines again.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.120]   I skipped classes again.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.240]   I dropped out once again.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.720]   At the age of 23, I dropped out of school twice.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.400]   I was sitting on the bus, the upper deck of the bus, because I was so ashamed of myself.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.520]   Even if I take a bus, I would stay at the back of the upper deck.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.160]   And I look out the window, and these words came out of my mouth.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.600]   I asked God, "God, have I heard you like wrongly?
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.160]   Did I hear you wrongly?
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.800]   Did I make a mistake or have you made a mistake?
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.680]   Because I could never be the one that you called."
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:40.920]   You see, second guessing or doubts, questioning ourselves, questioning even God.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.480]   This is just almost like a reflex.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.960]   When we hit a brick wall or face immense challenge or failures in life, doubt is something that
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.680]   almost every single person experience at a certain point in their life.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.440]   If we look at the dictionary definition of the word doubt, it says this, "Doubt is the
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.160]   feeling of uncertainty or lack of conviction."
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.860]   When I was 16, I was pretty convinced that God has called me into ministry to be a pastor.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:15.600]   But as I hit one wall after another, as I failed one time after another, my level of
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.760]   conviction just started to go downhill until by the time I was 23, if there is a tank that
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.720]   contains my faith, I would say that tank was completely empty.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.360]   I lack conviction.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:36.320]   I was uncertain if God has said those very words to me in the first place in that summer
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.680]   camp.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.920]   Perhaps you've been faithful at your job, you worked really hard, but you didn't get
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.840]   the promotion you expected or you deserved.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.960]   Or maybe you've been praying for healing or for the well-being of someone you really
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   love.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.720]   You've been praying day and night for that, yet, or maybe it's a family member, yet you're
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.560]   there at the hospital watching them suffer.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.880]   You may even be following God faithfully and in your everyday life and serving faithfully
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:15.720]   at church, diligently pour out your time, your resources, your energy, your love, but
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.040]   in the end, you're hurt.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.320]   You thought, "Nobody really understands me.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.640]   People hurt me."
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.000]   And you're so discouraged by people at church or even maybe you're so discouraged by God
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.280]   himself that you were wondering if you should just walk away.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:40.920]   Modern psychologists, they view doubt as a natural part of human experience.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:49.240]   It arises within us because we have this ability to think critically and question our surroundings.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:58.680]   So no wonder in our lives when doubt presents itself, it's always in the form of a question.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:07.120]   You see, in Christmas or this Christmas narrative, the author of the Bible did not shy away from
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:13.640]   many stories of doubt or try to present to us a perfect humanity.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.880]   Luke actually opened his Jesus story with a story of doubt.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.560]   But at the same time, I believe if we spend some time together to dive into it today,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.760]   we would find the same encouragement that people found in this story.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.320]   Shall we pray?
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.480]   Father, we are here to open your Word today because we know there is power in your Word.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.680]   We just simply pray that God, we're here, we open our ears, please speak to us, Lord.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.800]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.040]   We're going to look at Luke chapter 1.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.520]   I'm starting with verse 5.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.840]   In the time of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.960]   to the priestly division of Abijah.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.920]   His wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.240]   Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.440]   decrees blamelessly.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.800]   But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.400]   And they were both very old.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.440]   At the beginning of the Gospel of Luke, we were introduced to this priest whose name
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.120]   is Zechariah.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.720]   Not only that he is a priest, his wife is also a daughter of a priest.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:30.120]   The priesthood of Israel, it was established back in the days during the Exodus when Moses,
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.080]   you know, were establishing the tabernacle, which later became the temple.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.640]   Moses also appointed the priesthood.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.400]   The first high priest was Moses' brother, Aaron.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.920]   So you see, like, Elizabeth, she's a descendant of Aaron, the high priest.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:53.040]   And so temple and priesthood, this is a system of worship for the Israelites.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.580]   This is how they worship God, worship Yahweh.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.800]   And priests are the ones who exclusively work inside a temple.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   You got to know this, you cannot apply to be a priest.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.400]   You cannot say, "I want to be a priest.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.160]   Let me write an email, send in my CV.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.440]   Hey, I want to be a priest."
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.160]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.480]   You are either born to be a priest or you are not.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:22.680]   Out of the 12 tribes of Israel, only the Levites, they were chosen to be priest.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.520]   They were born into it.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:32.640]   So here we see that Zechariah and Elizabeth, they were born in a very noble and prestige
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.760]   background.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.240]   Being a priest in Israel means you are part of this leadership together with the king
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.240]   and the prophets.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.640]   They are born to be in the leadership class of Israel.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.440]   And not only that, the Bible also said they're not just noble or honorable in their social
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.200]   status, they had amazing character as well.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.840]   Luke said they are blameless.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.160]   So if you were a first century reader of the Bible, you would understand this.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.960]   You would understand this perfect couple to be super respected, highly respected in the
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   Jewish society.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.520]   But, there's always a but to the story, right?
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:16.460]   But they were childless and they were very old.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:22.360]   In the Jewish context, childbearing, it's always regarded as a blessing from God.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:28.120]   Not only that, when a couple was not able to conceive, not able to have children, it
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.440]   could lead to social scrutiny, whispers, and even shame.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:39.720]   Childlessness was sometimes viewed as a sign of God's disfavor or punishment.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:45.800]   Could you imagine the emotional pain and social challenges that this couple would have faced
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.880]   throughout their entire life?
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:53.400]   They did their best to follow God, do everything God has asked, yet they were caught in a situation
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.440]   that suggested God's favor was not on them.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.560]   Or even worse, that they were punished by God.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.640]   For sure, they would have been praying for a child or for a son for many, many years,
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.400]   but that prayer was never answered.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.360]   Now Zechariah's life, in his life, he has only one job.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.880]   As a priest, he's there to pray on behalf of the Israelites, yet he has been living
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.600]   all these years with the biggest unanswered prayer in his life.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.720]   Could you imagine with me for a moment, if you were a fellow Jew, would you want this
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.880]   guy to pray on your behalf that his own prayer wasn't even answered?
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:40.200]   Or on the flip side, if you were Zechariah, would you still think you're qualified for
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.400]   your job?
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.200]   Let's continue to read from verse eight.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.880]   Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as a priest before God,
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.960]   he was chosen by lot according to the custom of the priesthood to go into the temple of
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.080]   the Lord and burn incense.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:04.240]   And when the time of the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   outside.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.280]   Here, Luke suddenly brought us to a time where Zechariah was at work.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   Give us a glimpse of his work.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.320]   You need to know that in the Jewish priesthood, there were 24 divisions in total.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.720]   And besides major festivals where they're all needed because we need all hands on deck
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.880]   during the major festivals, but during other time of the year, they only have to serve
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.480]   two times.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.840]   Each time is just a week.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.440]   That's the best news for pastors, right?
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.280]   If you get a whole year of salary, but you only have to work two times a year, two weeks
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.240]   a year, or maybe Easter and Christmas.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.920]   Hallelujah, right?
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.200]   No, we don't think like that.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.560]   We're very diligent, right Tim?
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.080]   We're very diligent.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.520]   So they only have to work two times a year.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.800]   And because there were so many priests in the entire Israel, it's the entire tribe of
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.840]   the nation.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:16:00.200]   That's why every single priest, they only get to go into the temple to burn incense
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.760]   once in their entire lifetime.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.200]   They only get one chance.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.920]   And Luke was telling us, this is Zechariah's moment.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.120]   This is at the peak of his career.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.720]   This is the moment where he's going to do what he was chosen to do in the first place.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.600]   This is as close to Yahweh, the God of Israel, or the creator of universe as close as he
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.600]   could be.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.420]   I was born for this moment.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:31.840]   So old Zechariah went into the holy place of the temple and it says there, verse 11,
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.760]   "Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   incense.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.560]   When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped by fear.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.880]   But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid, Zechariah.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.440]   Your prayer has been heard.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.080]   Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son and you are to call him John.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.000]   He will be a joy and delight to you and many will rejoice because of his birth.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.480]   For he will be great in the sight of the Lord.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.400]   He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.120]   Spirit even before he is born."
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.120]   Wow.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.000]   "He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.560]   go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the parents
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:21.680]   to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready a people
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.000]   prepared for the Lord."
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.720]   Wow.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.680]   Could there be an even more perfect ending to this?
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.780]   Like your prayer has been heard.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:39.880]   If having a son or a child was something Zechariah and Elizabeth has been praying every day for
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   their entire life, they could probably have been praying for that for about like 30, 40,
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880]   50 years.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.720]   Let's just say it's 40, right?
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:53.960]   If they pray every day, 365 times a year, and they've been praying that for 40 years,
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.880]   that would roughly equal to about 15,000 times.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.120]   I wonder if anyone here who has prayed one prayer for 15,000 times in your life.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.120]   Right?
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.120]   No?
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120]   Okay.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.640]   So that's a lot, right?
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.980]   And I wonder, you know, how their prayer life would look like.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.820]   This is how I imagine.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.640]   Maybe when they were first married, they would say things like this, "Dear God, thank you
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.320]   for giving us each other.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.880]   Now we're happily married.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.800]   We're ready to start a family.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.640]   We pray that you will give us a beautiful gift of a child.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   Nothing happened."
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.640]   All right.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:42.000]   You know, sometimes God has his own timetable, his own timeline.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.040]   Then it became, "Dear God, we respect your timetable.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.800]   We trust in you.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.680]   We pray that you will give us a child when you see fit.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   Amen."
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.280]   Still nothing after years.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.400]   Maybe after a while it will become like this.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.840]   "God, I'm not sure if you've heard our prayers.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.600]   I didn't know if you get the message previously.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.920]   You know, if there's something you're not happy with us, you can tell us.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.360]   Like, if there's something, if in my job as a priest I made any mistakes, please reveal
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.720]   to me so I can do a better job, I can be a better man.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.040]   Or if there's anything we as a couple, we sinned against you, please reveal to us so
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.680]   that we can set a record straight so that we could finally have the blessing in our
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.680]   life.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   Because everyone is telling us if we don't have a child, it must be our sin.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.880]   It must be our own mistakes.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.280]   So God, please reveal to us what have we done wrong.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   Amen."
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:49.720]   And perhaps after years, after years, years, finally one day they pray this.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.920]   "It's okay, God.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.280]   It doesn't matter anymore.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.720]   I cannot bear that pain.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:03.680]   I cannot bear looking at that empty room in my house that I've prepared for a baby anymore.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   I can't do it.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.680]   I can't take it.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:14.000]   God, why don't, yeah, why don't we just pretend we never had this conversation before?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.520]   I'm ready to let go.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.920]   I'm ready to move on.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.920]   I'm so old.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.920]   My wife is so old.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   There's no more chance for us.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.400]   Let's just forget it about God.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   Forget it, God.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.520]   I'll still worship you.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.520]   I'll still work for you.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:34.280]   I'll still do what you ask, but just let's forget about this."
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.320]   I don't know how long it has been.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.440]   I don't know how many times they have prayed this prayer.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.600]   Probably he don't remember praying these or how he felt when he prayed that anymore, but
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.400]   at the climax of his career, Zechariah was met by a heavenly being showing up and saying
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.200]   these words, "Your prayer has been heard."
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.640]   My prayer has been heard?
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:06.340]   You know, I've been praying this prayer for no less than 15,000 times for years.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:12.620]   My fellow priests, my community, my neighbors, my relatives, they all told me that God must
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.360]   have already heard my prayer.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   He's merciful.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.360]   He's faithful.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.800]   He would do something.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.680]   And look what I've got here right now.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.680]   Nothing.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.680]   Nothing.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.280]   What do you expect from me?
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.480]   Now you're telling me that's going to be a child?
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.880]   You know, when I was young, I was so certain.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.880]   I was so convinced that God has heard my prayer and would answer it.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.880]   Now I'm not sure anymore.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.640]   I'm not certain anymore.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.200]   I'm not expecting anything else from God anymore.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.160]   And you're telling me that there's a chance that God has listened to my prayer and He's
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.040]   answering me right now?
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.400]   How can I be sure of this?
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.620]   How would I know?
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.820]   How can I be certain?
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.820]   No doubt.
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.600]   This is a story of doubt.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.160]   Here we have old Zechariah.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:16.520]   He's an old priest, a lifetime servant of God who for years walked a righteous and blameless
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.520]   life.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.120]   Yet he still struggled with doubt like you and me and anybody else.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:26.200]   So today, if you have any doubt about God, you're not alone in this room.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.680]   And you have to see that the story of Gabriel's visit to Zechariah was immediately followed
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.480]   by his visit to Mary.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.400]   So let me paraphrase the story.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.360]   Unlike Zechariah and Elizabeth who were very old, Mary was just engaged and not married
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.360]   yet.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.080]   In other words, she's very likely to be just a teenager.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.680]   And Gabriel appeared in very similar ways, said something very similar that he told Mary
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.480]   how she would bear a child, but this child will be the son of the Most High.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.640]   He will be the Savior of the world and his kingdom will never end.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.560]   If you're married, like a son?
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.280]   I'm not even married yet.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.400]   That's all she said.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.480]   But I've not been married yet.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.120]   How could this happen?
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.080]   How will this be?
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:18.960]   You know, Luke put these two stories side by side and he show us two people, one old
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.920]   priest Zechariah and a young virgin Mary, a teenager, who both have their reasonable
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.080]   doubts about what God has just told them.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.680]   But Luke recorded their two responses in form of two questions.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:37.440]   Zechariah, in his doubt, he asked, "How can I be sure of this?
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.040]   How can I be certain?"
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.440]   In other words, he was looking for certainty.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.360]   Gabriel responded by pointing out that, "You did not believe my words," which were indeed
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.840]   the very word of God.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:57.360]   So Gabriel was saying that, you know, he pointed out Zechariah's unbelief.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.280]   So this morning we're juggling a few different concepts here and allowed me to explain how
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.960]   they're all connected to each other.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.000]   First we talk about the idea of doubt, which I mentioned, doubt is the feeling within us
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.640]   when we're uncertain about something or when we lack conviction.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:20.300]   It's not uncommon when doubt arises within the context of faith, right?
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.880]   Sometimes we wonder if God really loves us, if he listened to us, listened to our prayers,
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.280]   or simply wonder if God is even real.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:34.120]   Are we delusional to believe that there is a being called God in this world?
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:40.680]   As Christians or as human beings, we will experience doubt throughout our lifespan,
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:48.120]   not just in faith, but in many areas of our life, like self-doubt I just mentioned earlier.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.120]   That's about doubt.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.800]   Then we have this idea, this concept called unbelief.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.360]   What is it?
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.560]   Unbelief is the decision to live your life as if there is no God.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:04.240]   And it is totally possible, let me say this, it's totally possible for us to be Christian
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.840]   and to be unbelieving at the same time.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.840]   Seriously?
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.000]   How?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.960]   We can come to church gatherings every week and sing songs and pray to God, yet we don't
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:21.560]   believe he has ultimate authority and he works in each and every area in our lives.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:26.360]   Yes, I believe in God, but I have my own plans for my career.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.280]   I pray to God for my problems many times.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.280]   It just doesn't go away.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.240]   I don't know why I'm speaking in Singaporean accent, but it just doesn't go away.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.960]   I guess God, he's not interested or he's too busy.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.400]   I'll just have to handle this myself.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.240]   Sorry for the accent, I don't know where it comes from.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.560]   Whenever you see, whenever there's an area in your life, we decided to ask God to stay
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.040]   out of it and say, "You know, God, I'll handle it myself."
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:57.440]   That's the exact area where we harbor unbelief in our lives.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.640]   And now it's important to know this.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.480]   Doubt is not unbelief, but it can become unbelief.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.800]   Let me say this again.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.320]   Doubt is not unbelief, but doubt can become unbelief.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.720]   I'm going to read from a professor of theology in the UK.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.320]   His name is Alistair McGrath.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.320]   He wrote this.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.840]   "When does doubt become unbelief?
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.040]   Answer, when you let it.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.080]   When you cling to unrealistic ideas about faith, when you, if you believe that you can
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:34.520]   or need to know everything with absolute certainty, your faith will be in difficulties very soon.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.160]   But faith isn't like that.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.960]   Faith is about being willing to live, trusting in the existence and promises of God, knowing
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.320]   that one day that existence and those promises will be totally vindicated.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:52.040]   But for the moment, we walk by faith and not by sight."
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.440]   In other words, when Zechariah was in his doubt, whether God really had heard my prayer,
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:02.440]   whether God would really give me a son, when he let that doubt pushes him to demand for
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.600]   certainty to say, "How can I be sure of this?
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.520]   How would I be certain of this?"
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.800]   When he demanded certainty from God, that's the moment that unbelief start to grow in
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.840]   his heart.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.440]   It's common as humans.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.000]   You want to ask God for signs.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.440]   "God, please give me a sign if you want me to do this or that."
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.840]   But the moment we see the sign, it's the moment it no longer requires faith inside
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.840]   of us.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.560]   You see, we run alpha here.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.160]   We just finished one and I love running alphas.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.200]   And one of my favorite session is actually the session that talks about prayer.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.440]   We'll tell people what is prayer, why do we pray, how do we pray, and then towards
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:45.000]   the end, we have small group discussion, and then towards the very, very end, we're supposed
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.160]   to introduce prayer to the entire group for the very first time.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.200]   And for some people, some of our guests who are not Christians yet, that could be the
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.240]   very first time in their life to pray.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.720]   You see, being a pastor for so many years, I'm an expert.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.880]   Okay, that's a confession.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.800]   I'm an expert to pray prayers that don't require faith.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.320]   It's my expertise to pray prayers that just, in my very words, I'm already comforting that
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   person.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.480]   Oh yeah, God, you know, Tim is not feeling well this week, but yeah, God, I know, you
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.680]   know, if we take enough rest, if we give ourselves time to heal and we will eventually be better.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:31.320]   So God, I just pray that you give the time and space for Tim to heal in Jesus' name.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.320]   Amen.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.600]   It's a prayer that is very pastoral, it's very comforting.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.920]   But honestly, I'm very honest, sometimes if I don't have faith, I pray that kind of prayer,
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.920]   it will not fail.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:49.000]   I'm just praying God, give him space and time to heal, not even asking God to heal him.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.880]   But in Alpha, in the first session, when I talk about prayer, this is my personal challenge.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.440]   When the first time I ran, I led a small group, it came to that moment, somebody said, "I
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.720]   just recently lost my job.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.720]   Can you pray for me?"
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.760]   I said, "Sure, let's just pray that God will give you a job."
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.440]   I don't know if God would do that.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.060]   I don't know, I can't promise, I can't guarantee that.
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.960]   But that's the moment when I pray that prayer, "God, please give him a job in Jesus' name,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   amen."
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.040]   That's a kind of prayer that requires faith.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:28.160]   In my uncertainty of whether God will act or not upon my prayer, that's where faith
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.160]   is activated.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:35.840]   That's why another Christian author, Philip Yancey, he puts it this way.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.300]   He said, "The opposite of faith is not doubt, but certainty."
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.820]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.700]   The opposite of faith is certainty.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:51.380]   Where there is certainty, there is no room for faith.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.640]   And here Luke showed us there is another way to respond in doubt.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:01.420]   When young Mary received a bizarre word from the angel, she also had her doubts, but she
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:07.180]   didn't reject God's word in her inability to understand, nor did she demand certainty
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.540]   in her confusion.
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.260]   She asked, "How will this be?
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.900]   How are you going to do this, God?"
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.460]   It was a question to explore the will of God in her life.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.780]   And as she began to understand a little bit more what God wants to do, and maybe perhaps
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:29.020]   how God would even do it in her life, there is faith arising in her heart, and she said
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.500]   this, "I am the Lord's servant.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.420]   May your word to me be fulfilled."
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.820]   Luke is showing us there is another way out to doubt.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.380]   There's another way out called faith.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.260]   Faith is not found where certainty could be found.
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.660]   It's a risk.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:58.540]   But then Luke also told us a very good news to all us doubters in this world.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.940]   If we don't have that kind of faith, if we're still doubting, this is a very comforting
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.940]   moment.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.820]   You see, God does not reject doubters.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.940]   Instead, He draws near to them.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:15.100]   People if you look at the Bible, people like Abraham, Moses, Peter, Job, they all have
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.600]   their doubts about God or His word.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.940]   If you read the psalm, you will see it is filled with prayers of doubt.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.080]   But God does not push doubters away.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.380]   He allows us to bring those questions to Him, and He doesn't want us simply to draw our
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.540]   own conclusion based on our experience and say, "You know, God is not going to help
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.540]   me.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.540]   He's not going to do anything."
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.540]   He doesn't want us to draw that conclusion ourselves.
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.180]   He doesn't want our hearts.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.260]   He doesn't want us to let unbelief to grow inside of our hearts.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:48.740]   But you need to see this even when there was a moment of doubt in Zechariah's life, his
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:54.140]   doubt didn't and never disqualified him from the blessing of God.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.980]   Even later, God gave him a sign to silence him, that he couldn't talk.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.980]   It was a sign for him to remember.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.260]   You know, when he finally sees his wife being pregnant and he wants to say something, he
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.260]   couldn't say it.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:16.380]   There he is reminded, no word from God's mouth will ever fail.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.620]   No words from God's mouth will ever fail.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:24.260]   It's the exact same words the angel Gabriel told Mary, but Zechariah got to experience
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.620]   it for himself.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:31.780]   And many years later, his son, John the Baptist, you know, he's the greatest Old Testament
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.780]   prophet.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:37.140]   He even saw Jesus prepare the way for Jesus' letter, spiritual revival in Israel.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:42.940]   He baptized Jesus, but later when he was caught and put into prison, he also had a moment
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:43.940]   of doubt.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.180]   The greatest prophet ever in the Old Testament, he has this moment of doubt.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.180]   So he sent his disciples to Jesus to ask this.
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:57.420]   He said, "Are you the one who is to come or should we expect someone else?"
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.940]   Jesus didn't give John a definitive answer.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.580]   He didn't offer certainty.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:08.420]   Instead Jesus invites John to see what he has done.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.420]   So Jesus replied to the messengers and said, "Go back and report to John what you have
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.500]   seen and heard.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:19.860]   The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear,
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:24.500]   the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor."
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:30.020]   So Jesus is inviting John to see what he has done and said, "You know what?
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:34.380]   If you put my eyes, if you put your eyes on what I've been doing in this world, if you
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.940]   put your eyes on me and not just on the things you're worried about that you doubt with,
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:43.140]   that you will have faith arise inside of your soul one more time."
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:48.940]   And today God also invites us to put our trust in him by opening our eyes and ears
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:54.460]   to see, to hear what he has done for us on the cross and also what he has been doing
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:34:02.460]   around us in our world so that faith could once again arise in us when we're struggling
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.800]   with doubt.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:11.240]   When I was 23, I was close to giving up.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:18.000]   I was this close to choose unbelief, to write off the idea that God has a calling in my
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.160]   life.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.280]   But I remember the Jesus who showed me his nail piece hands.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:30.660]   I remember how his love was flowing through my very veins in my body and out of nowhere
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:36.000]   that courage or whatever it is, I was just telling myself maybe or maybe this voice is
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.200]   telling me maybe I can give God one more chance or not.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.960]   I can ask God to give me one more chance.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.480]   I don't exactly know how it works.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.400]   I only know that I'm so broken.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   I'm done.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   I'm undone.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.400]   There's nothing left in me.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.440]   I couldn't be the one God has chosen.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:58.180]   I'm a very broken individual here but if God can still do something with my life, here
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.180]   I am God.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:04.260]   My life is in your hands.
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:10.700]   And so many years later, here standing in front of you all, it's a guy dropped out of
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:18.340]   school two times, got no certificate, no degree, no qualification whatsoever.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:23.540]   But God so graciously, he brought me through a journey where now after almost 20 years,
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:30.340]   I'm standing here doing the exact same thing that when I was 16, God has called me to do.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:35.580]   I get to, I get to join a ministry called Alpha and we film some cool videos to tell
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.340]   people about Jesus and about what he has done for us.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.620]   I get to join a beautiful community called The Vine where the senior pastor told me,
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.460]   Chapman, I see that you have struggled with God.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.540]   I see that you've wrestled with him.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:54.500]   You're walking, you're walking, you know, like this right now and we want people like
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.060]   you in The Vine.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:02.060]   We want to, we want you to join a community to walk alongside us and even come and work
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.900]   here.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:13.020]   Today if you find yourself in a position struggling with doubt, I want to tell you that you have
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.020]   a place in this community.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:23.260]   I found my place years ago when I was just a kid, dropped out from school.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:28.860]   I don't know what to do with my life, but I got accepted in a community like this.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:34.260]   I got to meet the grace and the love of God once again and he picked me up here.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.740]   And I believe he's going to do this.
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:40.940]   I believe with all my heart he's going to do this for every single one of us who need
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.940]   him to do that again.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:51.900]   And I just remember that, you know, if we're struggling with doubts about God in our life,
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.540]   he's not angry with us.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.700]   He's not rejecting us.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:01.020]   In fact, he is calling us once again onto a journey of faith.
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:05.660]   He accepts all the complaints, all the questions that we're throwing at him, but he said, I'm
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:10.600]   going to show you what I'm doing in your life or maybe in someone else's life around you.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.340]   And I want to invite you once again to put your trust in me.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:20.260]   I want to invite you onto a journey of faith where you have to walk by faith and not by
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.260]   sight.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:27.740]   And so I'm wondering if anybody here right now, the Holy Spirit is whispering into your
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.340]   ears.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.020]   Perhaps you, there were moments in your life you decided, okay, God, I'm done.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.140]   I've prayed enough times.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.500]   I'm not going to talk to you about this anymore.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:42.080]   If there's an area of unbelief in your life or maybe right here, right now, where you
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.440]   are, you're struggling with this doubt, you're asking God, I'm not sure if you've heard my
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.440]   prayer.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.440]   God, I'm not sure if you still love me.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.840]   God, I'm not sure if I'm still worthy.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.640]   I believe this is the moment God wants to speak to us today.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.520]   That's why we're going to enter into a moment of prayer and I'm going to invite the worship
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:04.880]   team back and we're just going to spend some time in the presence of the Holy Spirit today.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.240]   And we're just going to ask him to come.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   And I invite everyone to stand where you are.
