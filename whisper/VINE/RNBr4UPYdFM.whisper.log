[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   Thank you church, thank you worship team.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.480]   That was a beautiful time of singing
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.740]   and worshiping together.
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.600]   You may have a seat as you sit down.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.280]   There might be someone new next to you so you can say hi.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.400]   If you have some seats free next to you as well,
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.680]   just hold up your hand, let our host know
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.740]   so that we still have some people that are standing by
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.680]   wanting to get a seat.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.680]   So if there's a seat free next to you,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.980]   you can hold up your hand.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.740]   Our host will come and fill up as many people
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.880]   as we can in this room.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.360]   If you're in the overflow, a big welcome to you.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.480]   Thank you for being here with us.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.280]   And if you're joining us online,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.640]   a very good morning from Hong Kong.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.680]   Wherever you're joining us from, welcome as well.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.080]   So we've kicked off this sermon series
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.280]   that we've called Uncharted.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.080]   And actually I figured something out.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.240]   It's actually quite a good way to get away with stuff
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.440]   in the office these days, right?
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.480]   So for example, if you do something like,
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.600]   you know, go for a three hour lunch and you come back
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.960]   and Carla's like, where have you been?
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.120]   It's like, oh, on a lunch, it was three hours.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.680]   Well, it's Uncharted, right?
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.720]   I mean, we've never taken three hour lunches before,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.440]   but now it's the way we're gonna do things.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.100]   And so, just being cheeky, but you know,
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.960]   I figured it could be like a get out of jail free card
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.000]   sometimes as well.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.120]   But we are, we're in this new sermon series
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.800]   we've called Uncharted where we feel like God in this year
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.960]   has challenged us with a vision to go places
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.440]   we've never gone before, right?
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.400]   No strategy, no knowledge, no necessarily any plans
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.200]   or steps that we are intending to take,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.680]   but just be wide open in going where God
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.680]   is leading us to go.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.720]   But a lot of that has to do,
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.400]   starts with the way we think, right?
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.180]   We have to be thinking, right?
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.180]   We have to be thinking as God is thinking
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.520]   in order for go and do where he's called us to do
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280]   and go where he's called us to go.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.400]   And our thoughts are with us all the time.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.560]   You know, growing up, there's certain things
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.160]   I've realized now that have been so ingrained,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   like incepted into my mind that as I grew up as an adult,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.600]   you know, as you live life, you realize actually
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.480]   has a bigger impact on you than you first realize.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.920]   Right, some of these are funny and nonsensical, right?
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.760]   And you probably have heard some of these things.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.260]   For example, my mom and my grandma always told me
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.000]   that if you sleep with the fan on blowing in your face,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.860]   right, you will suffocate and die, okay?
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.520]   I'm sure I'm not the only one that's been
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.560]   grown up with that thought, right?
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.120]   If you don't sleep with the fan on,
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.600]   it's gonna blow against your nose
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.480]   and then the air, something happens, right?
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.360]   And then you will die in your sleep, okay?
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.600]   Another way, okay, another thing that my parents
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.640]   often told me was if you don't finish
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   every single grain of rice in your bowl, okay,
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.440]   that's gonna be a mark on your future wife's face, okay?
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.680]   Now my wife is sitting here right now,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.800]   you can see no marks on her face, very pretty, okay?
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.720]   But, right, so I would eat all my rice, right?
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.800]   So like you have to eat every single grain of rice, okay?
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.760]   And otherwise, you're gonna end up with,
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.160]   you know, a scarred-faced woman.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.160]   So, growing up, I was always very hot and very full, okay?
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.200]   Now I'm addicted to rice these days.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.280]   You can ask my friends, like,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.760]   if there's rice, I will always eat it.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.720]   Right, so there were some funny ways, okay?
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.920]   But some of these other thoughts
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.560]   that I feel like were imprinted into my mind
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.640]   were slightly more damaging, right?
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   For example, I developed a huge fear of making mistakes,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.120]   right, because making mistakes
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.400]   often led to harsh punishment from my mom.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.040]   And so instead of admitting to mistakes,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.200]   I would hide, I would lie to cover things up.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.040]   But of course, as you know, the more you hide,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.480]   the more you lie, the bigger trouble I would get in
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.520]   in the end, and the more punished I would be, right?
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.040]   And I realized this started to affect
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.240]   the way I express myself, right?
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.920]   I began to believe that, you know,
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.640]   actually, I can't make any mistakes at all,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.680]   so I have to keep everything hidden inside, right?
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.600]   I might feel this way, but I'm not gonna say it, right?
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.680]   'Cause I might be wrong, and if I'm wrong,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.760]   then I'm gonna be punished.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.440]   Now I used to think everybody thought like this.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.320]   This was just a normal way to function in life, right?
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.640]   Until after I got married, I realized,
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.280]   actually, I should say it was pointed out to me, okay,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.040]   that this pattern of thought was deeply affecting me, right?
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.560]   Because 100% it affected the way I was communicating
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   with Brittany and the quality of our marriage.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.840]   Now I will also say this, right?
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.080]   I love my mom deeply, and over the years,
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.960]   she and I have had some, started to have some
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.160]   really beautiful but hard conversations
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.440]   about the way she raised me, right?
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.800]   These healing and forgiving sort of conversations
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.200]   about my childhood and her childhood,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.960]   and as we talked, I began to realize
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.000]   that the reason why fear was such a big part
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.160]   of my upbringing was because she was also raised
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.000]   in an environment where fear was even more,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.920]   you know, deeply saturated into a background
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.880]   and punishment from my grandparents to her and her siblings.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.600]   And so through a little bit of counseling
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.160]   to try and help me out, right,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.400]   Brittany and I, I tried to express myself
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.320]   as best as I can these days.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.880]   I tried to be intentional, not to let my own
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.280]   negative experiences now also shape the way
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.000]   I parent my two boys.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.640]   But what I've come to realize is that
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.920]   for things to really change, I really have to go back
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.880]   to the source, right, and change the way I think.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.600]   Right, I have to tell myself, remind myself
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.120]   literally these days that it's okay to make mistakes,
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.560]   right, no one's gonna come at me with a feather duster
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.600]   for the bad thing that I did, all right?
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.840]   Now, this is just a personal example,
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.120]   but the point I'm trying to make is this, right?
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.400]   It's not very hard to see that our thinking patterns
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.800]   have a significant effect on our beliefs
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.560]   and how we live our life and our behaviors,
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.360]   right, which is why with this vision
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.000]   that the Lord has given us to embrace the uncharted,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.520]   to go forth into territory that we've never been before,
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.880]   we have to be open-minded.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.440]   And if God wants to change the way we think,
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.400]   we have to let the Holy Spirit challenge us
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.880]   in our beliefs and challenge us in our behaviors
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.360]   and challenge us in our traditions
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.280]   to go where God wants us to go, right?
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.680]   We sang this just now, shake up the ground
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.840]   of my traditions, bring down the walls of my religion.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.520]   Now, again, don't get me wrong, right?
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.400]   I'm not saying all religions and traditions are bad, right?
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.000]   There are lots of tenets of truth and traditions
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.120]   that play an important role in our faith, right?
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.280]   There's certain tenets and pillars of the Christian faith
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.320]   that I would say are definitely true
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.240]   and unshakeable and unmovable,
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.560]   and anyone who tells you anything else, it's a liar, right?
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.880]   For example, Jesus is the only way,
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.480]   the truth and the life, right?
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.280]   That cannot be changed, okay?
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.240]   That there is one God who exists as the Father and Son
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.640]   of the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.800]   You will never change, that is just a fact, okay?
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.200]   That Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.000]   died on the cross as a perfect sacrifice for our sins,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.640]   was resurrected on the third day,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.560]   and sits enthroned in heaven.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.640]   He's coming back to restore his creation
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.480]   and judge the living and the dead, okay?
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.400]   That is a fact that you can never change.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.720]   We have God's word, these 66 books
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.960]   that God has given us as holy scripture.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.040]   The words of this book will never change.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.120]   No one can ever add or take away from this book.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.520]   We have beautiful traditions like communion,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.440]   which we celebrate every month, right?
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.480]   Some churches celebrate even more, right?
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.280]   It's a reminder of God's love and sacrifice
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.680]   and his presence with us.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.640]   We have baptism, where we publicly display
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   our faith in Jesus.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.040]   These are some traditions and things,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.320]   part of our faith, that are unshakable, unmovable.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.440]   On the other hand, though, we have to be careful
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.640]   not to let other things bind us so much
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.400]   that the new and fresh things that God wants us to do
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.640]   are hindered by these barriers that we put up in our lives.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.600]   And unless we're willing to embrace God's way of thinking,
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.160]   we will never be like I've been saying,
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.840]   go where God is leading us to go
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.000]   and do what he's asking us to do.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.120]   So the question we have to ask ourselves today
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.560]   is this, church.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.520]   Are we open to changing our thinking?
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.040]   Are we open to changing our traditions
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.600]   whenever God challenges them?
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.560]   Now, this is a huge challenge,
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.480]   because most of us are comfortable with the way we think.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.520]   Most of all, are comfortable with,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.760]   we think we're right all the time.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.200]   For example, after I got married,
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.480]   did you realize that there is a correct way?
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.600]   I didn't think there was a correct way
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.640]   to put milk in the fridge, but apparently there is.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.520]   I didn't think there was a correct way to fold towels
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.160]   that stack up in the bathroom a certain way,
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.240]   but there is, guys.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   But we develop these mindsets, right?
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.400]   We get so ingrained in these traditions,
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.520]   we get rooted into habits, we become stubborn,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.960]   and that becomes hard to change.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.120]   Especially, maybe some of these things
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.920]   have offered us comfort and guidance in the past.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.760]   We wanna hold onto them so that we feel protected
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.160]   as we go into the future.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.120]   But we've been saying, as we go into the future,
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.000]   we don't know what's going on.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.320]   We don't know where God is leading us to go.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.480]   So if we hold onto those things,
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.360]   we don't know if they're actually gonna be useful or not.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.000]   Today, we're looking at a passage in scripture.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.480]   And through looking at this story,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.000]   I hope we can see that God,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.440]   we realize that God is a God who's not afraid
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.040]   to challenge the way we think,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.560]   to help us to break free from the things that hold us back,
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.680]   even if some of those things
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.240]   might have been good at one stage.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   If it's not fit for purpose now,
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.040]   God is challenging us to change the way we think
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.560]   so we can be the people he's called us to be.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.200]   So let's open up God's word.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.840]   You can listen to me, or you can read on the screen,
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.240]   or if you have your Bible, open that up.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.040]   Acts chapter 10 is where we're gonna be.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.880]   At Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.560]   a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.640]   He and all his family were devout and God-fearing.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.720]   He gave generously to those in need
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.440]   and prayed to God regularly.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.560]   One day, at about three in the afternoon, he had a vision.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.960]   He distinctly saw an angel of God who came to him
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.720]   and said, "Cornelius!"
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.660]   Cornelius stared at him in fear.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.740]   "What is it, Lord?" he asked.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.800]   The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.960]   "have come up as a memorial offering before God.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.860]   "Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.420]   "who is called Peter.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.500]   "He is staying with Simon the Tanner
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.920]   "whose house is by the sea."
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.280]   Now right away, I think what Luke's trying to do
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.920]   is get us to shift and change.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.800]   He's challenging us to look at certain things
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.420]   with a different perspective.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.240]   Let me explain what I mean.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.440]   At this time, Israel was still under Roman rule
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.960]   and authority.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.600]   One of the things that Romans were most proud of,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.280]   they were ruling over Israel at the time,
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.920]   they were the main authority,
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.980]   and one of the things that they were most proud of
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.480]   was their strong military power, their army.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.500]   Now Cornelius was a big part of that army,
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.880]   a centurion in a very important city.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.200]   So as a man, as a centurion in a place like Caesarea
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.000]   with an important port city,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.280]   he had a good amount of influence,
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.920]   a powerful leader, and centurion means he had 100 soldiers
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.960]   under his control.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.660]   And so we would expect him to fit the stereotypes
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.600]   of a Roman officer.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.520]   And what were those?
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.040]   Well, they were known as being brutish and cruel,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.440]   people who wouldn't hesitate to throw you in prison
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.720]   at the drop of a hat, to have you tortured,
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.080]   or even to have you killed if they didn't like
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.240]   the way you were doing something.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.780]   As Romans, they would have worshipped pagan gods,
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.100]   other gods, not Yahweh, but their own gods
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.800]   and their own religion.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.120]   So that would be the way that people would think about
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.000]   a Roman soldier or a centurion,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.960]   someone in authority who is part of the Roman Empire.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.440]   But this isn't what Cornelius is like at all.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.280]   Instead, we are told that he is a God-fearing man,
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.880]   devout, he's generous to the poor,
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.560]   and very strikingly, they say he is a man of prayer.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.240]   He prays to God.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.020]   So what Luke is trying to do through this story
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.940]   is to help us open our eyes
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.460]   and open up our thinking a little bit.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.500]   Because it would be easy to have written Cornelius off
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.100]   and say to ourselves, there is no way a man could ever use,
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.580]   a God could ever use a man like that.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.300]   A Roman soldier, an idol worshipper,
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.540]   he's cruel, he's unsympathetic.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.500]   But what God is trying to say,
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.100]   I can use anybody I choose to use.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.180]   One thing to remember is this,
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.360]   we are not told how Cornelius actually came
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.080]   to know who God was, and to be so generous,
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.920]   to be so devoted to prayer.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.800]   I don't think it would be too much of a reach, though,
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.340]   to sort of think that actually,
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.600]   Cornelius, too, had to go through a process
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.540]   of changing his mind.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.640]   Knowing his background, knowing the way he was raised,
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.080]   he was probably raised in a home
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.740]   that did not worship God, that was cruel, that was brutish,
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.280]   embracing all those stereotypes that he grew up with.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.260]   At some point, he had to change his mind,
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.860]   saying, I'm not gonna be like that,
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.020]   I'm not gonna be cruel, I'm not gonna be mean to people,
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.340]   actually, I'm gonna be generous, I'm gonna pray to God.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.140]   He had a fundamental shift in the way he thought
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.900]   and in his beliefs.
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.460]   He had to make the big decision of pledging himself,
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.500]   not to Caesar, right, that's how the Romans were prayed to,
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.300]   pray to Caesar, but to pray to Yahweh instead.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.120]   You see, what God was doing,
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.000]   God had amazing plans for Cornelius.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.640]   There was something he was trying to do through Cornelius,
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.560]   but first, he had to challenge Cornelius
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.480]   in his way of thinking.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.320]   Now, as I was reading this,
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.600]   I felt like this was a word in season for us,
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.920]   in the way we look at our leaders here in Hong Kong.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.920]   Hear me out.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.520]   Over the past few years, it's no secret
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.700]   that we have struggled at times.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.300]   There's been a struggle between the city's leaders
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.300]   and the citizens.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.020]   And perhaps certain decisions that have been made,
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.780]   it's easy to look at those in governing powers over us,
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.300]   to look at authority figures
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.020]   and think of them negatively, straight away,
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.860]   believing that they're all unkind,
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.940]   that they do not care about their citizens,
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.780]   that they're their own agenda in mind.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.620]   But actually, I would say
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.900]   this is probably not just a Hong Kong problem,
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.940]   but all over the world, it's easy for us now
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.580]   to look at our earthly authority figures,
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.500]   people in government, people in authority over us,
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.140]   through a lens of disdain,
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.820]   much like a first-century Jew
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.660]   might have looked at a Roman soldier, an officer,
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.180]   seeing them as cruel, barbaric, and unsympathetic.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.780]   And because we think these things about them,
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.580]   we feel like we can't trust them,
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.220]   and we feel like we don't want to follow them.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.460]   We think they're cruel and unkind.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.900]   We don't want anything to do with them.
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.780]   But I felt like when I was reading this,
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.140]   God was challenging us to shift our perspective,
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.140]   especially to those who govern over us.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.540]   Because what if, and not even what if,
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.300]   I believe, actually, that God is calling us
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.300]   to truly pray for those in authority over us.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.140]   And for some of us,
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.580]   this is gonna take a big shift in our thinking,
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.740]   and a big shift in the way we believe things.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.980]   But I think this, because as we pray for our leaders,
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.380]   as God has commanded us to do in Scripture,
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.580]   perhaps God is also, at the same time,
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.620]   doing the work of raising up leaders,
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.020]   people in authority, authority figures,
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.460]   changing their hearts, changing their minds,
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.140]   like he might have done with Cornelius,
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.100]   who will then go on to live, to govern,
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.500]   to serve society in the way
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.860]   that God has called them to serve.
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.940]   And then we'll start to see the change
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.460]   that we've been all hoping to see.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.220]   You see what I'm trying to say?
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.060]   So church, are we willing
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.460]   to change the way we think about leaders
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.860]   and those in authority over us?
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.460]   Are we willing to think and break out of those peoples
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.340]   that we've stereotyped as certain things,
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.780]   so that we can join in with God
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.140]   and want the best for their lives, and pray for them,
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.220]   and as God changes and moves people
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.900]   in ways that we don't even understand how,
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.740]   we get to partner with God in shaping
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.060]   and providing hope for this world.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:53.300]   So with this new way of thinking,
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.340]   Cornelius, like we say, he suddenly and immediately,
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.100]   Cornelius suddenly receives a message from God,
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.420]   and immediately, he responds obediently
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.620]   to this mysterious message.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:09.340]   Go to Joppa, find Peter, bring him back to me.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.140]   And Cornelius responds immediately in obedience.
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.340]   It says this, "Cornelius called two of his servants
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.300]   "and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants."
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.900]   So three dudes, he says, he told them everything
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.460]   that happened and sent them to Joppa.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.420]   Now at this moment, you have to realize,
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.500]   Cornelius has no clue what was going on.
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.540]   He's received a vision, an angel has come to talk to him.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.340]   He's wondering, what is this all about?
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.940]   Who is this Simon Peter guy?
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.380]   Why is he at Simon the Tender's house?
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.140]   Why is the name Simon so popular in this area?
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.020]   Why does God want him to bring me back here?
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.980]   There's no answers yet,
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.820]   but what we can see is faith and obedience.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.660]   And as God shifts our thinking,
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.500]   we also have to ask ourselves these questions.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.820]   Once he does that, are we willing to be obedient
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.740]   even when things aren't clear for us?
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.500]   Are we willing to do what God calls us to do
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.060]   even when we haven't seen the whole picture yet?
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.980]   Andrew talked a bit about this last week,
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.500]   but obedience is easy when we understand.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:23.060]   True obedience though, is when we don't see it all,
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.340]   yet we are still willing to do it anyway.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.380]   This is what it means to take a risk,
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.700]   to not rely on a strategy, to have total surrender to God,
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.580]   but it has to start with the way we think,
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.460]   because most of us like a plan of action,
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.940]   even myself, right, most of the time I'm flying
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.140]   by the seats of my pants, right, whatever you say,
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.980]   but, okay, even for myself,
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.340]   at least some guardrails are comforting sometimes.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.620]   But are we willing, right, to break of our comfort zones
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.060]   of knowing every single step
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.860]   and to simply let God lead the way and have his way?
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.780]   And when we do this, church,
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.700]   we see amazing things begin to happen.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.100]   Okay, check it out, this is what happens next.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.540]   About noon the following day,
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.580]   they were on their journey and approaching the city.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.780]   Peter went up on the roof to pray.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.100]   He became hungry and wanted something to eat,
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.860]   and while the meal was still being prepared,
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.460]   he fell into a trance.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.220]   He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheep
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.340]   being let down to earth by its four corners.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.940]   It contained all kinds of four-footed animals
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.900]   as well as reptiles and birds.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:41.980]   And a voice told him, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat."
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.860]   "Surely not, Lord," Peter replied.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:49.500]   "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.000]   The voice spoke to him a second time,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.340]   "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.460]   This happened three times,
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.180]   and immediately the sheep was taken back to heaven.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.540]   So the story is beginning to emerge.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.060]   Now it's Peter's turn to have a supernatural encounter,
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.380]   to have a vision from heaven.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.220]   And in his vision, we see something like a sheet
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.380]   that's filled with all kinds of animals,
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.340]   and he's commanded to get up, kill, and eat.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.220]   Now, in our Chinese context, this sounds like a jackpot.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.220]   Good punchoi, this is like a buffet.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.280]   As a Chinese person, it's kind of hard sometimes
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.020]   to imagine things we can and cannot eat.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.700]   So if we were to see a vision like this,
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.700]   God says, "Come on, kill and eat."
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.560]   It's like an invitation to a buffet.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.500]   "Let's do it, come on, I'm excited.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.540]   "I can eat anything I want."
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.060]   That's like the best deal ever.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.780]   But Peter is not excited.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.400]   He doesn't wanna go anywhere near that stuff.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.820]   In fact, he almost sounds insulted
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.940]   that Jesus would ask him to do such a thing
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.980]   in the first place.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.440]   Jesus was asking Peter, essentially,
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.920]   to break the food laws.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.000]   All kinds of unclean animals that Jews were forbidden
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.800]   to eat were filled up in this sheet.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.520]   Peter's like, "I've never touched those things.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.000]   "From since I was a baby, I've been observing these laws.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.480]   "These laws that have been passed down
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.000]   "from generation to generation,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.500]   "since we've been freed from slavery in Egypt up till now.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.440]   "My parents, my grandparents, my great-grandparents,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.160]   "we have all followed these laws.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.800]   "Things have always been this way."
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.320]   Which is why Peter says, "Surely not, Lord.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.500]   "I have never eaten anything unclean."
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.560]   And you have to realize that actually,
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.440]   this wasn't just about food laws.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.880]   This was about identity.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.720]   It was a matter of holiness.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.280]   The food laws were part of the laws
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.280]   that set the nation of Israel apart from other nations.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.880]   From Jews, from Gentiles.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.440]   Gentiles means anyone who's not a Jew.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.200]   So this is what it did for them,
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   to set them apart, to keep them holy,
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   to keep them protected from other nations.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.680]   And Jews would look at all these unclean foods
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.560]   that the Gentiles would eat and would label them
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.400]   as evil and wicked for these unclean things
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.520]   that Gentiles would do.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.920]   Us as Jewish people, we don't do those things.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.000]   And so when Peter says, "No, I'm not gonna do that,"
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.500]   you can sort of sympathize him a little bit at first
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.980]   to why he had that sort of reaction.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.840]   Like I said, his whole life,
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.500]   this was ingrained to his beliefs,
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.880]   the importance of keeping up Levitical law,
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.840]   certain rules, certain things, right?
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.360]   And it wasn't just food laws as a whole,
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   but 617 laws that they had to follow.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.160]   It was part of their identity.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.120]   Right, in fact, the food laws were particularly important
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.580]   that they were revered in a way
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.520]   some of the heroes of the Old Testament faith.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.720]   Remember David and his three friends, right?
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.480]   They refused to eat the king's food.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.200]   And in the end, they were commended
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.240]   as people who truly follow God
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.600]   and God blessed them in a certain way.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.080]   They were rescued by God
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.080]   precisely because they didn't break the food laws.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.040]   So Peter was thinking this, I'm set.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.000]   These are things that can never be done.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.120]   Certain foods are prohibited by God.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.120]   I'm never gonna break that law.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.800]   And for a time, like I said,
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   that was needed and it was right.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.080]   But now what God was doing through this vision, right,
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.840]   even though Peter doesn't quite see it yet,
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.640]   he makes clear that there is now no distinction
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.000]   between Jews and Gentiles.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.960]   God is using this picture of unclean food now made clean
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.920]   to pertain that the Gentiles too
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.960]   are included in God's plan.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.280]   They've always been, right?
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.520]   That they're included in God's plan,
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.600]   that the Gentiles have been made clean.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   And so what this means now is for you yourself, Peter,
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.680]   as a Jewish person, you can now go and fellowship
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.280]   and do life and minister to these people.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   In fact, that's what I'm gonna call you to do.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.520]   I am welcoming them fully into this family of God, Peter,
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.160]   and so should you.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.440]   So Peter, put out your old way of thinking
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.160]   and be a part of what I'm trying to do now.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.880]   This is what God is trying to say.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.280]   In fact, he says it very clearly.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:28.280]   Do not call anything impure that God has made unclean.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.040]   Like I said, it's more than just about food laws.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.000]   It's not just saying to Peter,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   hey, go and eat taffy right now, okay?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.720]   It's more than that.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.240]   One level, yes, dig in, but like I said,
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.880]   he's trying to say there are no lines of boundaries now
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.120]   that one separates it from you and the others.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.560]   Jesus is drawing Jew and Gentile together,
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.960]   not moving past one to get to the other,
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.240]   not choosing one and rejecting the other,
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.000]   but bringing them together to draw close
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.320]   what was once far apart.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.640]   When I was studying this, I may think, what about us?
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.920]   What are some ways in our society
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.680]   and these traditional ways of thinking
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.640]   that we have labeled other people as unclean
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.480]   and rejected them?
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.200]   What are some lines and boundaries within our own culture
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.880]   that we need to begin and start changing our thinking on?
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.080]   In many ways, what God was challenging Peter to do,
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.960]   similar what we're facing in Hong Kong today.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.280]   Like Peter, for those of us who grew up in Hong Kong,
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.920]   we've grown up in sort of like a colonized environment,
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.680]   meaning we've always been under the rule
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.800]   of some sort of foreign power.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.440]   But now that we're no longer accordingly,
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.960]   we've returned to our home country for some time now,
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.160]   but because we've been separated for so long,
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.680]   we don't really feel that connected as Hong Kongers
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.360]   to our roots and our origins.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.760]   So we find ourselves, I feel like,
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.080]   in a bit of an identity crisis.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.640]   We're not British enough to be British,
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.960]   we're not Chinese enough to be Chinese,
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.120]   so we have Hong Kong culture.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.560]   And so as Hong Kongers, we're proud of this in many ways.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.720]   I am so proud to be from this city,
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.480]   and it's such a beautiful thing.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:16.120]   We have a rich diversity here in Hong Kong, don't we?
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.600]   Melting pot from people from all over the world.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.880]   We can even see that reflected in this very room itself.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.400]   We've got Cantonese language,
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.800]   colorful, very descriptive, right?
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.760]   You could ask for a spoon and end up with a fork, right?
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.160]   Get one tone wrong,
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.920]   and it completely changes what you're trying to say.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.960]   We have amazing food, right?
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.080]   Vibrant, delicious, fusion foods from all over the world.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.400]   You can have an amazing meal for $45,
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.640]   or you can have an even better,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.400]   you can have a good meal for $4,500, right?
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.080]   Either one, it's amazing and delicious, it's in own way.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.320]   At the same time though,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.600]   because I feel like we have these struggles with identity,
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.040]   we've developed these sort of defense mechanisms,
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.880]   these barriers, these ways of thinking that we've put up
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.280]   that separate us from others.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.720]   And these have developed into some unhealthy
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.760]   and prejudiced ways of thinking
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.520]   that we might view people in our city.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.920]   So for example, when we encounter someone from the mainland,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.160]   as a Hong Konger, maybe one of our natural instincts
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.000]   is to think, "Oh, well, they're not really like us.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.200]   "We might look similar,
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.080]   "but they don't really share in our culture.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.280]   "They don't really, you know, we speak a similar language,
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.720]   "but it's quite different enough for us
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.560]   "not to be able to understand each other,
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.080]   "so we're not gonna engage with them."
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.600]   What about our foreign domestic workers?
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.480]   Well, these people might live alongside us,
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.080]   but really they're just a worker in our homes.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.280]   We're the busy, successful Hong Kongers
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.960]   going about making money.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.000]   We don't need to really engage with them.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.480]   And sometimes we don't even think of them
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.280]   and treat of them as members of society, right?
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.680]   Since the pattern of thinking we've developed,
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.320]   their role is just to serve.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.600]   And we fail to truly love, respect, and honor
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.880]   our foreign domestic workers, our helpers, and aunties
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.600]   who support our families so well.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.200]   What about our other ethnic minorities
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.440]   that live in this city, right?
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.120]   They too eat differently, dress differently,
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.600]   have languages that we don't understand.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.960]   Again, but they haven't grown up here.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.360]   They're not really Hong Kongers,
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.240]   so let's keep them at arm's length as well.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.960]   Now, we're in Hong Kong.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.800]   I'm a Hong Konger.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.640]   We're speaking in a very Hong Kong context,
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.240]   but if you're listening today and you're not from here,
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.640]   or you're listening from somewhere else,
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.680]   the idea is the same, right?
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.360]   You see what I'm trying to say?
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.640]   In your own context, in your own culture,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.000]   what are these barriers that you've set up?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.760]   What are these faulty ways of thinking
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.160]   that you've developed about other people,
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   other cultures that are not like you?
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.960]   Or what about when it comes to even in this gathering,
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.000]   our own church itself, right?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.080]   Do we label people with certain sin struggles
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.760]   to be more unclean?
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.040]   Do we take a holier-than-thou approach
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.400]   to people struggling with certain sins?
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.160]   Do the barriers that we see in culture
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.560]   seep into our faith gatherings?
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.200]   So on the surface here, it might seem like
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.680]   everyone's getting along, raising their hands in worship,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.920]   getting along, praising God together,
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.320]   but deep down, I would never go to this person's house.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.160]   No way.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.520]   That true connection is not there.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.040]   These barriers break God's heart.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.560]   It's certainly not how he thinks about things.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.680]   And as we hold on to these old ways of thinking,
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.440]   we hold on to our prejudice,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.320]   we are calling impure by our own judgment
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.480]   what God has already made clean.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.480]   What are we refusing to change, church,
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.360]   but we know God has deep down,
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.120]   we know that God has called us to change.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.120]   These are the ways of thinking
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.880]   that God is challenging us in.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.920]   And it's a beautiful thing
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.760]   when Peter realizes what's happening.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.840]   When Peter realizes what Jesus is asking him to do,
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.520]   it's like a eureka, ding, ding, ding sort of moment
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.360]   in his life, right?
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.880]   Listen to these words.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.400]   I now realize how true it is
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.880]   that God chose not favoritism, listen,
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.320]   but accepts every nation who fears him
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.440]   and does what is right.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.680]   You have to understand Peter's mindset from before.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.400]   He became a man from so adamant, right,
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.160]   about not ever, he's a very stubborn man
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.560]   to changing his thinking
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.360]   into what God has been asking him to embrace.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.320]   This is the beautiful thing
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.920]   about letting God do the thinking instead of us,
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.840]   because he's infinitely wiser,
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.840]   his perspective is infinitely wider than any of us.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.000]   We find out, actually,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.240]   this is what God has been working at the whole time,
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.960]   even though we don't know it.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.920]   It took them to respond in change of thinking
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.760]   and their obedience.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.920]   Now they see it, right?
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.320]   Last week, we realized that Peter and the Ethiopian eunuch
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.960]   were, it wasn't a coincidence that they got together,
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.480]   but it was the Holy Spirit who was orchestrating.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.800]   God was orchestrating the whole thing, right?
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.000]   Later on in the story of Acts,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.440]   we have Saul and Ananias,
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.800]   two people that should never have been together,
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.920]   but God brings them together.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.000]   And now we have Cornelius and Peter,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.280]   two men who are willing to change the way they think,
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.440]   respond in obedience to God,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.160]   and now God's gonna use them in a remarkable way.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.720]   Like I said, the transformation that Peter has gone through
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.760]   is actually pretty remarkable, right?
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.000]   'Cause Peter was always a person who thought he knew best.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.240]   Last week, we figured out, right,
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.080]   Peter was the one who thought he knew better than Jesus,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.160]   that planned for Jesus' life
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.320]   until Jesus rebuked him to his face.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.480]   Peter was once, he thought that violence was the best way
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.280]   to stop the soldiers from worshiping Jesus.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.120]   So what did he do?
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.280]   He took things into his own hand.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.760]   When the soldiers were coming to arrest Jesus,
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.400]   he pulls out his sword, tries to cut the guy's head off,
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.520]   and said, "Just get his ear," right?
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.800]   He thought that was the right thing to do.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.280]   But God told Jesus, says, "Not this way, Peter."
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.960]   Peter was so stubborn in his thinking,
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.800]   "I'm gonna be loyal to Jesus,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.040]   "and even if it costs me my life,
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.200]   "only to deny his best friend hours after that."
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.320]   So Peter has gone through this journey
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.760]   in the way he was thinking,
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.320]   but there's one particular moment,
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:46.040]   as I was reading this passage and thinking back,
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   that I felt like Peter was probably thinking about
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.440]   when he came across this thought.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.960]   Matthew 16, 19 tells us,
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.080]   when Jesus is having this conversation with Peter,
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.520]   he once said to Peter,
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:01.320]   "The keys to the kingdom of heaven have been given to you."
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.400]   And I really wonder if Peter was thinking
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.160]   about that conversation when he realized
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.280]   that's what's happening in this moment.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.440]   It's God was saying, "Remember, Peter,
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.200]   "I gave you the keys.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   "You are the gatekeeper in this moment
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.600]   "of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.240]   "I want you to take those keys, Peter.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.040]   "I want you to open the gates and throw them wide open,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.800]   "and now your job is to tell the whole world,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.000]   "everyone who loves me is welcome in.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.120]   "Doesn't matter if you're Jew,
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.640]   "doesn't matter if you're Gentile.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.760]   "Open those gates, Peter.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.720]   "You have the key.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.200]   "Your job is to tell the world who I am
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.760]   "and let everybody into my kingdom.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.800]   "This is the new way of thinking
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.720]   "that I'm challenging you with,
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.560]   "not just to the Jewish nation, but to everyone."
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.120]   And this is what Peter's life changed.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.320]   We see him launching into this mission,
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.920]   and he goes and he starts spreading the gospel.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.600]   He starts with Cornelius and his family.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   He starts sharing with them the gospel,
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.240]   telling them who Jesus is.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.680]   Even though they love God, they haven't yet met Jesus,
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.160]   and so in this moment, Peter shares the gospel
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.400]   with Cornelius, his family.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.840]   He starts to tell them about his death and his resurrection,
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.200]   the forgiveness of sins that come through believing in him.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.880]   And Peter has fully embraced his thinking
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.200]   that everyone who gives their life to Jesus
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.240]   is welcome into his kingdom.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.480]   All the barriers now, the very fact that he's in Cornelius'
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.520]   house itself already means that his thinking
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.040]   has been changed.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.640]   But this is the most amazing thing.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.240]   An astonishing thing happens here.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.680]   Peter didn't even get to finish his message
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:40.800]   because at that moment, the Holy Spirit falls,
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.320]   and Cornelius and his family begin speaking his tongues
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.760]   and they're baptized fully into God's family.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.560]   But we saw this happening earlier, actually,
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.720]   in the book of Acts, on the day of Pentecost,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.080]   when the disciples themselves were filled
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.600]   with the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.680]   Now it's the Gentiles' turn, the non-Jewish family's turn,
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.240]   to receive the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.160]   This is God's final confirmation of the picture.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.120]   This is truly what I'm trying to do.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.480]   Everyone now is welcome into the kingdom of God.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.800]   This is for real.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:20.080]   All this was possible because Peter was willing
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.120]   to think differently.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.600]   He was willing to put down his traditions,
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.320]   his culture, so he could respond to what God
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.440]   was calling him to do.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.560]   Right, he could have been stubborn,
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.600]   he could have been stuck in his ways
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.840]   when he saw that sheet and he said,
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.960]   "I'm not gonna do that, I'm gonna keep to my lane,
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.960]   "I'm gonna stay what I'm doing.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.080]   "You go find someone else to do this."
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.400]   But notice, that's not what happens.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   He responds by changing his thinking in obedience to God.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.360]   Right, notice, this is always about God's work.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.000]   It's not that Peter changed his thoughts
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   in somehow orchestrated events, right?
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.240]   It's not that he saw, it wasn't just a random vision
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.680]   in the sky that he responded to it.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.720]   This was God challenging him to his way of thinking
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.680]   into ways he'd never thought about himself,
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.200]   but responding in obedience to what God
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.120]   was calling him to do now.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.800]   And as we look, this is very typical
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.280]   of the way God works across the Bible.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.360]   Right, helping people change their perspective,
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.600]   change their thinking so he can respond
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.440]   in obedience to him and then they can do
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.360]   what he's called them to do.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.120]   For example, Moses.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.120]   Right, Moses always thought he wasn't a good speaker.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.240]   I'm not, I don't have the words,
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.120]   I'm not a good speaker, Lord.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.000]   But God used him to speak to Pharaoh
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.160]   and set his people free from slavery.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.520]   Gideon thought to himself, I'm the smallest dude
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.640]   from the smallest tribe, there's big army before me,
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.080]   how can I ever do, how can I ever defeat them?
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.560]   God shifts his perspective, changes thinking,
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:58.120]   and with just 300 men, Gideon defeats the enemy army.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.960]   Right, the woman at the well thought, you know,
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.880]   Jesus was there to condemn her, just like everybody else.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.480]   She thought, you know, I'm no longer worthy of society,
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.600]   I have to come out here in the heat of the day
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.760]   just to get some water, I have no place in society anymore.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.440]   But as she encounters Jesus, her perspective changes
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.880]   and she goes back and evangelizes
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.800]   the entire region of Samaria.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.480]   You see how now it's not our role to think up strategies,
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.520]   to come up with ideas, to come up with plans,
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.840]   to figure things out, God has already done that for us.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.680]   All he asks us to do is shift the way we think
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.160]   so that we can walk in obedience
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.560]   and then he can use us to do the things
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.400]   that he has called us to do.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.800]   It's all about being obedient to Christ.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.000]   So let me give us a few guidelines from scripture
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.160]   as to how we can switch our minds
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.040]   so we can be more obedient to the things
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.160]   God is calling us to.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.840]   Number one, 1 Corinthians 2, 16,
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.720]   scripture tells us to do this,
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.680]   to put on the mind of Christ.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.440]   This means that we don't think like the world thinks,
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.360]   but rather we put on the mind of Christ,
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.880]   we're saying that we think like Jesus would think.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.160]   We approach things from a godly perspective.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.160]   We set our minds on the things that are what?
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.760]   Above.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.560]   And as we do this, scripture tells us
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.720]   we can't do this by our own experience.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.440]   We lean not on our own, what church?
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.480]   Understanding.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:36.120]   But submit all our ways to him, that's Proverbs 3.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.240]   We embrace the wisdom of God,
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.680]   we trust that God's way are not our ways,
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.800]   his thoughts are what?
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.960]   Higher than our thoughts, Isaiah 55.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.200]   You see, if we do things,
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.880]   if we keep just thinking in our own ways
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.360]   and doing things our own ways,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.960]   we're only ever gonna get earthly results.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.400]   But when we shift our thinking
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.240]   and respond in obedience to God,
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   we get godly, heavenly, supernatural results.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:08.160]   We do not conform to the pattern of this world
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.520]   that Bible tells us,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.120]   but our minds are transformed,
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.800]   we are transformed by the renewing of our minds.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.840]   Then we will be able to test and approve what God's will is,
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.040]   his good, pleasing, and perfect will, right?
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.920]   To obey him, to walk in the way he wants us to walk,
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.440]   Romans 12.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.760]   We take every top captive and make it what?
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.160]   Obedient to Christ.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.920]   This is what I mean when we say
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.960]   we need to change the way we think, right?
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.240]   It's not about mustering up more willpower,
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.240]   it's not about manifesting, okay?
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.280]   Don't come at me with that.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.440]   Okay, into reality.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.160]   It's not about setting a more positive mindset even,
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.200]   it's about changing your thinking
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.160]   so you can be obedient to God
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.040]   and walk in the way that he's called you to walk.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.000]   This is what it means to change our thinking.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.560]   And when we do this,
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:06.280]   when we do this, the world truly begins to change.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.680]   When we have a church that's filled with people
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.360]   who are thinking right, guided by God's wisdom,
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.800]   obedient to what Jesus has called us to do,
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.840]   empowered by the Holy Spirit,
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.520]   boldly going into these uncharted areas
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.960]   that we've been challenged to go,
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.520]   to places in our community,
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.600]   we bring down the strongholds
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.880]   that have been taking other people captive.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.480]   We can say amen to that, yes?
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.680]   Imagine what it would be like.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.920]   Our city is so stuck in the ways of thinking,
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.160]   some of the things that we see in our society
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.320]   that we've sort of given up on.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.440]   But if we go together,
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.240]   if we're obedient to what Jesus has called us to do,
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.400]   and we start to bring a new perspective
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.800]   to some of these strongholds,
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.160]   think what would happen.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.800]   So the thought in the city that money is more important
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.720]   than everything else,
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.080]   from God's perspective that looks like,
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.920]   you know what, I'm gonna teach people
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.240]   and teach myself to put God first.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.680]   Right, the thought that you need to be a certain position,
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.240]   to be considered somebody,
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.640]   becomes God loves you and values you
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.760]   and cherishes you unconditionally,
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.240]   no matter who you are.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.320]   This thought that we need to put this immense pressure
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.200]   on our kids to be high achievers
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.040]   and have all these academic achievements
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.240]   becomes Jesus wants you just to have childlike faith.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:30.080]   The thought that this city can never be evangelized
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.640]   because people are too busy chasing the Hong Kong dream
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.400]   becomes with God, all things are possible.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.080]   The idea that separation and separation is a reality
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.440]   that people will never be truly united
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.440]   becomes in Christ there is slave nor free,
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.000]   Jew nor Gentile, male or female.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.080]   This pandemic that we see with our young people
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.520]   giving up hope, turning to drugs and suicide, right?
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.720]   The generations of Hong Kong have no hope
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.480]   becomes you, oh Lord, are my hope and my salvation.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.040]   The thought that the idols of the city
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.280]   will always have a foothold,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.360]   that will never break free from the things
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.440]   that hold us back from really following God
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.920]   become Jesus is the way, the truth and the?
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.800]   The idea that there's families,
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.640]   that children out there,
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.480]   that need families out there right now,
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.080]   foster care and adoption,
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.880]   and that they will always be stuck in this situation,
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.800]   that generations upon generations of fatherlessness,
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.080]   of parentlessness becomes look after the widows
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.880]   and the orphans and a group of Christians
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.480]   will rise up to that challenge
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.440]   and every single child can be placed
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.200]   into a home that loves them.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.360]   Come on church,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:41.200]   let's not sit back and be defeated by our thoughts.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.840]   That's what the enemy is trying to do,
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.480]   to try to confuse our way we think,
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.400]   but this is a call to rise up,
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.680]   change our thinking, change our perspective,
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.720]   ask God to give us a new mind and a new heart
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.680]   so we can walk in obedience to him
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.640]   and be the people he's called to be,
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.520]   do the things that he's called us to do,
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.840]   defeat and claim back some of these uncharted areas
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.360]   that the enemy has taken for the glory of God.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:09.400]   This is how we bring the light of the gospel into the city.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.840]   Jesus had made all things clean,
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.440]   our job now is to bring things back into his presence,
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.040]   do the work of reclaiming city in the name of Jesus
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.960]   and it starts with the way we think church.
