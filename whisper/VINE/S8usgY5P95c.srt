1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
 Well, in 2006, I was living in Germany, I was a youth young adults pastor, and I decided

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,520
 to join a men's basketball team.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,720
 Now you can see I'm pretty tall, but of course there's a lot taller people there too.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,680
 Now it was a pretty competitive league.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,480
 In Germany, if you're familiar with European football, you have different leagues and teams

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
 can move up and down.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
 So I was in the fourth league.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,800
 And if you move up one more level, then it gets very serious.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,040
 And so I was on the team.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,640
 We had a lot of fun as a team and we won a lot.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
 It was great.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,120
 You know, it's more fun when you win games, right?

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,240
 So then we got to the point in the season where we're actually tied for first place

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,120
 and we're about to play the other team that we're tied with.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,840
 And this game was going to determine probably who's going to win the league championship

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,860
 or the league title and then move up to the next league.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,120
 And so we go into the game, we're excited and we miserably failed.

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,360
 We lost that game and we were so frustrated and so disappointed because we were a lot

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,480
 better than what we played.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,240
 I guess, you know, it's one thing to lose against somebody who's better than you.

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,640
 It's another thing to lose against somebody you could potentially actually beat.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
 And we lost.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,200
 And so we're really frustrated, discouraged, disappointed.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
 Probably was it.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,680
 It was like three or four more games after the season.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,720
 So later that week, I got a phone call.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
 My coach called me.

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,860
 Now, my coach never called me.

29
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,360
 So that piqued my curiosity.

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,240
 And he's like, "Hey, Tim, can you come to a meeting on Tuesday nights?"

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,260
 And I was like, "Okay, what's the meeting about?"

32
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,680
 So he told me, "Well, the team, some of the team members, they feel that my coaching is

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,540
 fault for us losing and they want to get rid of me.

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,540
 Can you come and mediate?"

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,300
 And I was like, "Okay, didn't see that one coming."

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,260
 I wasn't part of this conversation.

37
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,020
 So I came and we talked about what was going on.

38
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,180
 So I facilitated a conversation.

39
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,180
 I also talked about Christian principles, like forgiveness, which this was not a Christian

40
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,300
 group.

41
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,860
 And we actually were able to, they were actually able to forgive each other and to move forward

42
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,980
 together as a team.

43
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,020
 And now I don't want to say that everything was perfectly resolved, but it was good enough

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,460
 for us to move forward.

45
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,580
 And I was so thankful for that because actually we had such a great time as a basketball team

46
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:34,500
 and it would be such a pity to let this conflict divide us.

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,420
 Now we actually ended up winning the league title because the other team lost two more

48
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,420
 games.

49
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,100
 So that was a nice side thing.

50
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,620
 And I believe if we would have not stayed together, we probably would have lost some

51
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,060
 as well.

52
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,360
 Now we all have to one degree or another experienced conflict and division.

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,620
 Now for me it was in this case, happened to be in a basketball team where there was conflict

54
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,380
 that almost led to division.

55
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,080
 But we've experienced that in other settings as well.

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,900
 Sometimes that might be in our families, sometimes in our friendships, sometimes it is in marriages,

57
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,180
 sometimes it also is in churches.

58
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,580
 So conflict and division can come in all of our spheres of life where we're broken people

59
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,820
 and we have different perspectives and different viewpoints and different opinions and have

60
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,820
 different capacities.

61
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,700
 Sometimes we're not feeling good and we say something we didn't mean to say and something

62
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,260
 escalates and goes down a really bad road.

63
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,660
 So a lot of times we just end up sitting in the mess of our conflicts.

64
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,260
 And it's not always easy to know how can I move forward out of this conflict, how can

65
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,900
 I move forward out of this division with these people, with whoever it is that we have this

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,420
 conflict going on.

67
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,460
 And so what I want to do with you today, I want to explore with you a question and it

68
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:04,700
 says how can we keep the unity in our relationships when it is so difficult to do so?

69
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,380
 How do you do that?

70
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,740
 There are so many things that can divide us.

71
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,220
 We have different political views.

72
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,040
 We know that one, right?

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,940
 We come from different generations.

74
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,500
 So sometimes different generations we value different things and then there's a conflict

75
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,460
 between younger and older and older and younger generations.

76
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,260
 We come from different cultural backgrounds that also has different values.

77
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,660
 We have different genders, we're men, we're women, we have different perspectives.

78
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,660
 So on all these different things, there's all these things that can potentially, possibly

79
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,160
 divide us, bring conflict, bring this unity.

80
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,580
 And so how can we keep the unity in our relationships and how can we?

81
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,340
 And what do you do because this is so difficult, right?

82
00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:00,140
 Now today we are starting a new sermon here, it's called Forward Together.

83
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,740
 And we in the season where we're in a season where we have the vision of what we call the

84
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,380
 uncharted vision.

85
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,020
 So we shared it on Vision Sunday where we feel called out not to just stay here, but

86
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,300
 to go out and faith into the cities, into workplaces, into our families, into perhaps

87
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,420
 even other countries, wherever this may be.

88
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:27,860
 And then we sense that as we go out that the spirit of God will move.

89
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,920
 There will be these suddenly moments.

90
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,420
 And then the question is, are we ready to respond immediately when the spirit is moving?

91
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:42,920
 And one thing that's important for that is, are we united as a family of faith when those

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,420
 suddenness come that we can immediately respond and move forward together into the purposes

93
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,580
 that God has for us.

94
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,380
 And so this is the heart behind the season.

95
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,000
 We as Pastor Ivan and I and others were praying, we felt this is something that spirit was

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,080
 putting on our hearts.

97
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,020
 And so this is why we're focusing on it.

98
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,140
 There is no, I'm not secretly addressing some specific conflict or disunity, I just also

99
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,420
 want to be clear about that.

100
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
 But it is important.

101
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,060
 And so we're going to look at that.

102
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,580
 And I also want to just say up front, I believe this message, even though I'm going to focus

103
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:24,060
 on church unity, I actually believe that what I'm going to talk about applies to unity and

104
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,140
 other areas in life as well.

105
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:32,620
 So we're just going to come expectantly and see what God has for us here in this message.

106
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:39,120
 Now, let me backtrack.

107
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:49,840
 So one thing that we also see in scripture is that Jesus, he actually prays for the future

108
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
 church.

109
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,800
 And that's in his high priestly prayer in John 17.

110
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,960
 He prays that we're going to be unified, that we're going to be one.

111
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,800
 And I want to just read this to you.

112
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,360
 So I think it's already up there.

113
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,400
 I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them

114
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,560
 may be one.

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,720
 Father, just as you are in me and I am in you, may they also be in us so that the world

116
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,600
 may believe that you have sent me.

117
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,800
 Now, isn't this incredible that Jesus actually prays this prayer for the future church?

118
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,640
 And this is right before he goes to the cross, that this is the thing that is on his heart,

119
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,320
 is our unity, our oneness, which then also impacts our witness, that people know who

120
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,520
 Jesus is, that he truly is who we proclaim he is, and that is tied up with our unity

121
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,480
 and our oneness together.

122
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,080
 And so if this is so important to Jesus and Jesus' heart for us, this needs to be on the

123
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,680
 top of our priority list.

124
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,960
 And so let me take you to the passage that we're going to explore this with today.

125
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,960
 And we're going to go to the book of Ephesians.

126
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,760
 And Ephesians was one of Paul's letters.

127
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:15,240
 And basically, the church in Ephesus was one of his church plants, people from different

128
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,480
 religious backgrounds, different cultural backgrounds.

129
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,800
 They came to faith.

130
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,440
 So these are new Christians from all sorts of diverse backgrounds.

131
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,080
 And they are given, because of the work of Jesus, they are given a new identity and a

132
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,280
 new purpose.

133
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,840
 And one of the questions or one of the things that Paul addresses in this letter is, A,

134
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,320
 he wants to clarify to them that identity, what Christ has done and what that means for

135
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
 their lives.

136
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,860
 So he does that in chapters one all the way to chapter three.

137
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,480
 And then from chapter four to chapter six, he actually talks about how to live out that

138
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,120
 identity.

139
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,640
 Like what does it mean that we are now part of the body of Christ?

140
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,520
 What does it mean to be a child of God?

141
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,240
 And what does it have to do with our everyday life?

142
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,680
 And he unpacks that there.

143
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,720
 So let me take you to our passage.

144
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,840
 We're right at that transition point where we shift from the focus being on what Christ

145
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,680
 has done for us to now what we should do in response.

146
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:23,520
 So in chapter four, starting in verse one, it says this, "As a prisoner for the Lord,

147
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,640
 and I urge you to live a life worthy of your calling, you have received.

148
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,000
 Be completely humble and gentle.

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,740
 Be patient, bearing with one another in love.

150
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,200
 Make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace.

151
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,240
 There is one body and one spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were

152
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,400
 called one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and father of all who is over all and

153
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,560
 through all and in all."

154
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,560
 So here we see in verse one, there's this transition.

155
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,600
 It says, "Then," which also means therefore, so it's referring to all that has happened

156
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,160
 beforehand, all the things that Christ has done.

157
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,440
 So I actually want to give you a little summary of what Paul had been talking about.

158
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,320
 So here it is.

159
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,240
 The blessings in Christ.

160
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,320
 God has blessed you with every spiritual blessing in Christ.

161
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,040
 You are adopted as his child.

162
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,940
 He has redeemed you and forgiven you your sins.

163
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,160
 He has given you the gift of the Holy Spirit.

164
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,840
 He has saved you by grace, made you life in Christ and gave you a purpose.

165
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,180
 He has made you part of the family of God, the body of Christ.

166
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,200
 He has gave us as a church a mission and he gave you a relationship with God where you

167
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,880
 can come freely and confidently to your heavenly father.

168
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
 You have access.

169
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,080
 So these are the truths that Paul has been unpacking to them and more.

170
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,360
 And so if you were to summarize it, we could say that God has called us to belong to him.

171
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,740
 He has called us to be his holy people and he's called us to participate in his redemptive

172
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,420
 mission in this world.

173
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,800
 So this is what Christ has done.

174
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:21,400
 And so what does it mean though, as it says in verse one, to live a life worthy of our

175
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
 calling?

176
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,840
 Like what does Paul actually mean by that?

177
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,880
 Well, one way we could respond to that question is we could say that living life worthy of

178
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,800
 the calling is our love response to what Christ has done in your life.

179
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
 God has blessed you in such incredible ways.

180
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
 He has been so good to you.

181
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,880
 And then us living a life worthy of our calling is responding to his incredible love, this

182
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,240
 incredible thing that Christ has done for us, this grace that he has shown us.

183
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,440
 Now actually it was interesting that Benedict, we've been coordinators, that he earlier had

184
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:08,280
 a football stadium, a picture that he shared with us during the worship.

185
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:16,240
 When I was a boy, I dreamed of being on the national German football team.

186
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,720
 So in Germany, if you know, football is the biggest sport.

187
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,280
 When I was young, Germany won World Cups and things.

188
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,160
 And so I wanted to be on that team.

189
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,760
 Now if I were to be called up, which there was no chance, but if I were to be called

190
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,200
 up to be on this football team, it would be an incredible blessing.

191
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,560
 It would be an incredible privilege.

192
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,520
 It would be such an honor to represent your country and to play in the stadium and to

193
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,440
 give your best.

194
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,400
 But it also would be a responsibility to be on that team.

195
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,760
 I have to carry and conduct myself a certain way because I'm representing my country.

196
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,080
 I have to practice hard.

197
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,400
 And of course in the games, I have to give it my all.

198
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,240
 I have to leave it all out on the field, as they say.

199
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,280
 And so in a similar way, when we become a Christian, we're brought into the family of

200
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,040
 God.

201
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,120
 And living a life worthy of our calling is now to represent this family.

202
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,040
 And it's a blessing, but it's also a responsibility of how we carry out this calling in our everyday

203
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,200
 lives and our everyday moments, the mundane ones and the big ones.

204
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,200
 Do we bring honor to God with how I talk to my family back home and none of you are watching?

205
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,440
 Do I honor God when I interact with a guy that annoys me at work?

206
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,760
 Do I honor God when there's somebody in need and I actually have the time and the resources

207
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,480
 to do something about this person's need?

208
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,800
 And so this is what it means to live a life worthy of our calling.

209
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,520
 It's an incredible blessing and we're responding.

210
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,560
 We receive that and it's amazing, but there's also responsibility in that.

211
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,280
 So I love that earlier, your picture of being in a stadium and celebrating God and then

212
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,280
 going out and representing God with wearing our jersey.

213
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:15,200
 So we get to wear our jersey, our Jesus jersey, in our everyday spheres of life.

214
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,320
 But Paul here, at the beginning of this letter, he gets specific about what it means to live

215
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 a life worthy of the calling.

216
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,240
 There's actually a lot of things that he has to say about as you keep reading chapters

217
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,680
 four, all the way to chapter six, but the first thing that he talks about is unity.

218
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,360
 Isn't that interesting that Paul, that's the first thing that he talks about when he

219
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,080
 talks about living a life worthy of our calling, that he talks about unity.

220
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,120
 So let's look at verse three.

221
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:49,600
 He says this, "Make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace."

222
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,000
 So he's encouraging us to do everything that we can do to be intentional, not just make

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,160
 some effort, make a little effort, make every effort to maintain that unity.

224
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,000
 Now I've been already talking about unity and oneness and all these things, so I think

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,960
 it's actually important that I define a little bit what I mean, because probably right now

226
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,560
 we have different thoughts on this and what exactly that means.

227
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,040
 So here's a little bit more detail on that.

228
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,920
 The church is one because believers from diverse backgrounds have been united to Christ and

229
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,680
 to one another through faith in Jesus and the work of the Holy Spirit.

230
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:38,000
 So God not only has reconciled us to himself, but he also brings reconciliation to each other.

231
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,760
 But I want to unpack these things a little bit further.

232
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,400
 So first, the unity of the church is not something that we create or that we bring about, but

233
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,040
 it's something that we have because of the work that Christ has done.

234
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,460
 Because he has reconciled us to himself and he has reconciled us to another.

235
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,480
 So that's why it says, "Keep," because it's already there.

236
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,240
 And we're meant to keep what God has already accomplished and done on our behalf.

237
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,720
 We're meant to live in it.

238
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,360
 And when we do, it's good, because there's blessing in unity.

239
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,520
 It creates an environment where we as a family can flourish and thrive and where what we

240
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,080
 do as a community together is effective.

241
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,960
 So that's the first thing.

242
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,960
 So it's not something we create, but it's something that God already has created and

243
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,720
 given us.

244
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:37,260
 Now the second way is that unity does not mean homogeneity.

245
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,260
 It does not mean uniformity.

246
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:46,080
 So you've probably heard this before, that unity is not equal to uniformity.

247
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,440
 So we're not all meant to be the same.

248
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,080
 We're not all meant to come from the same socioeconomic background.

249
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,400
 We're not all meant to be of the same ethnicity, the same gender, the same age range.

250
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,000
 That's not what unity is about.

251
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,840
 We're not all meant to have the same personalities.

252
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,760
 So that's not what unity is.

253
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,120
 The unity that the Holy Spirit brings does not erase our differences such as these cultural

254
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:16,720
 backgrounds, generational differences, and so forth, but rather uses those differences,

255
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,500
 our diversity, to build up the body of Christ.

256
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,560
 So every single person, whether you're a baby or a 90-year-old or somewhere in between,

257
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:33,040
 doesn't matter what cultural background you come from, doesn't matter what role you carry,

258
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,640
 doesn't matter what job you have, or all of that.

259
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,160
 You have a role to play in the body of Christ.

260
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,260
 God has a purpose for bringing you here because you are needed.

261
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,900
 You have something to contribute, and you also in a unique way can image who God is

262
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,840
 to us so we can have a deeper and more full understanding of God.

263
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,560
 So you are needed.

264
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,880
 God has brought you here with a purpose for everyone.

265
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,480
 He has a purpose, and it's in that diversity of giftings and of backgrounds that the body

266
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,560
 of Christ is richer and that we bring glory to God.

267
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:21,280
 And third, unity does not mean absence of conflict.

268
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,320
 Maybe it wasn't what we were expecting, right?

269
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,260
 That unity does not mean absence of conflict.

270
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,720
 Think of a marriage.

271
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,520
 You can have unity in a marriage, or you can have unity in a friendship, but you can have

272
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,880
 conflict, right?

273
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,060
 But it's really about how we handle our conflict.

274
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,480
 So I have a statement to that.

275
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,720
 Unity is not the absence of conflict, but it has to do with how we work through those

276
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,900
 disagreements, how we handle our differences.

277
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,440
 There are commitment to unity, and being one in the Spirit is displayed.

278
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,320
 And so really, it's not about us always agreeing on everything.

279
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,060
 It's not about us never having a conflict, but it's how we handle that and how we can

280
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,100
 move forward together that matters and that brings honor to God.

281
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,800
 That we can work through our differences and even maybe agree to disagree on some things,

282
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,120
 but yet still be united and move forward together and bring honor to God.

283
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,680
 And then finally, our unity, when we live it out, it reflects the loving unity between

284
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:30,600
 the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

285
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:38,360
 And when we live out that unity as a local church, it really is a foretaste.

286
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,760
 It really is a display of the power of the gospel.

287
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,720
 Because the gospel is that Jesus died for us, that he rose, and that he has made us

288
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,800
 one family, that he forgives us, that he not only reconciled us to God, but he reconciled

289
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
 us to each other.

290
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,360
 So when we live out that unity, we're actually testifying to the power of God to bring people

291
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,880
 together who usually don't hang out together in other contexts always, or who are a lot

292
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,640
 of times conflicted.

293
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,240
 And so when we do that, it is so powerful.

294
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,160
 And it says to a conflicted and a divided world, "Wow, there is something here at work.

295
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,240
 There's something going on."

296
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,720
 And of course, we know what it is.

297
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,720
 It is the power of the Spirit who has made us family.

298
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,440
 And so that's why it's another reason it's so important for us to make every effort to

299
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,600
 keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

300
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,160
 That's why we need to do that.

301
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,360
 It also brings God glory.

302
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:39,160
 It's part of our witness.

303
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,860
 So this is what we mean by unity, so I spent time unpacking that.

304
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,040
 But this brings me back to our question earlier.

305
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,600
 How can we keep the unity in our relationships when it's so difficult to do so?

306
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,520
 It's nice that we can agree on what unity is, but how do we actually do it?

307
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,640
 Because that's where the rubber meets the road.

308
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,360
 That's where the real life issues are.

309
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,200
 And there's two things in this passage that I want to highlight, where one is a little

310
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,060
 bit more indirectly where Paul speaks to it, the other one he directly speaks to this.

311
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:15,280
 So first, let's look at Ephesians 4 through 6.

312
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,120
 Where Paul, he uses seven words that are preceded by one.

313
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,640
 Let me read this to you again.

314
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,920
 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were

315
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,920
 called one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and

316
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,800
 through all and in all.

317
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,520
 Now what's the significance of this?

318
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,100
 There's actually a lot, and so we could spend a lot of time here, but I just really want

319
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,960
 to boil it down to the most essential thing that this is saying.

320
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:53,040
 And it's this, that there's only one gospel and to believe this gospel means that we enter

321
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,800
 into unity that it creates.

322
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:03,640
 So if you believe this gospel, then for you, you are part of one body.

323
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,200
 There's one Spirit and it's the same Holy Spirit working all of our lives.

324
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
 There's one hope.

325
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,360
 There's not different Christian hope.

326
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
 There's one hope that we share.

327
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
 There's one Lord, which is Jesus.

328
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,560
 There's one faith and there's one baptism.

329
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,720
 We're all baptized into Christ and there is one God and Father.

330
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,000
 We don't have different spiritual fathers.

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,420
 Our heavenly Father is all of our fathers, the Father.

332
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,880
 And so the gospel, when we believe it, and we enter into this oneness that it creates,

333
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,160
 it's the result of the saving work, the redeeming work of Jesus.

334
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,520
 And so unity flows from the gospel where unity is broken.

335
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:55,080
 It reveals that we've drifted from the gospel, that we somehow have lost sight of the gospel.

336
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:01,440
 And so the first thing that we can practically do if we want to keep the unity of the Spirit

337
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,200
 is we need to focus on the gospel.

338
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,500
 We need to get back to focusing on the gospel because we somehow have lost track of Jesus

339
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,140
 and His saving work.

340
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:22,280
 So that means we meditate on that He died on the cross for our sins.

341
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,200
 He forgives us that we don't have this.

342
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,280
 We're not part of the body of Christ because we deserve it, but it's by His grace that

343
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,440
 we are part of this family.

344
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
 We don't deserve it.

345
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,400
 It's undeserved grace, but we receive it.

346
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
 It's a gift.

347
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
 It's a blessing.

348
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,280
 And so remind ourselves of some of these truths and remind ourselves of God's love, not just

349
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,240
 for ourselves, but for other people as well, because He didn't just die for you, even though

350
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,760
 He did also die for you, but He also died for the other person, maybe the one that we

351
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,160
 have the conflict with or that we're having this unity with.

352
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,600
 And so how do we, again, but still, what do we practically do?

353
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,520
 Great, focus on the gospel.

354
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,040
 Well, when I was leading a different church in a different context, I was in a leadership

355
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:15,680
 meeting and there was a person in this meeting who suddenly just criticized me and berated

356
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,800
 me.

357
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,440
 And we're talking, it felt to me like 15 minutes, but it was like a five minute rant of how

358
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,800
 I was a bad pastor.

359
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,040
 My preaching was bad.

360
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,080
 My pastoral care was bad.

361
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,480
 My, you know, everything I did was bad and sucked in this person's opinion.

362
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,240
 And so I'm sitting there, I'm like, you know, like, and I have to say, I didn't manage to

363
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,200
 be completely undefensive.

364
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,000
 So I don't feel like that anyone could, you know, in that moment.

365
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,080
 So there was a little bit defensive, even though I did manage to keep a lot to myself

366
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,640
 and I'm just sitting there and it was so bad that other people started defending me, you

367
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,120
 know, because it was just so, it just was so hurtful.

368
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,720
 And so then the meeting ended.

369
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,640
 There was no way of moving forward in this meeting.

370
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,160
 It just ended abruptly.

371
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,880
 And I was like, first I was confused because it was actually a friend of mine.

372
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,960
 So here's a friend ripping me into shreds in this meeting.

373
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,720
 And so I was like, wow, you know, it's so hurtful.

374
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,800
 Actually went home and cried.

375
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:27,120
 And then after crying and being hurt and sitting in those feelings, I got angry.

376
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,400
 I don't know if you guys ever have these imaginary conversations, dialogues, anyone?

377
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
 Yes.

378
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
 All right.

379
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
 Thank you all the time.

380
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,240
 Well, I had those imaginary conversations and I'm so glad that you do not know what

381
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,880
 I said in those conversations because I was, you know, thinking about like, well, if it's

382
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,080
 so bad here, why are you here?

383
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,880
 You know, why don't you go to a different church?

384
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,920
 All of this stuff is playing in my mind.

385
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
 But I didn't like it.

386
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,200
 You know, I knew that my heart was not right.

387
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,360
 And it's not good.

388
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,680
 It's not good to live in that mind space when you have these imaginary fictional conversations,

389
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,280
 you know, about someone and you say what you're thinking.

390
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,840
 And it's probably better never to say that in that moment.

391
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:19,400
 And so one way that I got back on track was that I went back to the gospel.

392
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,360
 I focused on the gospel.

393
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,520
 And I did that through prayer.

394
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,800
 You know, I asked Jesus to give me wisdom for what was going on.

395
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,200
 And then as I'm praying, I was reminded of Jesus's, that I needed Jesus's grace, you

396
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,480
 know, just as much as the other person needed Jesus's grace.

397
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,200
 And then suddenly I was led to pray for the person that had been very hurtful to me.

398
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,600
 You know, and so when I prayed for the person, I prayed that God would bless this person.

399
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,160
 And then I prayed over that God loves this person.

400
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
 You know, and that's amazing.

401
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,240
 And when we start praying, when we start applying the gospel to our lives, that we give this

402
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:05,520
 Holy Spirit room to work in us and to shift up, shift our perspective and to do something

403
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,720
 that we cannot do on our own strength.

404
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,120
 And so I was able to, and this really was a process.

405
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,600
 This was not a one-time prayer where we're talking like, I don't even remember how long

406
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,920
 it was long.

407
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,720
 So, and then, but I got to the place where like, I reached out, I texted the person like,

408
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,960
 "Hey, can we meet up and talk about what happened?"

409
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,240
 And so I went there and I did say like, "Hey, you know, you, you know how you communicated

410
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,800
 things and made it impossible to receive what you says, because it was just so harsh.

411
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,960
 It was so harsh."

412
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,240
 Now after I had some time and had some time to think about it, there was some truth in

413
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,880
 some of the things that she was saying, but I was like, basically I was unable to receive

414
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 that.

415
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,280
 And then when I talked further, they also found out that actually something quite difficult

416
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,120
 had happened in this person's life.

417
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,760
 Now that didn't excuse what this person did, right?

418
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,160
 But it did give me a context for, to be more compassionate and have more understanding.

419
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,360
 And so we were able to forgive each other and we were able to move forward together.

420
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:20,600
 But this is really not easy, but you know, to make every effort to keep the unity of

421
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,400
 the spirit through the bond of peace, you know, and this doesn't mean, and I also just

422
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,040
 want to say here, I want to clarify one thing.

423
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:34,960
 This does not mean that, you know, when somebody is abusive, that we need to then go step back

424
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,460
 into this abusiveness or things, you know, but, but in most cases that's not the case.

425
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,120
 And so there we are able to make every effort, you know, to forgive and to lean in and sort

426
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
 of cutting off.

427
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,080
 I wanted to cut off, you know, but it was not the right thing to do.

428
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
 And so that's the first thing.

429
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:59,440
 When we, when there's conflict, when there's division and it comes up, we need to focus

430
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,600
 on the gospel and we need strength from outside of ourselves because we don't have the strength

431
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,000
 and God loves giving us the strength.

432
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 So that's the first thing.

433
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:18,880
 The second thing is we find in verse two, I've talked a lot, so I need to find the right

434
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
 page.

435
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
 Here we go.

436
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,040
 All right.

437
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,320
 And so in verse two, it says this, be completely humble and gentle.

438
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,160
 Be patient bearing with one another in love.

439
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,720
 And here, what's, what's interesting is says also completely, you know, just don't be a

440
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:45,600
 little bit humble sometimes be completely humble, be completely humble and gentle and

441
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
 patient.

442
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:53,240
 So Paul, he calls Ephesians to embrace these characteristics.

443
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,720
 And just think he's actually talking about living a life worthy of your calling.

444
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,080
 Now when we think of living a life worthy of your calling, we probably don't think about

445
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,240
 embracing humility, gentleness, and patience.

446
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,040
 Those are probably not the first things that come to mind.

447
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,080
 We're probably thinking of doing something bold and courageous for God.

448
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,560
 He's talking about a heart posture that we need.

449
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,160
 And these are, you know, two of them are listed in the Galatians five, verse 22 and 23 as

450
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,000
 part of being part of the fruit of the spirit, but they're actually all three of them is

451
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,160
 the work of the spirit in our lives that brings forth these things that builds us into our

452
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,960
 hearts.

453
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,300
 But I want to unpack them a little bit.

454
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,920
 So the first quality is humility.

455
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,360
 Now humility was actually looked down upon during Paul's time.

456
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,080
 It was seen as shameful, was seen as weak.

457
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,760
 And so it's, so it's amazing, you know, that Paul elevates this.

458
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,400
 And the reason why he does this is because he sees that in Jesus, because Jesus humbled

459
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,800
 himself was king of all kings, who humbled himself, was born, you know, in human flesh,

460
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,960
 laid down his life on a cross, died.

461
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,320
 And so he embraces this value that culture around him didn't embrace.

462
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:17,960
 But if you understand God's grace, you know, his forgiveness in our lives, that we're broken

463
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,080
 people, that we're sinful people who need his forgiveness, who need his grace, that

464
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,200
 actually should bring humility to our lives.

465
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,560
 You know, because we stand in this relationship with God in the first place, just by his grace,

466
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,480
 not because we're great people, but because God is great and because he loves us greatly.

467
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,360
 So again, you know, it's going back to the gospel in some ways.

468
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,120
 And when we focus on that, we understand that actually humility should characterize our

469
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
 lives.

470
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,320
 So that's the first one.

471
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,160
 The opposite of humility is pride.

472
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
 We walk in pride.

473
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,040
 And I think we can see when we walk in pride that that leads to conflict and division,

474
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
 right?

475
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,360
 Whereas humility allows us to work through our differences.

476
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,600
 Well, the second and the third characteristics are gentleness and patience.

477
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:11,580
 And again, when we look at God, he is so gentle and so patient with us.

478
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,800
 Just think of your life.

479
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,360
 Think of the dumb stuff we do.

480
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,760
 Think of maybe how long we've been living lives even apart from Christ.

481
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,140
 And yet he is patient with us to bring us into his family, to show us love, to forgive

482
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:32,040
 us yet that millions time again, when we mess up, when we do something stupid.

483
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,000
 And again, that's so characteristic of Christ.

484
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,400
 He wants us to be gentle and he wants us to be patient with other people.

485
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,800
 And the opposite of gentleness is harshness.

486
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,940
 And the opposite of patience is impatience, of course.

487
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:55,040
 So the second way that we keep the unity of the spirit is by embracing humility, gentleness,

488
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
 and patience.

489
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:03,600
 Now, going back to that story that I was telling, I was lacking all three of them.

490
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,600
 I didn't have the humility, I didn't have the gentleness, and I didn't have the patience

491
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
 to begin with.

492
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,520
 And I think if we're honest, a lot of times we would lack those things, especially in

493
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,360
 the heat of the moment, right?

494
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,780
 Like they're not right there.

495
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,340
 And so how do we embrace those characteristics?

496
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,200
 How can they become more part of our lives?

497
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,800
 Well, again, it was through prayer in this case, where we give the Holy Spirit room to

498
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,560
 do this work in our hearts so we can have those things, that we can carry those things

499
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,360
 into a conflict to keep things from escalating even further, and to bring this unity that

500
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,720
 honors God.

501
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,980
 And so God really helped me through this time to move from pride to humility, where I really

502
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,200
 just wanted to cut off this person and tell them what I think with my imaginary conversations,

503
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:02,000
 where I wanted to speak harsh words to the person, to actually speak gently to the person.

504
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,640
 And then where I was impatient, I was like, "That's it, we're done, leave."

505
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:20,860
 And He moved me towards patience, where I was willing to work through our differences.

506
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:30,260
 So when we embrace these values, it really allows us to assume the best about other people,

507
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:36,060
 to deescalate, to move closer instead of moving further away.

508
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:42,620
 And I want to invite the worship team to come up.

509
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,400
 Jesus, He prayed for our unity.

510
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,860
 His prayer, His heart's desire for us is that we are one.

511
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:56,140
 You know, that we are one, that we are a family that is united and has unity with each other.

512
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,320
 He deeply desires that for us, that is His prayer.

513
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,620
 And He knows that is so critical for us, because when we are one, when there's oneness, we

514
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:12,180
 can thrive, we can grow in our faith, we can be a community that has fun.

515
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,860
 Come on, if there's division, it's no fun.

516
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,900
 We can be effective.

517
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,020
 What we do has kingdom impact.

518
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,580
 It's amazing.

519
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,580
 Again, you can think of marriage.

520
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,460
 If there's division in marriage, man, it is just draining.

521
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,260
 Or when there's division in friendship, it's just draining.

522
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:39,060
 But when there is unity, it creates an environment of flourishing, of thriving, of goodness.

523
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:47,100
 And so God really wants us in all spheres of our lives to have unity, but especially

524
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,900
 also for us as a church family.

525
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:57,060
 And so living a life worthy of our calling as we want to move out in the season into

526
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:04,540
 uncharted territory, as we want to love the city, we need to make every effort to have

527
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,960
 the unity of the Spirit.

528
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,500
 And when we do, God's love flows through us as a community.

529
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,660
 It touches your lives and it touches the lives of other people.

530
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,980
 And God wants to touch lives through us.

531
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:30,600
 And it would break my heart if we would stand in the way of that.

532
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,260
 So we need to make every effort, but we're not on our own.

533
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,060
 This is not making every effort is not out of our own strength.

534
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:45,820
 It's the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, which gives us the grace, the strength, the motivation,

535
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:52,420
 the wisdom, and all of that we lack to move forward.

536
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:59,340
 And so right now I want to invite you to reflect on this question you see up on the screen.

537
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:05,900
 In what relationship do you need to move from pride to humility?

538
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,100
 From harshness to gentleness?

539
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:19,420
 From impatience to patience, and from a lack of love to love?

540
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,660
 And I want to invite you right now to just on your own to pray, to bring whatever is

541
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,700
 going on, whether in your marriage, whether in your friendships, whether in this church

542
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:36,940
 community, and just to open your heart to the work of the Spirit, to bring transformation,

543
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:42,060
 to bring change, to bring healing, to let His love flow.

544
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:49,380
 So I'm just going to give a couple of minutes to do that, and then I'm going to come back

545
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,380
 and pray over us.

546
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,380
 So let's pray right now.

547
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,140
 Let's do this.

548
00:37:52,140 --> 00:38:02,140
