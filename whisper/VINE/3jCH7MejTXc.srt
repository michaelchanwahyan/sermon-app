1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 So right now I want to invite up Pastor Chapman.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,880
 Let's give him a warm welcome.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,960
 Yes.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,000
 Love this guy.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,240
 Hey, so excited.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,600
 He today, he did double duty.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,720
 He's preaching, preaching Cantonese.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,040
 Now he's going to switch to English.

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,080
 I hope.

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,040
 Yeah, maybe if he feels like it.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,060
 Yeah, but let's, let's pray for Chapman.

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,200
 Let's pray for us as we prepare our hearts so you can stretch out your hands towards

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
 him and let me pray for us.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,200
 Jesus, thank you so much for Chapman and his love for you, his love for your word, his

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
 desire to proclaim you.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,440
 And I pray that you would powerfully would speak through him today as the words that

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,520
 you have given him for us, that you will move by your Holy Spirit and that we will, yeah,

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,160
 have what we, what I said earlier, that, that we are here with a purpose because you want

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,000
 to speak to us and that you would speak to us and that you will bring life and change

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,440
 and freedom through the words that Chapman preaches.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,040
 So pray for also your Holy Spirit anointing and blessing on him and strengthen energy

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,040
 and pray all this in your name, Jesus.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
 Amen.

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,040
 Amen.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
 Thank you, Pastor Tim.

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
 Can we put a hand together for Pastor Tim?

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,760
 Ah, summer holidays.

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,000
 Anyone enjoying summer right now?

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Anyone here?

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 No.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 One or two of you.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Okay, that's good.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 That's good enough.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,560
 So summer holiday, we always have mixed feelings, right?

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,880
 If you're a student, you know, it's the most wonderful time in the year.

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,880
 If you're a parent, that means you start to, okay, what I'm going to do with my kid during

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,880
 summer.

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,680
 For me, I was a bit, I can't say I'm lucky, but my wife and my daughters, they're actually

40
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
 in Singapore.

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,240
 They've been in Singapore for a week.

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:02:00,240
 So I lived on my own for a week and it feels very strange.

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,320
 She's listening, okay?

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
 So better don't say that.

45
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,640
 I think she's watching.

46
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,280
 I just feel very awkward.

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,760
 I haven't been living a single life for a very long time.

48
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,440
 And you can imagine the dishes that pile up in my kitchen, laundry.

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,160
 Okay, I did my laundry yesterday.

50
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:28,560
 But anyway, beginning of summer, I still remember when I was primary five.

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,320
 The week before summer holiday started, I was 11 years old back then.

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,240
 So in school, we normally, in local schools, we call it the post-exam period.

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,160
 Basically there's no class.

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,480
 Teacher's not going to teach anymore.

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,700
 We're just freely like have fun.

56
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,520
 So we bring all kinds of chess, Uno, Jenga, everything that we're going to enjoy this

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,040
 afternoon with the youth group, we did it during that period of time, post-exam period.

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,240
 So that was really the most exciting time of the year for students.

59
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:06,080
 Until one particular morning, my teacher, she brought a whole pile of books into the

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,160
 room and she started distributing them.

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,680
 And if you're like me, you grew up in a local school system, every summer we got something

62
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
 to do.

63
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,080
 That's a summer holiday workbook.

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
 What an oxymoron.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,560
 The most evil invention ever in human history, you know?

66
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
 That's not right.

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
 That's injustice.

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,680
 Imagine, I'm not joking, imagine this.

69
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,800
 Imagine you're going to start your annual leave tomorrow and today your boss call you

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,560
 up and give you work to do.

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,240
 What will you say?

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,600
 That's injustice, right?

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,320
 That's the most evil invention ever in human history, period.

74
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,280
 So that summer, I made up my mind.

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,960
 I said, I'm not going to let this book, this 80-page book ruin my freedom, the joy of my

76
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
 freedom in the summer holiday.

77
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:06,840
 So as soon as that book landed on my desk, I turn it over, I flip over, I wrote my name

78
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,160
 down and then I flip another page and I started writing on it.

79
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,400
 By the end of that school day, like before I went home, I finished 20 pages of that book.

80
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,720
 But I didn't stop there because my goal is to enjoy the freedom of my summer.

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,980
 I'm not going to let my parents tell me, "Hey, have you finished your summer homework?"

82
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,920
 I'm going to enjoy it.

83
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,440
 So within one or two days, I just keep doing it, keep doing it, and I finished the entire

84
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,800
 book before summer holiday even started.

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,040
 So I was so excited that evening when my dad came back from work.

86
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,680
 I was just so eager to tell him I was expecting a little bit of compliment.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,760
 So I said, "Dad, I finished the entire summer workbook."

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,800
 And this is what he said, "Oh, what?

89
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
 You finished your entire summer holiday workbook?

90
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,280
 Then what are you going to do throughout the summer?"

91
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,440
 I guess now I'm going to go buy some more exercise for you.

92
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,320
 Within a split second, one of my greatest achievement by far in my 11 years of life

93
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,960
 has turned into one of my greatest mistakes in life.

94
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,840
 Freedom, right?

95
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,800
 We all want freedom.

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,520
 Freedom is something that is encoded in our human DNA.

97
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,240
 Can I get an amen for that?

98
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,080
 Who doesn't love freedom, right?

99
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,240
 Even my one and a half year old daughter, she understands what is freedom or she demonstrates

100
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
 her eager desire for freedom.

101
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
 Whenever I'm holding Mabel, she will struggle.

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,280
 She will want to get down and run around.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,320
 Whenever she's done with dinner, the first thing she does is to try to get rid of her

104
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,080
 harness or the seatbelt and try to get down, jump off the chair.

105
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:01,480
 Even a one and a half year old baby, they understand the idea of freedom, which is the

106
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:09,120
 absence of any external constraints or interference that limits one's actions or choices.

107
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,800
 For my one year old, the external constraint is actually that seatbelt or sometimes her

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
 father's arms.

109
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,040
 For an 11 year old version of me, that external constraint was actually that 80 page summer

110
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:30,120
 holiday workbook that is restricting me from enjoying the freedom of my summer holiday.

111
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,280
 I'm sure many of us in this room, I'm sure in different stages, different periods of

112
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,320
 life, we all face certain external constraints or interference in life that are limiting

113
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,600
 your choices or limiting your actions.

114
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,080
 Something like maybe you have very long working hours that is restricting you from really

115
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,360
 getting a life, affecting your work-life balance.

116
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:03,480
 Or maybe it's an economic external constraint, which could be a debt or could be a health

117
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:12,300
 constraint such as an illness, be it physical or mental, or it could be expectations coming

118
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,240
 from your family, coming from your friends, your bosses, your colleagues, or even social

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,400
 norms or discriminations that you want to get rid of, you want to be set free from.

120
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:34,000
 As human beings, we face different external constraints in our lives and we desire freedom.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,920
 More precisely, we desire freedom from all these constraints.

122
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,920
 So a political philosopher, his name is Isaiah Berlin, he described this kind of freedom,

123
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,280
 namely the freedom from something.

124
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,060
 He called it, this absence of external constraints, he called it a negative freedom.

125
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,120
 So don't worry, the use of the word negative doesn't imply it's a bad thing.

126
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,720
 It simply points to the fact that there indeed is another kind of freedom in human life.

127
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,320
 And yes, you would have guessed it, it's called positive freedom.

128
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,200
 While negative freedom, it's a freedom from something, positive freedom, on the other

129
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,280
 hand, is the freedom to do something, to achieve something.

130
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,780
 It goes beyond the absence of external constraints and highlights the presence of certain conditions

131
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,020
 or opportunities or resources that would enable an individual to pursue their goals or to

132
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,200
 fulfill their potentials.

133
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,820
 For example, we have free basic education here in Hong Kong for our kids, for our next

134
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,520
 generation that actually enables them to choose what they want to do in the future.

135
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,140
 We try to prepare them as much as possible.

136
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,240
 Because of this free education, they have a choice in the future, they have freedom

137
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
 to choose.

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,880
 And also, since we promote gender equality in workplaces, we want to make sure even females

139
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,840
 or people from different genders, they have equal opportunity, they have the freedom to

140
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,380
 choose what they want to do.

141
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,120
 So these are examples of positive freedoms.

142
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,360
 So the bottom line is, for humans to flourish, we need both kinds of freedom.

143
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,920
 We need the positive freedom, we need the negative freedom as well.

144
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,480
 And in his letters to the Galatians, Paul ties this concept of freedom to his core message

145
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,780
 of the gospel.

146
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,360
 So let's dive back right into this book that we've been reading for the last couple of

147
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
 weeks.

148
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,700
 We're going to start from the beginning of chapter five.

149
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,040
 It says, "It's for freedom that Christ has set us free.

150
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,080
 Confirm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery."

151
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,640
 So in the previous weeks, we have been preaching on this heartfelt message Paul so passionately

152
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,480
 wanted to communicate to the believers of Galatia.

153
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,760
 That the works of the law, the legalistic approach of Judaism, the circumcision whatsoever,

154
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,720
 these are the yoke of slavery.

155
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,280
 Paul went at length in this letter to cover every angle, to persuade, to tell these Galatians,

156
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,440
 you shouldn't listen to those people who force you to follow the Jewish law as a necessary

157
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,480
 mean for salvation.

158
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:26,120
 You shouldn't listen to them at all because Christ is enough.

159
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,040
 You don't need anything extra.

160
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,400
 So today, again, sometimes we face that, we face being a Christian, following Christ,

161
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
 it's not enough.

162
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,260
 Maybe I should do something more.

163
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,800
 Maybe I should behave a little bit better for me to have a better standing in front

164
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
 of God.

165
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,480
 And Paul is telling us, Christ is enough, period.

166
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,840
 You don't need anything else.

167
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,640
 You don't need anything extra.

168
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,000
 And Paul is trying to make it crystal clear here.

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,680
 It's not that you don't need both Christ and the works of law.

170
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,920
 No, no, it's not even that.

171
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,320
 It's that you actually can't have both.

172
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,680
 It's an either or situation here.

173
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,600
 You either try to fulfill the law by your own effort in order to obtain righteousness

174
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,320
 in God's eyes, which by the way, a lot of people, every single one has tried and they

175
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
 failed.

176
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,720
 Or you obtain righteousness by putting your faith in Jesus alone.

177
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,680
 You either work really, really hard for it, or you get it for free.

178
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,800
 What you cannot do it, now you already have it for free and you try to earn it again by

179
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,760
 your own effort.

180
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,880
 Paul is saying, if you want to try that way, yeah, be my guest, but Christ will have nothing

181
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,760
 to do with you.

182
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,400
 So imagine for a second with me, if someone is offering you a big house as a gift, in

183
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,560
 Hong Kong, offering you any size of house is a huge gift already.

184
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
 Let it be a big house.

185
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:02,360
 If someone is offering you a huge, big flat or house or whatever as a gift, and you said,

186
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,920
 wow, thank you, but how much should I pay you?

187
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:14,120
 I'm like, seriously, if you really want to pay, you're going to pay in the full price.

188
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,620
 That's what Paul's want to say.

189
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,520
 So he said, every man who lets himself be circumcised, that he's obligated to obey the

190
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,080
 whole law.

191
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,860
 You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ.

192
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,020
 You have fallen away from grace.

193
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,800
 And I want to be very, very clear with you all here.

194
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,480
 Occasionally we may hear this phrase, fallen away from grace.

195
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,600
 And most of the time, the person who says it is trying to describe another person, mostly

196
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,400
 Christians, committing a sin or a moral failure.

197
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,120
 That's when we say, oh, that person is fallen away from grace.

198
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,960
 But that's the exact opposite of what Paul is trying to say here.

199
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,360
 You cannot fall away from grace by sinning.

200
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,760
 Although that's still an issue that we have to tackle, still an issue that we have to

201
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,640
 deal with.

202
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,760
 On a contrary, you fall away from grace by trying to prove you're righteous, or you fall

203
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,360
 away from grace by trying to earn God's favor with your own merits.

204
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,800
 Oh God, I've been serving in this church week in, week out for the last 10 years.

205
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,160
 Why don't you answer my prayers?

206
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,640
 I've been reading the Bible, I've been going to church, I've been singing, I've been doing

207
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,120
 all these Christian things.

208
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
 Why, why?

209
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,200
 Or when you start to compare yourself, oh, you know what, I'm a better person, I do this

210
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,840
 and that and that and that, and the list go on and on.

211
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 When we try to prove that we are righteous, when we try to prove that we're a good person

212
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:55,160
 by what we do, we fall away from grace.

213
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:02,560
 So the moment we try to prove how much we have paid for something that we receive as

214
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,560
 a free gift, that's the moment we disqualify ourselves to receive it.

215
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,420
 That's what Paul is trying to say.

216
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,800
 So you can submit to what Paul described here as a yoke of slavery, an external constraint

217
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,760
 if you want to try that way.

218
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:27,120
 Then, or if you really want that freedom from Christ, what he's offering you is to set you

219
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
 free.

220
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,280
 It's to take away that yoke of slavery from you, this external constraint from you.

221
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,160
 You are free from the slavery of the law.

222
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,800
 You are free from the misery of ever trying and yet still fall short of God's standard

223
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,120
 of righteousness.

224
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,800
 Paul said it is for this kind of freedom that Christ has set you free.

225
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,920
 Let me be honest with you, I've been a Christian for more than 30 years.

226
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,240
 By the way, I grew up in the church.

227
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,080
 I've been in the church since I was very, very young.

228
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,880
 You can do the math.

229
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,800
 In my 30 plus years of Christian life, I didn't always really understand what freedom in Christ

230
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 was about.

231
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,800
 When I was young, I thought following Jesus or following God was all about these do's

232
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
 and don'ts.

233
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,000
 If I follow them, if I behave, maybe God will be pleased with me.

234
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,400
 If he's pleased with me, probably my life would be a little bit easier, better, or I

235
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,720
 would have a little bit more joy down in my heart.

236
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,400
 Like singing a song, I have this joy, joy, joy, joy down here.

237
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,840
 Okay, nobody knows that.

238
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
 It's so old.

239
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
 Okay, all right.

240
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,280
 I don't know what I want to say.

241
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,800
 But anyway, so I thought if I do all that, all the do's and don'ts written here on this

242
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,800
 book, maybe God would love me a little bit more and I'll feel a little bit happier.

243
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,440
 I'll be a better Christian.

244
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:54,760
 And that's exactly how I have fallen away from grace.

245
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:02,480
 So that's why when I have fallen away from grace, when I sin, when I failed, when I stumbled,

246
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,880
 I felt incredibly guilty inside of me and I was so ashamed of myself.

247
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,360
 And that's exactly the curse of the law or the slavery of the law that Paul was trying

248
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,280
 to describe here.

249
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:22,240
 But Jesus came to set us free from that curse, from that slavery, from that shame, because

250
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,440
 I'm no longer judged according to the law, but I'm accepted according to grace.

251
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,760
 And that's freedom.

252
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,520
 If you still remember the two kinds of freedom I mentioned earlier, you would probably notice

253
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,560
 the freedom mentioned by Paul here, the freedom from slavery of the law, it's actually a negative

254
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
 freedom.

255
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,760
 Again, this term doesn't mean it's bad or whatever, but let me tell you, as a parent

256
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:58,660
 of two toddlers, I really have this love-hate relationship with negative freedom.

257
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,840
 You see, every Sunday when I let Mabel walk around here in church or in the playground

258
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,560
 somewhere, I actually, I'm quite nervous inside.

259
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,240
 So now all of them, they're in Singapore and we were FaceTiming a couple of days ago and

260
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,120
 Ross just told me, "Oh, Mabel, she fell."

261
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:20,040
 And when Mabel came into the camera and she saw me, she started pointing at the floor

262
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,520
 and telling me how she fell and how much it hurt, a one and a half year old trying to

263
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,960
 tell me, and I could see that bump on her lips and I'm like, "Oh, my heart breaks."

264
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,040
 And again, Singapore last year, when Megan was two and a half years old, we were in the

265
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,740
 zoo in Singapore.

266
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,180
 So halfway through the day, we're at this huge playground.

267
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:48,840
 They have this huge giant slide structure, whatever you call that, and so Megan was playing

268
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
 there.

269
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
 And at first I'm like, "Yeah, okay.

270
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,040
 I'm not sure if I should let her run around."

271
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,280
 So I acted as the external constraint or protector, if you will.

272
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,360
 I'm like, "Maybe she's too young to do that."

273
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,820
 But after maybe 10, 15 minutes, I'm like, "Oh, okay.

274
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,640
 Maybe she can explore that a little bit on her own.

275
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,200
 Maybe I don't have to be overprotective.

276
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,000
 Okay, I'll just let her run."

277
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,960
 And she gets more excited and she started running.

278
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,360
 And just so happened, all of a sudden, she tripped and she fell.

279
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:28,320
 And normally in this kind of playground slide structure, they will be covered by a layer

280
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,920
 of plasticky kind of materials.

281
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,020
 So when you hit it, it's not too hard, right?

282
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,240
 But I don't know what they're doing.

283
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,560
 Okay, I shouldn't say anything bad about Singapore.

284
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,660
 I'm going there tomorrow.

285
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,200
 But I don't know what happened to that playground.

286
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,960
 At that giant structure, there are some stairs.

287
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,220
 And on the stairs, they actually put a metal plate on every single flight of stair.

288
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,840
 And just so happened, when Megan tripped and fell, her forehead hit the edge of one of

289
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,520
 those metal plates.

290
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,600
 The whole playground went silent when she started crying, just like this.

291
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
 And I rushed to her.

292
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
 I freaked out.

293
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,480
 And when I look at her, there was a bump as big as the size of a golf ball on her forehead

294
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,280
 here.

295
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:25,640
 So we spent the rest of the day in the emergency room of the children's hospital that day.

296
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
 Tell me about it.

297
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,640
 Freedom.

298
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,080
 Yeah, I like freedom, maybe.

299
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,640
 But at the same time, it's kind of a scary idea to me.

300
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,780
 You see, when we're set free, when we can do whatever we want to do, we're simultaneously

301
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,440
 exposed to a world of danger.

302
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,920
 And all the Asian parents in the room can say amen with me, right?

303
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,000
 Our freedom can lead us into trouble.

304
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,760
 Best case scenario, it's some minor accidents, no big deal, like Megan's bumping her forehead.

305
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,920
 But worse come to worse, we could abuse that freedom and cause serious damage to ourselves

306
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,880
 and to people around us.

307
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,160
 So why on earth would God want us to have freedom if that could mean potential harm

308
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
 to us?

309
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,360
 Have you ever thought about that?

310
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,120
 The answer lies in the truth and the full picture of the idea of freedom in Christ.

311
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,240
 Yes, we know freedom in Christ on one hand, it's freedom from law or freedom from the

312
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,200
 yoke of an impossible task to earn God's favor by our own power and effort.

313
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
 Yes.

314
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:46,880
 We live a life free of guilt, free of shame, but all of these guilt and shame, they all

315
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,720
 come from our sins and our brokenness inside of us.

316
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,440
 And even if we are honest, even when we're Christians, even when we're Christ followers,

317
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,840
 even when we are in church, week in, week out, we are still vulnerable to that kind

318
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,200
 of temptation, to our sinful desires inside of us.

319
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,240
 We're still challenged by our own sinful nature on a daily basis.

320
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,800
 So this is why Paul describes, he said, he described that as the flesh here.

321
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,940
 And he said, do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh.

322
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:25,840
 If we're driven by our flesh, our selfishness, our sinful desires, then freedom from the

323
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,760
 law would only have a disastrous ending.

324
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:41,520
 So in order to be truly free from sin, we actually need something else or someone else.

325
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,480
 We need more than the absence of external constraints.

326
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,360
 We actually need the presence of a power that would overcome the power of sin and darkness

327
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,200
 inside of us so that we could have the ability to choose what is good, to choose what is

328
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,640
 right, to choose what would bring love and joy and peace, to choose what would build

329
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,680
 others up instead of tearing others down.

330
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,480
 We need a power to choose.

331
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,840
 And that's where the presence of God comes in through his Holy Spirit.

332
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,400
 We need the presence of God through his Spirit inside of us.

333
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,400
 And that's exactly what we get when we start to follow Jesus.

334
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,520
 And that's why Paul is saying in another letter, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is

335
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,200
 freedom.

336
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,800
 If freedom from the law is a negative kind of freedom, then the freedom we receive in

337
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,320
 the power of the Holy Spirit, it's actually a positive freedom.

338
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,520
 He gave us his Holy Spirit to dwell inside of us, to give us the power to overcome our

339
00:22:51,520 --> 00:23:00,320
 flesh so that I will or we will finally experience true freedom in our life.

340
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,040
 So Paul says, "You, my brothers and sisters, you were called to be free, but do not use

341
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,480
 your freedom to indulge the flesh.

342
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,360
 Rather serve one another humbly in love, for the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this

343
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,480
 one command, love your neighbor as yourself."

344
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,360
 And you may be wondering, "Paul, you just said we're free from the law, then why did

345
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,680
 you bring this up again?"

346
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,880
 And let me tell you, this is the exciting part.

347
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
 This is a great part.

348
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,080
 All right, Paul is going to explain to us what is the positive freedom in the Holy Spirit

349
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,480
 and what it's all about.

350
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,080
 And in fact, he's going to spend the rest of the entire chapter to explain what walking

351
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,840
 in the Holy Spirit would look like.

352
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,960
 So church, can I encourage us to just spend a little bit of time this week to just read

353
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,800
 through Galatians 5 and allow God to speak to us directly through his word, just like

354
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,600
 what Pastor Tim was talking about last week.

355
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,240
 Then come back next week again and allow God to speak to us through the sermon as well.

356
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
 Can we do that?

357
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,400
 All right, all right, two people said they can do that.

358
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,720
 All right, I know you have a busy schedule, I know summer is starting, but yeah, I'm sure

359
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,280
 you'll be blown away by this message that Paul has written.

360
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:21,120
 Okay, so now I'm going to explain this, but in order to explain it, let me go back to

361
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,040
 a few verses earlier.

362
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,720
 Let's go back to verse four.

363
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,800
 So just now we read, "You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated

364
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,920
 from Christ.

365
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,160
 You have fallen away from grace.

366
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,320
 For through the Spirit, we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope.

367
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,140
 For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value.

368
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,600
 The only thing that counts is faith expressing through love."

369
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,960
 These two verses are loaded with rich theological content, actually.

370
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,360
 It's one of the few places in the New Testament where you find faith, hope, and love appearing

371
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,840
 together.

372
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,960
 But if I want to explain this to you, I'm going to need some help from my iPad.

373
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,200
 So I'm going to do this.

374
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
 Hold on.

375
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
 All right.

376
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,200
 Where are we here?

377
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
 Okay.

378
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
 Oops.

379
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:24,000
 Let me connect my iPad to the screen.

380
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Give it a moment.

381
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,080
 Thank you for your patience.

382
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,560
 Now we're on.

383
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
 Okay.

384
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,720
 So let me try to explain this.

385
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,000
 So we're humans, right?

386
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,200
 So we have to put a human here.

387
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
 We're human.

388
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
 Yeah.

389
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
 Like me, I know.

390
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,120
 We're a human with sinful nature.

391
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,000
 So you see, sin has always been inside of us.

392
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,640
 What does sin actually mean?

393
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,440
 It means our relationship with God and with one another was kind of like destroyed.

394
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:03,520
 So you see, our relationship with God and with others are destroyed because of sin.

395
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,960
 So we cannot reach God.

396
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
 And what is righteousness?

397
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,920
 Righteousness is one of the very, one of the facet or one of the angle to look at it.

398
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:18,080
 It's when we are in the right relationship with God and with everyone else.

399
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,320
 That's why when the teachers of the law came and asked Jesus, what's the most important

400
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,680
 thing in the law?

401
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,240
 Jesus says, you know, the whole law is summarized in these two commands.

402
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,640
 Love the Lord your God with all your heart, might, soul, and you know, whatever, whatever.

403
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,520
 And then the second thing, it's love your neighbor as yourself.

404
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,800
 If you can fulfill that, you're basically fulfilling the entire law.

405
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,560
 And that's the old way to look at righteousness.

406
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,040
 And so righteousness, it's here.

407
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,720
 Oh, I should stand here.

408
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,040
 Thank you for reminding me, Ada, just now.

409
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,280
 So righteousness, let me put it up a little bit more.

410
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,800
 Righteousness means we're in a good relationship.

411
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:05,880
 We're in the right relationship with God and others.

412
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,400
 Let me draw a very beautiful red heart here to represent that.

413
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,520
 Oh, I like it.

414
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,620
 So in the past, righteousness could only be obtained by the works of the law.

415
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:27,480
 So God gave us the law and human, what we have to do, you see, what we have to do, we

416
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,180
 have to put in our works.

417
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:35,360
 So if you have works of the law, you can try to obtain righteousness, but we know everybody

418
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,840
 tried and they failed.

419
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,680
 So this way, actually, it didn't work for them.

420
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,680
 And then we know, so this way didn't work.

421
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,080
 Nobody actually got saved like that.

422
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,040
 So now we know Jesus, he came.

423
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,600
 So let me use a red cross to represent Jesus.

424
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,640
 This is a cross, if you can imagine.

425
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,160
 This is a cross, this is Jesus.

426
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,160
 He died on the cross for us.

427
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:07,320
 And through Jesus and his cross, by grace, and we can obtain this righteousness.

428
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,520
 So it's by grace through faith, right, that we can obtain righteousness.

429
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,100
 Let me just draw it here.

430
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,600
 So this is how we reach righteousness.

431
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,180
 So everybody following, this is the basics of Christianity.

432
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,760
 If you don't have an idea what I'm talking about, I highly encourage you to join the

433
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,920
 next baptism class.

434
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
 Thank you.

435
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,640
 All right, that's what we explained there.

436
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,440
 All right, so this is the background.

437
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,240
 Oh, by the way, one more thing.

438
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,880
 When we accept Jesus, we actually have one more privilege.

439
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,440
 That is, sorry, I'm gonna put the Holy Spirit here.

440
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
 That is the Holy Spirit.

441
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,560
 Okay, Holy Spirit, where are you?

442
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,360
 Holy Spirit, you are here.

443
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,440
 So we have the Holy Spirit with us here.

444
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,560
 All right, so yes, that's the basic.

445
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:00,120
 We have the Holy Spirit by grace through faith, we have obtained this righteousness.

446
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,880
 Okay, now let's get back to verse five, what Paul is talking about.

447
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,960
 Paul is saying here, through the Spirit, by faith, we're waiting for the righteousness

448
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,000
 that we hope for.

449
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,820
 So Paul gave us a new element here, that there is a hope here.

450
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,160
 And this is what we hope for.

451
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,100
 Let me use another color.

452
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:29,080
 This is what we hope for, by the Holy Spirit and by our faith, we are looking forward to

453
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,320
 this thing we hope for.

454
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,080
 Righteousness is something we hope for.

455
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,440
 Righteousness is like loving your neighbor as yourself.

456
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,120
 This is something we hope for.

457
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,580
 What does it mean?

458
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,580
 So let me break it down for you.

459
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:49,240
 First of all, hope in the Christian language is always about something in the future.

460
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,520
 It's something that we don't have it yet.

461
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,840
 We can't see it yet.

462
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,460
 It's something it's not seen already.

463
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,500
 So that's why we have to hope for it.

464
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,300
 We don't see it.

465
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,420
 We don't have it right now, but we're kind of so sure that it's there in the future.

466
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
 That's why we have hope.

467
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,380
 We have hope that Jesus will come back.

468
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,540
 We have hope that our bodies will raise again and we'll have eternal life.

469
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,380
 That's what we hope for.

470
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,580
 Are you following me so far?

471
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:25,360
 So Paul is saying through the Holy Spirit, by faith, we have a hope and that hope, it's

472
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
 a righteousness.

473
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,480
 And you are like, Chapman, what are you talking about?

474
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,520
 I thought we have hope already.

475
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,240
 I thought we have righteousness already.

476
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
 Yes.

477
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,960
 The moment you become a Christian, the moment you put your faith in Jesus, you receive,

478
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,160
 you give Jesus all your sinfulness and you receive his righteousness.

479
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,980
 And in God's eyes, the moment you believe in Jesus, you are a righteous person already.

480
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,980
 That's correct.

481
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,180
 But what Paul is talking about is that one day, that in that final judgment, the day

482
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:01,100
 you see Jesus himself coming back as a King, the day when he's on his throne of judgment,

483
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:09,880
 he will look at you and he will tell you face to face and say, you are my righteousness.

484
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,000
 And he will tell that to you.

485
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,400
 So whatever other people have been trying so hard to work for, you already have it.

486
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,140
 But one day you will have it for full.

487
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,220
 So our righteousness as Christians, just like the kingdom of God that we have always talked

488
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,300
 about is now, but also not yet.

489
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,460
 It's something we already have.

490
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,620
 We are already righteous in God's eyes, but one day we'll hear him say it to us face to

491
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,620
 face.

492
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,820
 We will have the fullness of that righteousness.

493
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:44,060
 And so the old way, they have to go through the works of law to obtain righteousness.

494
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,980
 They fail, Christ is set us free.

495
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,180
 So this is the negative freedom.

496
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:55,020
 But now we know that God has given us through the Holy Spirit, also a positive freedom for

497
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:00,180
 us to overcome the power of sin, for us to love him, for us to love the people around

498
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,180
 us.

499
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,380
 So we will reach this righteousness, to love God with all our heart, souls, and mind and

500
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,380
 strength.

501
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,700
 And we also would love our neighbors as ourself.

502
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:15,320
 We will finally be able to do it through the power of the Holy Spirit in our life.

503
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,380
 But here's the interesting thing.

504
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,660
 The next verse, Paul says, yes, because you're not doing it through the old way.

505
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,700
 So circumcision, uncircumcision, it doesn't matter anyway.

506
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:31,380
 But what matter is a faith that express itself through love.

507
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:38,140
 Or in some other translations, a faith that is working through love.

508
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:44,620
 So Paul is tying this back here, back to the idea of love.

509
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,700
 Let me zoom it out so we can all see this.

510
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,300
 Paul is tying it back to the idea of love.

511
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,540
 And you may be wondering, why did Paul say that?

512
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,980
 And okay, that's the time I have to go back to the slides, say goodbye to this.

513
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,300
 Anybody needs to take one more picture?

514
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,300
 Okay, last one, three, two, one, bye.

515
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
 Okay.

516
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,300
 Thank you, iPad.

517
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,780
 All right, thank you, Apple.

518
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,500
 Let's go back to my notes and let's go back to our slides.

519
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
 Where are we?

520
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,100
 We are at faith expressing itself through this idea of love.

521
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
 Let me talk about it.

522
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,540
 I love to talk about this.

523
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,500
 So here's the interesting part.

524
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,540
 Paul just told us our legalistic work don't matter.

525
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,060
 But what matter is we have a working faith.

526
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:36,340
 So let me highlight the word working for us and unpack it for us.

527
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:42,140
 So yes, I've told you NIV says it's faith expressing itself through love, but more closer

528
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,300
 to the original language translation would be faith working through love.

529
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,780
 And the Greek word that Paul used here is the word anagel, which means to work, to be

530
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,700
 active, to be effective.

531
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,100
 This word may look a little bit familiar to you because that's where the English word

532
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,420
 energy actually comes from.

533
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:06,300
 So it implies the exertion of power, the manifestation of energy, or the accomplishment of an energy

534
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,460
 of a task.

535
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:13,540
 The verb often emphasized the dynamic and effective nature of an action or the result

536
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,200
 it produces.

537
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:23,260
 So Paul is using this word to describe a faith to make a point that genuine faith in Jesus

538
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,740
 Christ is indeed an active faith.

539
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,900
 It's not merely intellectual.

540
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,300
 It's not just some knowledge in our head.

541
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,300
 Real faith should produce actions or results.

542
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,980
 And not only that, when this faith is active, it works through or it expresses itself through

543
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,900
 love.

544
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,860
 Because by this faith, just now I draw that picture for you to explain it.

545
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:55,660
 By this faith, we receive righteousness, the fulfillment of law.

546
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,780
 And what is the fulfillment of law?

547
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,820
 It's love God and love our neighbors.

548
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:07,220
 And this faith also points us back to the source of love himself.

549
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:12,860
 When we truly believe in a God who loves us so much that he's willing to die on our behalf,

550
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:19,300
 when we put our trust in such a God, this faith inside of us, it will be active.

551
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,700
 It will be at work.

552
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,340
 It will produce actions inside of us.

553
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:28,700
 And it produces something or it expresses itself through the same kind of love we have

554
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,540
 received from God, the agape love.

555
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:36,980
 I know some of you may have heard of this fancy Greek word agape, but do you know that

556
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,500
 actually in Greek there are different words to describe the ideas that we would call love

557
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,740
 today?

558
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,140
 For example, there is a word called eros.

559
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,300
 Eros has two characteristics.

560
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,140
 It's a love of the worthy.

561
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,620
 So when someone is worthy, I love him or I love her.

562
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,220
 Maybe, you know, I think Chinese people can relate to this.

563
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:05,620
 If I get like 100 points, 100 marks in my exam, I'm worthy and I receive love.

564
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
 That's eros.

565
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,940
 Like when someone is lovable, when someone is worthy, we love them.

566
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,220
 That's the first characteristics.

567
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:16,580
 The second one is eros is the love that desires to possess.

568
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,820
 You want to own that thing.

569
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,900
 You want to own that person if we love him or her or it.

570
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:28,220
 But the word agape speaks of an idea that is completely opposite.

571
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:33,900
 Agape speaks of a love that is given irrespective of merit.

572
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,580
 Even when you're unworthy, even when you're not lovable, an agape love will still love

573
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,580
 you.

574
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,100
 It's a love that you don't need to earn.

575
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:49,080
 And it's not a love that desires to possess, but on the contrary, it's a love that seeks

576
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,100
 to give.

577
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:57,300
 So we have a God who loves us with a love, not because of who we are, not because we're

578
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:05,900
 worthy or not, not because of our merits or the lack of, but because He is love Himself.

579
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:12,200
 And because of that love, God the Son came into this world as a man or become a man,

580
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,460
 and He allowed Himself to be hung on the cross to suffer a horrible and painful death, and

581
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,860
 He sacrificed Himself for us when we were still sinners, when we were still rejecting

582
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:28,020
 Him, before we tell Him, "Yes, God, I want to follow You," when we were still so broken

583
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,100
 inside.

584
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,940
 His love, it's not one that desire to possess.

585
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,180
 It's a love that seeks to give.

586
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,740
 This is the agape love.

587
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,140
 This is the love of Jesus.

588
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:53,980
 So today, if we truly believe that He loves you with this agape love, your faith, it would

589
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,060
 energize inside of you.

590
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:02,180
 It will express this belief through loving those around you with the exact same kind

591
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,420
 of love that you receive today.

592
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:11,460
 That's why Paul says, "So in your freedom, in your positive freedom that comes from the

593
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:18,580
 empowerment of the Holy Spirit, you have the power to overcome the sinfulness and selfishness

594
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:26,820
 in you so that your faith can start to produce actions of agape love in you."

595
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:33,860
 You, my brothers and sisters, you are called to this kind of freedom.

596
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:39,580
 So do not use this freedom to indulge the flesh.

597
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:46,020
 As your genuine faith in Jesus is expressing itself through this agape self-giving love,

598
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,420
 serve one another.

599
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:55,180
 And serve one another in Paul's original language, it actually means, literally means, "Be each

600
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
 other's slaves."

601
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,420
 Yes, you are set free, you are no longer slave of the law.

602
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:06,940
 But if this genuine faith in Jesus is at work in you that is expressing itself through this

603
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:13,820
 agape love, then be each other's slave.

604
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,220
 Truth bomb, mind blown.

605
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:26,440
 Just as Jesus has given up himself for us, let's give up ourselves for each other.

606
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,740
 We have a freedom to do it.

607
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:35,260
 We have a freedom to choose even when we're hurt, even when people mistreat us, we still

608
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,020
 have a choice, we can choose, we have the power to choose to love.

609
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:45,140
 Even that person is not lovable, even they hate us, even they hurt us, we have this power,

610
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:51,700
 this positive freedom to choose to love when this faith, genuine faith in Jesus is at work

611
00:39:51,700 --> 00:40:01,700
 inside of us and it's for this kind of freedom that Christ has set us free.

612
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,820
 So how are we gonna use our freedom today?

613
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:10,220
 Again, if loving those around you feels more like a do's and don'ts or a requirement from

614
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:16,380
 your pastor, rather than something you really feel compelled in your heart to do, and I

615
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,380
 wanna invite you to just come to the feet of the cross with me because I need that as

616
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:27,700
 well, to just experience the agape love Jesus has for you and me.

617
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:33,420
 I don't want you to strive by your own effort and try to, "Okay, I'll force myself to love

618
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,500
 someone," because that's exactly how we fall away from grace.

619
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:45,140
 Don't strive, just come and receive that agape love of God.

620
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:51,660
 He longs to pour out his love inside of you through his Holy Spirit and he longs to see

621
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,920
 that love start to overflow in our hearts.

622
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,180
 And one day when we see him face to face, he will call us righteous.

623
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:05,380
 He'll say, "You have fulfilled righteousness.

624
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,500
 You know how to love your neighbors.

625
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,400
 You know how to love your God.

626
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,500
 You are righteous because my Holy Spirit has given you the power, has enabled you.

627
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,020
 That faith inside of you has been at work through love.

628
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,360
 You've done it."

629
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,780
 It's not by us trying so hard, it's by just allowing the Holy Spirit to come and start

630
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,080
 his work inside of us.

631
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:38,580
 So put your trust in the one who loves you with an unmerited and sacrificial love.

632
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:46,220
 You can't earn his favor, but you also don't need to earn his favor because of Jesus.

633
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,860
 God's favor, it's already on you today.

634
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,860
 Let us sink it in.

635
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,000
 God's favor is on you today.

636
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 He likes you.

637
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,540
 He doesn't just love you, he likes you because of Jesus.

638
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,620
 He's well pleased with you.

639
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:08,500
 If you ask, if you allow him, he's going to pour out his love through his Holy Spirit

640
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,060
 in you today.

641
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:16,460
 And he wants that love to overflow in you until those around you start to feel your

642
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:23,220
 love and start to feel the same agape love that you received from him.

643
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,340
 How are you going to use your freedom today?

644
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:35,940
 Shall we pray?

645
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:43,060
 Maybe for some of us here in your entire Christian life, loving someone, loving others, it's

646
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:48,420
 been more like a command, something you ought to do, you try hard to do, and you know at

647
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,220
 times you fail and you feel very tired and you feel if you're not doing it, you're in

648
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,220
 trouble.

649
00:42:54,220 --> 00:43:03,140
 That's when we fall away from grace and I just want to invite you back into that grace,

650
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,220
 into just coming to receive the love of God today.

651
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,980
 And just come and receive that.

652
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,940
 See how unworthy we are yet God still loves us.

653
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:20,460
 See how far we have fallen, you know, fallen short of his glory, of his standard of righteousness,

654
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:27,020
 but he still embraces, loves us anyway.

655
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:36,820
 When you can truly open your heart to receive this kind of love, that's when the transformation

656
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,820
 happens.

657
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:43,940
 And I just had a sense that in this room today, there are some of us here in your entire life,

658
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,720
 you have never known this kind of agape or unconditional love.

659
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,780
 In your entire life, people around you, maybe your family, maybe your colleagues, maybe

660
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:57,480
 your friends, the kind of love you receive from them has always been conditional.

661
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,780
 It's always been kind of like an errorous kind of love.

662
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,300
 It's only because you have achieved something, because you are worthy, that's why they love

663
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,980
 you or maybe that's how you're feeling the whole time.

664
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,860
 And so when you come into the presence of God, you are also automatically thinking,

665
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:17,000
 if I don't behave, if I don't perform, is God still going to love me?

666
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,540
 And the answer is yes.

667
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,500
 But maybe you have a hard time believing it, maybe you have a hard time aligning with your

668
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,880
 past experience.

669
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,500
 God is saying, if you are willing to believe, to trust that I'm doing it for you, that that

670
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,740
 is for free, that you don't have to earn my favor, today you're going to experience my

671
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,860
 love through my Holy Spirit.

672
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,740
 If you're willing to do it today, you don't even have to figure everything out in your

673
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:47,980
 head, I invite you just to be open and receive.

674
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:55,180
 You can just repeat this prayer after me and say, "Come Holy Spirit, I believe Jesus is

675
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,080
 enough.

676
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:05,020
 Because of Jesus, because of your death, I can freely receive the fullness of God's love

677
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,980
 today, the agape love.

678
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,460
 So come Holy Spirit, pour out the Father's love in me today."

679
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:37,220
 Just give it a moment, if you're here to receive that.

680
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:42,540
 Father I pray that today we would truly live in your agape love, we will be filled from

681
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,740
 head to toe by it.

682
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:52,620
 And I pray that when we understand what freedom we're called to, when we understand the righteousness

683
00:45:52,620 --> 00:46:01,100
 that we are hoping for, Father I pray that today our faith in you would be at work, would

684
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:07,060
 be active, would energize inside of us, that it would come and change our lives, that the

685
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,300
 Holy Spirit you will come and transform us.

686
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,740
 But I also pray that this faith will be active, our faith will be at work, and we'll be working

687
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,180
 through the agape love.

688
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:24,180
 I pray that this love would overflow inside of us until every single one around us would

689
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,140
 be blessed by it.

690
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,580
 So if you're willing, if that's your prayer as well, I invite you to stand with me today

691
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:37,500
 as we worship, as we sing.

692
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:45,140
 I pray, I pray for a deeper revelation of God's love for us.

693
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,300
 How long, how wide, how deep.

694
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:54,840
 I pray it will be a revelation by the Holy Spirit that you know how much He loves you,

695
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,940
 so that you can start walking in that kind of love and your faith will be working through

696
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,940
 this kind of love today.
