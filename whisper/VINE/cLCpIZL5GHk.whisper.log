[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780]   Father, that's just our prayer right now.
[00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.980]   Father, you would come and pour out upon us.
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.120]   Father, we're so grateful
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.680]   that you're not contained to a building,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.920]   that the home is a sacred place in your heart.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.960]   So Lord, over every home right now,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.680]   Lord, would you pour out your Spirit,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.180]   particularly for us here in Hong Kong in this time.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.480]   God, that song that we just sung is not,
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.080]   it's not just words on a page or lyrics on a screen.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.640]   Father, it's our cry in this moment, in this hour.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.680]   We need revival, Lord.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.320]   And we ask for revival, Lord, to come in our lives,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.200]   a revival for your Word, a revival of repentance, Lord,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840]   where we lay our sin before you,
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.160]   a revival, Lord, of just our hearts, Lord,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.560]   but a revival of those spiritual disciplines
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.120]   that we need to root us in something
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.820]   that is stable in such chaotic times.
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.120]   Lord, a revival of a heart for justice
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.360]   to be able to stand on behalf of the marginalized
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.960]   and the oppressed in this time.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.400]   Lord, a revival in song,
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.160]   that songs would be birthed in our hearts,
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.680]   that melodies would come to us,
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.920]   to be able to declare your goodness and your praises
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.420]   in this time and in this hour.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.000]   Lord, I pray for a revival of love,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.200]   a revival of love that would break down dividing walls,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.320]   that would break those chains that we just sung of,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.920]   a love that would go out from us,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.520]   a love that is greater than the hate
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.960]   that so often can be in us.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.720]   Lord, we just ask for revival of your Spirit.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.240]   Lord, as we lean into what it is today,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.960]   for your Spirit to flow upon your people,
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   to come upon your church, Lord, I wanna pray now
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.480]   for the power of the Spirit to be at work, Lord.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.360]   You know every need of every person watching this.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.880]   You know their circumstance and their situation.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.080]   You know what it is, Lord, that they are facing.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.040]   And so, Lord, I wanna pray for your Spirit to be real.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.860]   Lord, your Spirit, Lord, doesn't guarantee an immediate end
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.160]   to all of the troubles,
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.640]   but it does guarantee the presence of a God
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.480]   right in the midst of them, right here, right now.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.580]   So I wanna pray for that presence, Lord,
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.960]   for your peace, your shalom, your power, your love
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.240]   to be poured out right now on every person
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.640]   that needs it most, Lord.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.140]   The ones that are crying out for more of you,
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.480]   the ones that need for you to shift something
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.000]   in their lives, in their hearts, Lord.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.880]   Would your presence now be there, Lord?
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.200]   And Lord, that's ultimately what we see in the book of Acts.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   We see the pouring out of your Spirit
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.320]   so that your presence would come on earth.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.560]   And Lord, that was your prayer
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.160]   as you taught your disciples how to pray.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.960]   You say, "Pray that the kingdom of God would come on earth
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.080]   "as it is in heaven."
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.360]   And Lord, that's our prayer,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   that your Spirit would fall upon the church in this hour
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.640]   and that you would move upon us, Lord,
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.200]   so that your presence would be known more in Hong Kong
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.000]   than it ever has been before.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.100]   You are Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.120]   Would you come, Lord, and manifest your heart
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.880]   through your church in this city, in this hour.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.120]   And we thank you so much for this.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   In Jesus' name, everyone says, amen, amen.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.640]   What a absolute blessing it is
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.240]   to be able to just gather together,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.520]   even in this time of virtual church, of church everywhere,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.960]   for us to meet like this
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.000]   and just sense God's presence with us.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.960]   I don't know about you, but here in this room,
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.240]   we're here in the auditorium filming this right now.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.440]   And I really felt a deep move of the Spirit of God
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.020]   as we were praying for chains to break,
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.720]   for God's presence to pour out,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   for the church to awaken, for the city to awaken.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.760]   And that is so much what our heart is.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.880]   And actually, so much of what I wanna preach about
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.460]   and talk about with us today,
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.120]   we're continuing our series in Acts
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.960]   that's called "An Unfinished Story."
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.840]   And we're calling it that because it is an unfinished story,
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.000]   that God is still at work today
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.120]   writing this current chapter of the Great Commission,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.920]   writing the current chapter of the church,
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.440]   rising up to walk with people in their hour of need
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.840]   to bring the gospel to those that need it the most.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.780]   That's the reason why we're a part of the story
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.920]   that began in Acts
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.360]   that is still out working through the church today.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.400]   And we, as the church in Hong Kong,
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.180]   both the Vine and the many other churches
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.380]   represented in the city,
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.560]   we get the incredible profound privilege
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.520]   of writing the chapter for this generation.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.280]   And part of that is going to be
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.320]   because the Spirit is upon us and in us.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.840]   And that's what I wanna turn our attention to today
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.560]   as we continue our series.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.320]   I wanna turn to that most famous passage
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.320]   in all of Acts, perhaps, Acts chapter two,
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.760]   where the Holy Spirit falls on the church.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   And I wanna open up this passage for us today
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.800]   in perhaps a different way
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.480]   than what you've experienced before.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.880]   And I wanna actually dig into the roots of this story.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.160]   And those roots are found in the Old Testament.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.960]   And those roots provide so much light for us
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.360]   to understand both what happened in that moment
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.800]   in the first century as the Spirit poured out,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.120]   but perhaps more importantly,
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.660]   for us to be able to understand
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.040]   what God wants to do in this moment.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.400]   'Cause I don't know about you,
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.820]   but we need a fresh Pentecost.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.640]   We need a fresh move of God's Spirit in this hour.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.540]   And I believe as we go through the Scripture together today,
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.320]   you'll get a sense of what that sort of Spirit is like
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.040]   and what we should be praying for,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.080]   for our city in this hour.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.460]   I'm really excited about this.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.720]   Let's open it straight up.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.780]   Acts two, I'm gonna start in verse one.
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.440]   We're gonna read a bunch of the verses.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.020]   When the day of Pentecost came,
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.760]   they were all together in one place.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.500]   Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.480]   came from heaven and lifted the whole house
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.840]   where they were sitting.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.500]   They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.080]   that separated and came to rest on each of them.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.840]   All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.440]   and began to speak in other languages
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.800]   as the Spirit enabled them.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.340]   Now they were staying in Jerusalem,
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.680]   some God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.640]   When they heard this sound,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.880]   a crowd came together in bewilderment or confusion
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.600]   because each one of them heard them speaking
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.520]   in their own language.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.680]   Utterly amazed, they asked one another,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.520]   are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.040]   Then how is it that each of us hears them
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.120]   in our own native language?
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.600]   Parthians, Medes, Elamites, residents of Mesopotamia,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.840]   Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus in Asia,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.880]   Phagyra in Philebia, Egypt and parts of Libya,
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.480]   near Cyrene, visitors from Rome,
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.160]   both Jews and converts to Judaism,
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.680]   Cretans and Arabs, basically everybody
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.440]   that they could basically summarize in that passage.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.080]   We hear them declaring the wonders of God
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.480]   in our own languages.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.840]   Amazed and confused, they asked one another,
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   what does this mean?
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.560]   Some, however, made fun of them.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.560]   Ah, they've had too much wine.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.760]   Then Peter stood up with the 11
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.640]   and raised his voice and addressed the crowd.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.120]   Fellow Jews and all of those who live in Jerusalem,
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.480]   let me actually explain this to you.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.280]   Listen carefully to what I say.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.200]   These men are not drunk as you suppose,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   for it's only nine in the morning.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.320]   It's only nine in the morning.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.720]   I remember when I first read this passage,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.320]   I was a new Christian, I was 19 years old,
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.720]   I was at university.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.320]   And this became one of my favorite passages,
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.840]   not because of the spirit pouring out, that's great,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.880]   but because of that final phrase.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.600]   Peter is standing up in front of the people
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.440]   who all thought the disciples were drunk
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.120]   'cause they were babbling aloud to everybody
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.640]   in their own languages.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.040]   And he says, they're not drunk,
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.080]   it's only nine in the morning.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.440]   And I was 19 at university,
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.840]   and I remember reading that thinking to myself,
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.000]   there are lots of people at university
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.320]   that I know right now who are very likely
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.080]   to still be drunk at nine in the morning.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.760]   So I don't know what it was like in the first century,
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.360]   but in our modern day at university,
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.880]   that was quite a common thing.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.760]   I hope right now that is not a common thing.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.280]   I hope right now you're sober and you're focused on this
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.400]   and we get to open the word of God together.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.880]   There's so much in this story that is so relevant
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.600]   for what the spirit wants to do in and amongst us.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.880]   And in the same way that Peter stood up before the crowd
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.080]   and said, let me explain this to you.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.320]   I wanna just humbly over the next number of minutes,
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.440]   try to explain to you what I think the spirit wants to do
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.440]   in our church here in Hong Kong in 2022.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.080]   To understand the power of this passage,
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.440]   we have to understand its Old Testament roots.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.220]   And Luke invites us into that understanding
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.480]   right in the first verse.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.040]   Let me read this to you again in Acts 2, verse one.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.600]   He says, "When the day of Pentecost came,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.560]   they were all together in one place."
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.520]   He mentions two Old Testament things.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.120]   The first is Pentecost.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.400]   Pentecost was the festival of celebration
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.000]   of the giving of the law on Mount Sinai.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.640]   And that took place always 50 days
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.480]   after the celebration of Passover.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.440]   Passover being that moment when God released Israel
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.880]   from their slavery of Egypt.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.600]   And then 50 days later, they gathered around Mount Sinai.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   And as they gathered around Mount Sinai,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.120]   Moses went up into the cloud of God's fire
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.640]   and God spoke and gave him the law,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.720]   which he then brought down to the people.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.800]   And the law was this really important thing.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.120]   The law wasn't a bunch of rules and obligations
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.800]   and boundaries that was supposed to put a heavy yoke
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.720]   on the people.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.240]   The law was God's way of saying, hey, you are now free.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.000]   I've released you from slavery, now live free.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.040]   And this is how you are to live free amongst you.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.920]   You're to love me with all your heart, mind, soul,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.560]   and strength.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.040]   And you're to love one another.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.560]   And you're to love your neighbors.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.880]   And this is the way to do it.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.640]   Follow this and you will live and you will flourish.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.120]   Now, in the moment, there is this incredible thing
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.040]   that takes place that has a lot to say to the Acts 2 experience.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.600]   I want to just jump to Exodus 19,
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.480]   where that story of the giving of the law at Mount Sinai
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.280]   takes place.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.440]   I just want to read you a few quick verses here
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.440]   to help connect in to what happens in Acts 2.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.160]   This is Exodus 19, starting in verse 16.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.760]   "On the morning of the third day,
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.040]   there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.880]   over the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.680]   Everyone in the camp trembled.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.880]   Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.120]   And they stood at the foot of the mountain.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.480]   Mount Sinai was covered in smoke because the Lord
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.440]   had descended on it in fire."
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.280]   Remember that.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.040]   The Lord has descended on it in fire.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.440]   "The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace,
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.840]   and the whole mountain trembled violently.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.920]   And the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.400]   Then Moses spoke," notice this, "and the voice of God
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.640]   answered him."
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.560]   The Hebrew word for the voice of God
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.600]   here is the word kolot, K-O-L-O-T.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.400]   And that word is actually also the same word
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.720]   that's mentioned right at the start of this passage
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.600]   in verse 16 when it talks about the thunder and the lightning.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.200]   So this word, which is translated a loud voice,
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.440]   can also be translated or used to represent thunder.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.920]   And so what the writer here is trying to get across
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.840]   is that God spoke on that day.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.720]   When the law went out, God spoke.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.400]   And his voice was like thunder.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.520]   It was this loud voice that everyone could hear.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.320]   In fact, rabbis writing in the Talmud
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.560]   and teaching through the Talmud many years later,
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.080]   still up to this day, they teach something very important
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.160]   about this moment.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   They say in the thunder of God's voice,
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.520]   God spoke in 70 languages at once,
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.400]   70 being the idea of perfection, being
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.000]   the idea of all of the languages of the earth.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.880]   And so Jewish people understand that at Pentecost,
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.600]   there was this outworking of God's voice
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.440]   in multiple languages so people could understand the law.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.160]   So as the disciples are gathered there
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.320]   in the upper room in Acts chapter 2,
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.560]   celebrating the Passover, they would
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.760]   have been celebrating that kind of idea,
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.040]   that God has the ability to speak to all people.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.400]   Let's go back to Acts 2 then and look at the Second Old
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.560]   Testament reference, just from that first verse.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.360]   When the day of Pentecost came, they were-- here it is--
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.080]   all together in one place.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.000]   Now on the surface, that just sounds like Luke
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.200]   is explaining that, hey, everybody
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.040]   is gathered together in the upper room, all 120 of them.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   Well, actually, it means more than that.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.600]   Luke uses a specific Greek phrase,
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.000]   "all together in one place," which
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.440]   is the exact phrase that's only found in one
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.760]   other place in the Old Testament, the Greek version
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.000]   of the Old Testament.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.600]   The Greek version of the Old Testament
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.440]   was in circulation at the time of this moment in Acts chapter
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.280]   2.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.760]   And the place where that phrase is found,
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.600]   and the only other place in the Bible,
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.200]   is in the story of the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.280]   I want to take us to that story now,
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.800]   because that has something to say to us about Acts chapter 2.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.440]   This is Genesis 11, verses 1.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.480]   By the way, I love this in scripture.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.720]   I hope you're loving this too.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.480]   I love just digging into the Bible, connecting things,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.080]   helping us to see the bigger picture.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.520]   And if you stick with me, I think
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.640]   you're going to see the big picture here.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.480]   Genesis 11, verse 1.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.920]   "Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.680]   As men or people moved eastward, they
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.400]   found a plain in Shinar, and there they
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.920]   were all together in one place."
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.200]   There it is, the same phrase, "all together in one place."
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.400]   So when Luke writes this about the disciples in Acts chapter
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.800]   2, he's trying to connect that moment back to here,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.160]   to the Tower of Babel.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.040]   Now, we don't have time to read the whole of Genesis 11
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.800]   right now.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.720]   Let me summarize basically the story.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.880]   It might be familiar to many of you.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.560]   Up until this point in humanity's growth
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.920]   and humanity's development, there was just one language,
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.800]   one tongue.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.120]   And here, the God's people had gathered all together
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.480]   in one place, but they were about to do
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.160]   two things that were in rebellion to God's word.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.560]   This is not a proud moment for humanity.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.280]   This is a moment where they continue
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.480]   to rebel in their sin against all that God has done.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.040]   And they do two things to do that.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.000]   The first is that they decide to build a tower.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.160]   They want to build this massive construct
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.800]   to be able to reach into the heavens.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.440]   Why?
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.840]   Because they believe if they could get into the heavens,
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.000]   they would become God.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.960]   See, humanity at this point wasn't
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.800]   satisfied with just being the image of God.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.320]   They wanted to be God themselves.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.320]   They wanted to be in the heavens so they
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.280]   could take the power of heaven and have
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.600]   dominion over themselves.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.520]   Fascinating.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.880]   This is the same temptation, the same sin
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.640]   that actually led Adam and Eve into the original sin.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.760]   If you remember in the garden in Genesis 3,
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.400]   that temptation from the enemy was
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.240]   to take the fruit so that they could become God,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.760]   so that they could be God themselves.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.040]   That same temptation is now happening all over again
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.920]   as they decide to build this tower.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.560]   And they do this in a false sense of unity.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.120]   Let's all gather together in one place.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.160]   Let's do this now so that we can see God
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.520]   and actually become like God.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.680]   That's the first thing.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.760]   Here's the second thing.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.000]   It's found in verse 4 of Genesis chapter 11.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.120]   Let me read this to us.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.720]   "Then they said this, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city,"
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.680]   there it is, "with a tower that reaches to the heavens
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.040]   so that we may make a name for ourselves,"
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.000]   now notice this, "and not be scattered over the face
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.120]   of the whole earth."
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.760]   The primary thing that God spoke over humanity in its creation
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.080]   in Genesis 1 and 2 was that they were to be fruitful,
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.000]   to be blessed, and to go out and to be scattered
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.720]   over all the earth, subduing the earth, flourishing it,
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.600]   being God's helper to help to flourish all of creation
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.360]   and bring it into its utmost shalom.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.320]   That was God's command for humanity in Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.880]   one of the primary things he had created humanity for.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.960]   And now here in Genesis 11,
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.800]   God's people are not just rebelling against God
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.320]   because they wanna be God,
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.680]   they're rebelling against God's demanded
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.160]   and created destiny for humanity,
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.320]   which is to go into the world, subdue it,
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.560]   and to flourish it and bring it into shalom.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.360]   They're standing against the very cool
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.680]   that God had given humanity right there at the start.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.000]   And they say, "No, we're gonna stay here all in one place,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.620]   build a tower so that we are not scattered over the earth,
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.720]   so that we're not spread out all over the place,
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.480]   defying the very thing that God wanted."
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.560]   See, this whole Babel and narrative
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.040]   is basically humanity fighting against God,
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.400]   trying to say, "We can do it ourselves, we don't need him.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.840]   All we need is to be him, we can dominion ourselves,
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.720]   and we're gonna stand against the very cooling
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.240]   that is upon us in our creation and not spread out,
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.080]   but stay in this sense of unity together."
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.400]   I want you to see why this is such an affront to God.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.880]   You see, God wanted a free and diverse people
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.200]   scattered across all the earth,
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.320]   kind of taking his values and his image,
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.640]   representing his values and his image.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.880]   Babel wanted a unified, homogenized group of people
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.800]   in one place, representing their own values
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.600]   and their own image.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.680]   So you can see the depth of how this is rebelling
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.960]   against the very thing that God wants.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.560]   And because of this, God in Genesis 11 comes down.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.280]   I love when it says that he comes down,
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.480]   they're building this big high tower,
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:42.480]   but he comes down to them and he confuses their speech.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.600]   He does this because he knows that with one tongue,
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.000]   they will be able to work together
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.060]   in this false sense of unity and try to build this tower.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.760]   So he confuses their tongue, their language
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.440]   into multiple languages,
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.680]   so they wouldn't be able to work in cohesion together.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.120]   Confusion sits at the center of the Babel story.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   In fact, Babel comes from the Hebrew word for confusion.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.440]   It's also the same word in English that we get for Babel.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.040]   If you ever heard anyone say, "I couldn't understand
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.800]   "a word they said, it was like they were babbling."
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.560]   Well, that comes from this same story.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.280]   And so God comes and he judges them,
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.080]   curses them by giving them these multiple languages.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.720]   But here's the fascinating thing,
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.640]   in that God actually is blessing them
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.920]   'cause he's actually moving them back
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.800]   into the very thing that he'd always called humanity to.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.080]   And that was to scatter around the earth
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.720]   and to bring that diversity to see the world flourish.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.480]   And so in bringing that confusion to language,
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.520]   God stops the building of the tower,
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.400]   but he also facilitates his very destiny for humanity,
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.680]   spreading them out over all the earth.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.840]   Now, both that Pentecost context and the Babel context
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.200]   is exactly what we need to have in our mind
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.320]   as we come back to our story in Acts chapter two.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.480]   Let me now connect some of these dots for you
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.760]   and show you this in the scripture.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.460]   I think this will blow your mind.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.520]   Genesis, sorry, Acts two, verse one onwards.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.640]   Let me read this to us again.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.720]   "When the day of Pentecost came,
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.120]   they were all together in one place.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.800]   Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind."
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.600]   It's the same concept of the thunder
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.360]   that took place on the top of Mount Sinai.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.080]   "Came from heaven and filled the whole house
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.400]   where they were all sitting.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.120]   They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire."
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.920]   Again, connection to Sinai,
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.860]   the idea of the fire falling on God's people.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.500]   "That separated and came to rest on each of them.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.380]   All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.180]   and began to speak in other languages."
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.660]   All of them, there it is again.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.380]   "They'd all gathered around the base of Mount Sinai,
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.740]   all of them to hear the word."
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.820]   Here they are, all of them together again.
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.680]   "And they speak in other languages."
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.860]   Where Babel had confused language,
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.900]   here now they're speaking
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.100]   in these multiple different languages.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.560]   Let's carry on, verse five.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.300]   "Now they were staying in Jerusalem,
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.980]   God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven."
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.320]   Notice this, every nation under heaven.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.340]   This is the outworking of that Babel moment
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.300]   where they were scattered around the world.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.100]   Well, here in Acts 2,
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.920]   that scattering is being brought back together
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.540]   as all the nations of the earth are there.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.020]   Verse six, "When they heard this sound,
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.860]   a crowd came together in confusion."
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.900]   There's that idea of confusion linked back to Babel.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.500]   "Because each one heard them speaking
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.920]   in their own language."
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.180]   All right, here it is, speaking in their own language.
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.420]   What's happening in Acts chapter two
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.540]   is the significant outworking of what took place
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.660]   in Exodus 19 with the original Sinai moment
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.540]   and in Genesis 11 with Babel.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.920]   In fact, this is the undoing of Babel.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.180]   This is God stepping into human history
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.140]   and reversing all that he had done in that Babel moment.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.420]   For in Babel, where humanity rebelled against him,
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.100]   wanted to become him,
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.980]   wanted to not live out the destiny
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.740]   that he had called them to,
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.460]   God comes down and confuses their language
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.780]   so that they weren't able to be able to be working together.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.620]   Now in Acts chapter two,
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.140]   as God decides to start the church,
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.700]   how does he birth that church?
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.980]   He pours out his spirit
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.340]   so those that were once opposed to one another
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.220]   are now able to come back together again.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.780]   What God is doing is undoing that curse of Genesis 11
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.860]   and restating this for the church.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.560]   Basically at the birth of the church,
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.140]   he's drawing a line in the sand
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.980]   and saying this is what the church is gonna be about.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.020]   The church is gonna be a place where the gospel,
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.120]   my word is gonna be now be able to be understood
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.220]   by people from every language, every culture,
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.860]   every background, every diverse person
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.860]   is going to be able to hear the gospel
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.300]   in their own language.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.940]   The purpose of the church is to take the word of God
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.980]   and to bring it into the cultures of this world
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.100]   with the hope of Jesus.
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.300]   And here's the fascinating thing.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.260]   In Sinai, what you see in that story
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.680]   is a voice of God in all of those 70 languages
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.360]   going out and speaking God's law to people.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.100]   What we have now in this moment
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.820]   is God writing his law on human hearts.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.940]   No longer tablets of stone, but now human hearts.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.020]   And God once again speaks his voice over all people,
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.900]   but it's different this time.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.580]   In Acts chapter two, that voice comes through
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.420]   the individual members of the church,
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.360]   of that gathered group of people in the upper room.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.780]   This is no longer the thunder that's happening in the clouds.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.340]   This is no longer one person having to go up
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.860]   to the top of a mountain to understand God.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:57.040]   Now God's word is coming out through the church,
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.180]   through his people.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.780]   And when I say that, I'm not talking about Andrew Gardner,
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.500]   the senior pastor of a church or any other senior pastor.
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.620]   I'm talking about the people of the church,
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.740]   the men and the women in that moment
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.620]   who were gathered there in the upper room
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.300]   became by the spirit of God,
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.100]   the mouthpiece of God to a broken world.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.700]   And I want you to hear this today.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.700]   When we pray for a spirit-filled church in 2022,
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.420]   what we're actually praying for is that you would become
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.820]   a mouthpiece for the word of God in your sphere of influence,
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.460]   that you would become someone who is so filled
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.940]   with the spirit of God that you get to share
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.620]   the goodness of God, his law, his freedom, his love,
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:41.020]   his mercy, all the things that are in God's heart
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.800]   with the people that God has placed around you.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.180]   What happens in Acts two is God basically saying,
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.260]   this is the way the church will be.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.500]   Not one or two special people with some special voice,
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.180]   but my whole body infused by my spirit,
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:02.500]   able to now speak my word out into the world.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.340]   What an encouragement that is for us.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.260]   What that means is that church is this community,
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.560]   this body together at work,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.900]   believing together that God is at work in us.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.220]   See, what's happening in Acts chapter two
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.340]   is not some sort of gift of the Holy Spirit
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.020]   for a special group of people.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.780]   It's God saying, this is the way the church will be.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.100]   And it's almost as if God is basically saying this,
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.740]   open up your mouths, loosen your tongues,
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:37.740]   and speak out the beauty of my gospel for the time is now.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:42.460]   So how do we take all of this and apply it to Hong Kong,
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.740]   apply it to the divine, apply it to who we are
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.580]   in this moment?
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.500]   What is Acts two saying to us?
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.860]   What should we be praying for?
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.940]   Well, the first thing it says to us is reconciliation.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.460]   The whole point of Acts chapter two
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.900]   is that all of these different nations
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.580]   now gathered in Jerusalem in this moment
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.220]   are able to hear the gospel,
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.100]   hear the reconciling work of Jesus,
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.580]   his death and resurrection,
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.400]   reconciling us through our broken relationship with God,
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.780]   restoring that relationship
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.500]   so we can be in relationship with him again.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.940]   Reconciling us, not just with God, but with one another
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.300]   so that we can love him
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.120]   with all of our heart, mind, soul and strength,
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.020]   but also love our neighbor as ourselves.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.260]   And you gotta remember that in Acts chapter two,
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.620]   all of these different nations that were represented,
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.280]   they didn't get on with one another.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.900]   They had issues with one another.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.580]   There was hatred and division.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.740]   There was divide,
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.100]   'cause that is what happened in Genesis 11.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.460]   But here is God by his spirit saying,
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.500]   this is what my church is gonna be about.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.420]   If my church stands for anything,
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.420]   it has to stand for this, reconciliation.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.860]   Through the love of Christ,
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.260]   through the power of the spirit,
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.420]   my church gets the great privilege
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.540]   of taking the hands of those that are broken,
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.700]   of those that are divided against each other
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.180]   and bringing them back together again.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.060]   And what a message that is for us here in Hong Kong.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.700]   Oh, how we need the spirit of God
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.000]   to pour out in this city in this hour,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.180]   to bring together those that are divided.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.080]   I mean, think about it.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.740]   We need the spirit of God so much
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.900]   to see the Hong Kong Chinese and the mainland Chinese
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.020]   come back together in a place of love and respect.
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.940]   We need the spirit of God to be at work in our city
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.180]   so that those that are politically divided at this time,
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.420]   so that those families
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.340]   that can't talk to each other anymore,
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.160]   those people that can't be in the same room
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.180]   as that other person,
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.800]   those ones that have been deeply hurt
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.540]   by the actions of another
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.180]   can find through the love of Christ
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.600]   the ability to be reconciled with the other person.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.220]   Oh, how we need the spirit to move upon our city,
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.720]   to move upon the church
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.960]   so that we can stand against racism
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.920]   in every single one of its forms
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   so that anyone who is marginalized,
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.440]   who is set aside, who is seen as the other,
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.760]   who is brought down,
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.040]   who is seen as less of a human being than another person,
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.260]   the church could stand up with a loosened tongue
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.600]   in its mouth and stand for justice
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.580]   and stand against the ways
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.900]   in which humanity is still trying to separate people
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.760]   and instead see through the power of God,
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.760]   unity and reconciliation come again.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.320]   What a privilege this is.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.600]   That's a spirit-filled church, my friends.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.880]   A spirit-filled church is not defined actually
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.600]   by whether the members of that church
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.200]   are manifesting some sort of gift of the spirit or not.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.600]   Acts 2 teaches us this,
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.360]   that a spirit-filled church
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.080]   is a church that defends the poor,
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.520]   that stands for justice,
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.000]   that actually ministers in reconciliation
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.520]   for those that are opposed to one another.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.360]   That's what a spirit-filled church is.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.440]   When I pray for the vine to be filled with the spirit,
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.920]   of course, I want the gifts of the spirit amongst us.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.800]   And we pray for that here at the vine all the time.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.880]   But when we're actually praying in line with Acts 2,
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.560]   what we're praying for is the breaking down
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.100]   of dividing walls and a reconciliation
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.520]   to come upon our city like never before.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.840]   That, my friends, is a spirit-filled church,
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   one that can reach out in love to broken and divided people
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.300]   and a church that can deal with the broken
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.300]   and divisions within itself as well.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.500]   This is a word for us as much as it is
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.120]   for us to bring together those divided outside of us.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.160]   We need to work hard to make sure
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.000]   that there aren't divisions in our own midst.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.860]   Within the walls of the church,
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.880]   there are many things that divide us.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   And we, if we pray for the spirit like in Acts 2,
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.240]   we stand on behalf of unity.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.760]   This is why I love the fact that right now here in Lent,
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   we're doing the One Campaign,
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.220]   the One Hearing the Word Campaign.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.520]   This campaign has been put together
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.940]   by multiple different churches in the city,
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.760]   Chinese churches, international churches,
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.680]   different backgrounds, denominations,
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.800]   different beliefs even about the spirit
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.000]   and other things like that.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.180]   These churches have come together to put together
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.780]   a reading plan and a devotional plan in unity together.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.080]   That's a beautiful picture of what reconciliation
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.880]   and the power of the spirit can look like upon the church.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.520]   If you're not doing this, you can go onto your app store,
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.800]   download One Hearing the Word HK, get it on your phone,
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.600]   and you can continue to join with many others
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.920]   in the city right now in an act of unity,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.960]   of listening to the scriptures together
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.400]   so that we might be a unified body
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.440]   offering reconciliation in this hour.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.280]   The other thing we see here that we can definitely apply
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.480]   to our context and situation is the beauty
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.920]   and the importance of cultural diversity.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.000]   In Acts 2, what we see here is God speaking out.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.640]   And like I say, almost reversing Babel,
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   but another way of thinking about it is not reversing it
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.360]   'cause reversing Babel would be like
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.880]   taking everybody's language and bringing us back
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.080]   to one language and one common tongue.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.160]   Rather than reversing Babel, what God does here
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.540]   is actually overcomes the curse
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.280]   by bringing his word in multiple languages.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.840]   In other words, he doesn't get rid of the multiple languages.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.040]   He doesn't try to push humanity back to one culture,
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.000]   back to one language.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.600]   No, God celebrates the beauty of human diversity
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.580]   and variety, and he celebrates it by speaking the gospel
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.040]   in their culture, through their language.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.000]   That's the beauty.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   He doesn't try to reduce culture, reduce language,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.280]   reduce customs.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.200]   No, he celebrates the diversity by bringing his word
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.720]   in multiple cultures and contexts.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.860]   This is something that the church has not always gotten right
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.100]   in church history.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.280]   We just have to look at the Crusades and the power
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.740]   and the way in which the church has colonized
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.420]   many other countries, trying to get those countries
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.080]   to be more like the Western culture,
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.960]   more like a white person's culture, if you will,
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.360]   rather than actually recognizing and honoring
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.120]   the culture of the homeland.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.680]   What we see here in Acts 2 is God honoring culture diversity
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.480]   but also bringing the gospel within that cultural diversity.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.280]   See, we are to take the gospel not by force,
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.680]   not with the sword, not with violence,
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.480]   not trying to change other cultures
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.360]   to become like the culture of the West.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.000]   We're to take the gospel, which is the kingdom culture,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.840]   not some white culture or some Western culture,
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.040]   the kingdom culture, and plant that as a seed
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.840]   in the soil of every culture.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.040]   And God waters that seed and he brings the conversion
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.240]   and the transformation of people's lives
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.400]   within their unique, beautiful culture.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.820]   That's what we see here in Acts 2.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.720]   God's celebrating that diversity and yet speaking his gospel
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.080]   and his hope and his life into it.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.400]   And we as a church, if we are wanting a spirit-filled
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.960]   Acts moment right now, what we're actually saying
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.080]   is that we will continue to be a church
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.080]   that deconstructs any attempt to try to homogenize people,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.680]   try to make people all the same, think the same,
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.080]   look the same, act the same.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.400]   And instead, we would stand for the kingdom values
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.000]   that God has for the church,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.160]   values that see the beauty and the richness and diversity
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:16.160]   in cultural experiences, and that is enabled to build
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.960]   a church of multiple culture but one heart.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.920]   Listen, multiple culture, one heart.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.080]   Multiple culture, one story.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.740]   Multiple cultures but kingdom values.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.120]   That's what we see happening in Acts 2.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.040]   That's what we get called to here.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.480]   And you know, here at the Vine, I've been so grateful
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.680]   to our asylum seeker and refugee community
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.280]   and how they brought this diversity amongst us.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.480]   You know, people often say that the Vine has done so much
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.360]   for that community, but we here at the Vine always say
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.720]   that that community has done way more for us.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.520]   The fact that they have been amongst us,
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.560]   sharing their language, their backgrounds, their cultures,
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.240]   whether from Africa, from Southeast Asia,
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.280]   from the Middle East, we've been so blessed
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.760]   to be able to worship on a Sunday
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.440]   when we gather in person here
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.360]   and see that multicultural environment that we have
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.440]   because of the wonder of our asylum seekers.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.380]   We must, as a church, continue to promote that diversity.
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.880]   We must be looking to break down divided walls
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.560]   between cultures and backgrounds.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.060]   And things like what we see when others try
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.560]   to create one culture, when others try
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.640]   to dominate another culture through aggression,
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.960]   what we're seeing right now in Ukraine,
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.660]   we have to stand against that in prayer, stand against it,
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.600]   because we believe that actually there is beauty
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.560]   and the gospel will be found in every language group
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.120]   and every culture, and that's a good, beautiful thing.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.160]   So what does it mean for us to be a spiritful church?
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.040]   How do we take Acts 2, apply it to our lives?
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.640]   Well, it means that we want to pray for this reconciliation,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.420]   both in our own lives, in our own hearts,
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.420]   with those that we are the other towards,
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.040]   but also so that we can model what that reconciliation
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.880]   looks like in Hong Kong in 2022.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.280]   And it means that we can continue to stand
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.240]   for the beautiful diversity that we see in Hong Kong,
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.800]   that we see in this city,
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.920]   that we can really honour that diversity
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.140]   and see within our churches the model
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:15.160]   of people from different languages and cultures
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:19.560]   and backgrounds, yet finding unity through the life,
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.840]   death and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.560]   It's the gospel that unifies us,
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.560]   and we come together in that.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.800]   You see, the unity of the spirit is not found
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.680]   in monoculture, it's found in the beauty
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.360]   and the celebration of human variety.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.760]   That's who we are, and we should pray into that,
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.180]   speak into it and believe it.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.900]   And when we ask for the spirit to come upon us,
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.660]   that's what we should expect,
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.420]   a heart to reconcile with the other
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.380]   and a heart to celebrate the beautiful variety
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.640]   that we see within our humanity.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.580]   I wanna pray for that over us right now
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.580]   and speak that word of life into us.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:00.860]   Let's pray.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.500]   Father, we are so grateful for this passage from Acts 2.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.940]   So grateful for the way in which you poured out your spirit
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.680]   at the starting point, the birthing point of the church,
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.780]   and brought that church into a place
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.620]   where they could understand the importance of reconciliation,
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.160]   that these Galileans could speak the gospel
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.860]   in the languages of all of the world.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.220]   Galileans who at one point had been distrustful of Gentiles,
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.380]   who had been taught to stay away from them.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.540]   Now they were beginning to see that God's heart
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.140]   was always to bless every nation,
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:39.620]   to bring all of those nations under His culture,
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.020]   the kingdom culture.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.340]   And Father, as we look at Hong Kong in this hour,
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.540]   we wanna pray that you would break down our dividing walls.
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.460]   Lord, we recognize that in the last three years,
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.460]   there has been so much that has created division
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.340]   in this city.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.580]   There is so much still to this day that creates division.
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.260]   Lord, would you break our hearts?
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.040]   Would your spirit move upon your church
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.860]   to be a reconciling body, to be a body of justice,
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.300]   to stand on behalf of the marginalized,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.300]   to stand on behalf of the cultures that are being oppressed
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.420]   and be able to bring voice, Lord,
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.380]   to those that need it the most.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.100]   Lord, would we reconcile those
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.620]   that are opposed to one another?
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.060]   And would it be done not through some great words
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.340]   or through some great theory or strategy,
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.580]   but through your spirit and through your love.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.060]   And Lord, we pray for that beautiful diversity.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.000]   We thank you for the incredible cultures
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.820]   that you've created in this world
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.380]   that speak so beautifully of who you are.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.900]   And Lord, we ask that the gospel now would come
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.380]   to every tribe, every language group.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.300]   We're thankful that in Revelations,
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.900]   we get that picture of every tribe, every culture,
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.020]   every language bowing before you.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:53.220]   Again, not one tribe, not one culture, not one language,
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.620]   beautiful diversity standing before you.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.540]   Lord, I pray that the vine and the churches in our city
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.740]   would stand on behalf of that diversity today,
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.780]   that we would look at those diverse groups
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.420]   that are perhaps marginalized,
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.820]   maybe the ethnic minorities in our midst,
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:11.020]   and we would be a church that would reach out towards them
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.860]   and help walking with them in times that are difficult.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.620]   Lord, that we would honor all cultures,
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.100]   honor all backgrounds,
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.460]   recognizing that your gospel is at work
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.300]   amongst all your people.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.140]   And that we would do this not for our glory, but for yours.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.940]   Lord, fill us with your spirit, Lord.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.380]   We need it now more than ever.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.380]   If we're gonna be a church of evangelism in 2022,
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.740]   may it be reconciliation,
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:42.060]   and may it be to all of the beautiful cultures
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.740]   that you've placed around us.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.260]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.300]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.240]   Amen, let's go into a time of worship
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.720]   as we begin to really sing out for that spirit to come,
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.500]   to break down those dividing walls,
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.340]   to change our lives and our hearts,
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.300]   and to be able to walk out this message,
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.740]   not just hear a message,
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.920]   but actually walk it out in our day-to-day lives.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.460]   Let's worship now together.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.820]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
