1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 Welcome to The Vine if you're new here.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,280
 My name is Andrew.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,680
 I'm one of the pastors here.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,000
 Welcome if you're online with us right now.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,080
 We're so grateful that you join us.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,280
 Some of you join us each and every week from around the world online.

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,120
 We're so glad you're here.

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,640
 Welcome to everybody in the overflow outside.

9
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,880
 We know we've got a packed overflow outside as well.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,680
 It's great to have you with us.

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,400
 If you're new to The Vine, you may not know who I am.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,920
 You may not know where I'm from.

13
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,280
 I have a weird accent.

14
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,600
 And when I talk, people, if they don't know me, they're like, they don't listen to a word

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,800
 of what I say for 20 minutes.

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,480
 They just try to work out, is he American?

17
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480
 Is he Australian?

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,480
 Like, where is he from?

19
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,960
 Actually, that question, where am I from, is one that has caused me a lot of stress

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,200
 and anxiety over my life.

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,040
 It's actually the question that I have struggled to answer probably the most in my life.

22
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,040
 I wonder whether anyone else here might resonate with that idea.

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,640
 I was actually born in the UK.

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,280
 I lived there for seven years, but then I left the UK and I lived in the US.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,880
 And I lived in America for four years, some of the most formative years as a kid from

26
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,880
 seven to about the age of 11.

27
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,040
 And at the age of 11, I came to Hong Kong and moved here with my family and have been

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,140
 here for 36 years.

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,320
 And so the interesting thing for me is that I've been in Hong Kong for 36 years, so in

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,840
 a way, Hong Kong is home, but the reality is I actually don't speak Cantonese.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,320
 I know, shocking and shameful.

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,720
 I don't speak Cantonese after 36 years.

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,640
 The reality also is, if I'm honest with you, is that I'm not actually deeply immersed in

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,120
 super local Cantonese culture.

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,360
 And part of that is because I was raised in an international schooling system here and

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,560
 I've actually, for whatever reason, have for the majority of my life lived in districts

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,160
 of Hong Kong that are generally favoured by expatriates or international people.

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,040
 So some of my local friends, when I tell them I'm a Hong Konger, they just smile at me and

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,320
 pat me on the back and kind of go, "No, you're not.

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
 No, you're not.

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
 No, you're not."

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,760
 Whereas some of my other local friends who know my heart and have seen my life over the

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,160
 last 36 years are like, "You are absolutely a Hong Konger."

44
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,000
 And so the question I often grapple with is, "Who actually am I?

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Am I British?"

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
 Well, my passport tells me so.

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,760
 "Am I a Hong Konger?"

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,920
 My heart tells me so.

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,520
 The reality is I probably exist somewhere between the two of those realities.

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,440
 I'm a classic third culture kid.

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,480
 I would imagine there's a bunch of others in the room online right now who would resonate

52
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
 with that.

53
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,200
 I was born in one culture.

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,120
 I grew up in another culture.

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,040
 And over that, I've kind of gotten lost between those two cultures.

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,680
 And I've had to try to work out, "Well, who exactly am I?"

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
 And to take the best of one culture and the best of another culture and try to bring those

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
 things together.

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,040
 But if I'm honest with you, I think the way that a lot of third culture kids feel is you

60
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,260
 just feel kind of adrift on an ocean of cultural and national identity that you never really

61
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,320
 feel like you're settling into.

62
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,480
 You never really feel like you've got an anchor point that you can kind of put down in any

63
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,720
 place where you can find some roots and you long to find a home.

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,800
 You long to have a group of people where you generally feel like you fully fit into and

65
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,560
 are, interestingly and importantly, fully embraced by those people.

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,700
 It's funny, my wife Christine, she'll often say to me, "Andrew, you're a chameleon when

67
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,840
 it comes to culture.

68
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,040
 You have an amazing ability to adapt to the color of the majority culture that you're

69
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,160
 finding yourself operating in in that moment."

70
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,320
 If I'm around a bunch of Americans, I start sounding more American.

71
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,280
 If I'm with Australians, I become...

72
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,520
 You can't even understand what I'm saying.

73
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,640
 If I'm with Australians, because it's Australians.

74
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
 Had to do it.

75
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
 Had to do it.

76
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,800
 But I have this amazing ability to sort of adapt to whatever majority culture I'm around

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,880
 because I'm desperately trying to find people that will accept me.

78
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,640
 And in fact, one of the biggest questions, I think, of my adult life has always been

79
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:10,640
 who exactly are my people and will I ever fit in?

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,280
 And as we continue our Exodus journey and we get to the midway point of the second chapter,

81
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,760
 that's exactly what is going on for Moses.

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:26,640
 Moses is in a growing tension of an identity crisis.

83
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,400
 He's wondering, "Who really are my people and where do I fit in?"

84
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,840
 We saw last week that Moses born to a Levite family, so Hebrew in his blood and origin

85
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
 in that sense.

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,920
 But at a young age, he's put in a basket and sent off down the Nile River and Pharaoh's

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,080
 daughter from the Egyptian culture finds him and adopts him into her family.

88
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,960
 Now God, because He's incredible and miraculous and does all these amazing things, manages

89
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,880
 to get Moses back to his biological mother who gets the joy of nursing him.

90
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,720
 Scholars think that that took place over probably three to four years.

91
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,760
 So for three or four years, Moses was back in his Hebrew family, biological family.

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,500
 And I'm sure during that time, his mother and father and everybody else around immersed

93
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,000
 him in the Hebrew culture, helped him to understand what it meant to be a believer in a monotheistic

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,360
 God, the father of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph, to help him to journey in the

95
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,280
 understanding of what it meant to be a person, a part of the people of God.

96
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,280
 But then at the age of three or four, his mother takes him back and hands him back to

97
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,920
 Pharaoh's daughter, who from that point forward raises him as her own son.

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,600
 And just as if Moses had been taken and drawn out of the waters of the Nile, he's now taken

99
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,640
 and drawn out of his Hebrew culture and he's placed into a different culture.

100
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,680
 And he grows up now immersed around that culture as a prince within the Egyptian royal courts.

101
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,080
 Now interestingly, fascinatingly, Moses, who's writing the book of Exodus, doesn't tell us

102
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,720
 anything about that time, almost as if maybe he's embarrassed to talk about it.

103
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,400
 But he doesn't mention anything about it.

104
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,000
 In fact, we have to look outside of the book of Exodus to find any commentary about what

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,560
 it was like for Moses that time.

106
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,640
 There are some commentary in the rest of the scriptures and also external to scripture

107
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,840
 in history.

108
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,240
 Let me just give you some examples.

109
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,400
 Acts chapter seven is the story of Stephen standing before the Sanhedrin, his power,

110
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,240
 authority of his people in the day, the Jewish people.

111
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,040
 And he's fighting for his life and he's fighting for his life by telling them the story of

112
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
 his people.

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,120
 And he goes right back to Abraham and he works through.

114
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,000
 And of course, he speaks about Moses.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,840
 Let me read you from Acts seven, verse 21.

116
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,840
 He says, "When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her

117
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,440
 own son.

118
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,840
 Moses was educated in the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action."

119
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,160
 We get a little glimpse right there.

120
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,280
 Moses understandably was raised in the educational system of Egypt, but not just the educational

121
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
 system.

122
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,480
 He's remembering he's in the royal court.

123
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,320
 And you can do some research here and find out what it was like to be educated in the

124
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,920
 royal court of that time.

125
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,560
 Moses would have received the best education in the world at that time.

126
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,120
 He would have been taught maths.

127
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,320
 He would have been taught political discourse and political history.

128
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,680
 He would have been taught military strategies.

129
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,760
 He would have been taught languages, architecture, a whole bunch of different things.

130
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
 Philosophy.

131
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,360
 He would have been taught importantly about the Egyptian religious system and how all

132
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,160
 of the spiritual deities of Egypt work.

133
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,760
 All of this would have been his education.

134
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,760
 And Stephen tells us here, "He was powerful in speech and deed."

135
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,320
 So he was good at what he had learned.

136
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,200
 He'd learn all this stuff and it had become a part of who he was.

137
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,480
 Interestingly, the first century historian, Josephus, also writes about Moses in this

138
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,520
 time.

139
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,960
 And he tells us two things.

140
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,160
 One, that Moses was being groomed by Pharaoh to take over as Pharaoh in Egypt.

141
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,520
 Now it's likely that the Pharaoh of the time of the Exodus did not have his own son.

142
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,120
 And although Moses was adopted by Pharaoh's daughter, it looks like through history that

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,880
 actually Moses and Pharaoh almost became a father-son kind of relationship.

144
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,160
 And this father figure over Moses was grooming him to take over the running of Egypt.

145
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,680
 The second thing that Josephus tells us is that Moses actually had led a military conquest,

146
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,240
 a victorious military conquest in Ethiopia in that time.

147
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,880
 So I want you to understand something really important here.

148
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,440
 Moses being adopted into Pharaoh's family doesn't mean that Moses was like the embarrassing

149
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,720
 third uncle that you kind of wish never came to the Christmas party and you're kind of

150
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 embarrassed about him.

151
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,800
 Moses wasn't some Hebrew that was embarrassing to the family and they kind of shoved him

152
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,040
 off in the side during all the important events.

153
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:54,840
 Moses was centered into the powerful, oppressive work of the Egyptian empire.

154
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,680
 He was being groomed to be Pharaoh.

155
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,880
 Not only that, but he had already led military conquest on behalf of Egypt's power and might.

156
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:11,640
 And he had done all of this in absolute opulent prosperity, living in one of the wealthiest

157
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,360
 families of that time.

158
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:24,080
 And Moses, now 40 years old, is struggling with exactly who he is.

159
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,880
 He's basically going to have a midlife crisis in the passage we look at today.

160
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,760
 And he's like, "Hang on, who am I?

161
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
 Am I a Hebrew?

162
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,240
 Well, by blood, yes.

163
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
 Am I Egyptian?

164
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:42,480
 Well, by my literal and metaphorical clothes, my identity, yes I am.

165
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:51,480
 So does that mean then that I'm one of the oppressed or am I actually the oppressor?"

166
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,080
 Moses is wondering, "Am I really a liberator of my people or actually am I a part of the

167
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,640
 very problem?"

168
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,340
 And this internal conflict that's happening for Moses quickly enables Moses to realize,

169
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,080
 and for us as we look at this passage to realize, that in the Exodus story, there isn't this

170
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,880
 clear cut idea of the good and the bad.

171
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,440
 But as so often in all of our lives, there's a lot of nuance and gray and the coming together

172
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,880
 of a lot of different things.

173
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,360
 And just like me, who had been born in one culture and raised in the other and was desperately

174
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,720
 trying to work out who I am, Moses, born in one culture, raised in another, and now at

175
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,320
 40 years old going, "What do I do next?"

176
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,480
 And it's all of that tension that we now turn our attention to as I take you back to the

177
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
 land of Egypt.

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
 Let's have a look.

179
00:10:47,480 --> 00:11:05,480
 [Music]

180
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,000
 So the kind of TV shows or movies that I've always been drawn to are the ones where there

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,480
 are no cliché good guys versus bad guys, but where every character has the propensity

182
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,800
 for moments of both great goodness and great evil.

183
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,360
 And I think one of the reasons why I'm drawn to this kind of storytelling is because it

184
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,520
 reveals to us something about our shared common humanity, that each one of us has the potentiality

185
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,320
 to be both oppressed and the oppressor, to be winners as well as losers.

186
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,600
 Every single one of us has had moments that we have been deeply proud of, but we've also

187
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,240
 had moments that we've regretted and have deeply buried.

188
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,440
 You know, if we deny this, we actually enter into one of the slaveries that I think so

189
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,840
 many of us become blind to, and that's the slavery of denial.

190
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,320
 As the Exodus narrative continues, we quickly discover that there are no straight cut good

191
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,520
 guys and bad guys.

192
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,160
 At the halfway mark of the second chapter, we discover Moses as a grown man, and not

193
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,240
 just any man, but a prince of Egypt, having been raised in Pharaoh's very household.

194
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,960
 I mean, consider the privilege and prestige that had been afforded Moses.

195
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,720
 Despite his Hebrew origin, he was raised by one of the wealthiest Egyptians in the land,

196
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,480
 and was surrounded day and night by its customs and culture.

197
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,720
 He had been cared for, raised, and educated by Pharaoh and his family, all while his own

198
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,840
 people suffered at the hand of their oppression.

199
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,120
 At this point in the story, Moses is not the Jewish people's hero, but actually a part

200
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
 of the problem.

201
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,640
 Perhaps even worse, for Moses was a Jew adopted into the family of the oppressors, and he

202
00:12:43,640 --> 00:13:04,640
 had not done anything at all to stop that oppression.

203
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,200
 But suddenly, everything changes.

204
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,600
 One day, you see, Moses is out, and he's just observing the hard labor that his people are

205
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
 under, and he sees an Egyptian beating up a Hebrew.

206
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,680
 Now, that was probably an everyday occurrence in that time, but for whatever reason, on

207
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,800
 this particular day, Moses decides to act.

208
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,600
 He attacks the Egyptian, and it ends up actually killing him.

209
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,880
 And in his panic, he decides to bury the Egyptian in the sand, hoping that in burying that Egyptian,

210
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,960
 he'd be able to distance himself from the violence that he's created, hoping to cover

211
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,800
 up his crime, if you will.

212
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,120
 Now, before we judge Moses a little bit too harshly, I think we have to realize that all

213
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,320
 of us have the tendency to do this.

214
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
 We may not be out there murdering people, but we hurt people.

215
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,700
 We say things.

216
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,040
 We actually pull people down, and when we do so, we so often try to bury that hurt,

217
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,960
 try to bury that shame, try to distance ourselves from it, and in so doing, actually, try to

218
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,360
 provide for us a cover for the thing that we've done.

219
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,120
 Maybe, perhaps, just like Moses, rather than burying these things, we need to actually

220
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,360
 expose them in order for them to be redeemed.

221
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:32,080
 (Music)

222
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,560
 In many ways, Moses had been burying things for years.

223
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,440
 He had buried his Hebrew ancestry in the sand of Egyptian culture and customs, hiding his

224
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,120
 true identity in the power of Pharaoh's royalty and prestige, remaining blind to the oppression

225
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,540
 around him.

226
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,760
 This is what we do when we're trapped in the slavery of denial.

227
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,240
 We run from the realities of our own contribution to the oppression of others by burying ourselves

228
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,960
 in self-righteousness that placates our guilt and shame and keeps us aloof, uncaring, unfeeling,

229
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,920
 and disconnected.

230
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,520
 Moses murders an Egyptian and buries him in the hope that he can remain disconnected from

231
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,520
 his crime and get away from his violence.

232
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,740
 But he's about to discover something we always seem to forget when trapped in the slavery

233
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,960
 of denial.

234
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:31,960
 Our mistakes rarely stay buried forever.

235
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,640
 Edward gets back to Pharaoh about what Moses has done, and not surprisingly, Pharaoh is

236
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
 furious.

237
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,560
 I mean, the very one that he had raised almost like his own son, the one who had been adopted

238
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,520
 by his daughter, the one who he had high hopes for in his own court, has actually killed

239
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,440
 an Egyptian subject.

240
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,760
 And how does Pharaoh respond?

241
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,520
 Well, he decides he needs to kill Moses, that there needs to be blood for blood.

242
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,020
 Well Moses hears about the scheme of Pharaoh against him, and so he flees to the far side

243
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:07,000
 of Midian and comes to a well that's not so dissimilar to this one right here.

244
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,800
 Now, these wells were a lifeline in the harsh desert conditions like these around me right

245
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,920
 now, and no doubt Moses would have camped near this kind of well for a couple of days,

246
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,080
 perhaps reflecting back on the week that had just been.

247
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:27,320
 How one random act of violence had turned his whole life upside down, and how now his

248
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,840
 own family was trying to kill him.

249
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,960
 And this is an aspect of the Exodus story that I think it's easy for us all to miss.

250
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,680
 When we think of the Exodus story, we think of Pharaoh and Moses like bitter enemies against

251
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,160
 each other, as if they're like a protagonist and an antagonist, a good guy and a bad guy.

252
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,800
 But actually the story is far more nuanced than that.

253
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,720
 Actually the start of the Exodus narrative is a story about a betrayal within a family,

254
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,200
 about a son who feels betrayed by his adopted father, how a father feels betrayed by his

255
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,080
 adopted son.

256
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,360
 And all of that combines together to create such fury and animosity and oppression that

257
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,880
 the whole of the Exodus journey begins from that point.

258
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,560
 And I think all of this teaches us something that's quite critical about our own journeys

259
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,600
 from slavery to freedom, and it's this.

260
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,160
 That so often the most painful moments of oppression occur not by those who are strangers

261
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:40,560
 to us, but by those that we love the most.

262
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,600
 The wound causes Moses to bury once again.

263
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,120
 He's lost his Egyptian family and he's run from his own people who are in need.

264
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,200
 He has a deep sense of shame attached to both.

265
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,440
 And like we all so often do when faced with our failures and our brokenness, he flees

266
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,160
 into lies and self-denial, recreating a new identity with a new group of people, and in

267
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,040
 so doing hoping he can permanently bury his past.

268
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,480
 But that's not the way it works with God.

269
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,160
 God is in the business of revealing that which is hidden in darkness.

270
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:27,240
 And for Moses, a new light is about to shine.

271
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,280
 God is in the business of revealing the things that are hidden in darkness.

272
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,960
 What we're about to look at as we open up this story in a bit more detail together is

273
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,160
 I think the most significant thing that you need to open your heart to.

274
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,840
 If you duly want to go in an Exodus journey yourself, I can't stress how important what

275
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:53,760
 happens next for Moses is for us as we think about our own liberation from the things that

276
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,560
 we also want to hide.

277
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,200
 Let me read this to you from chapter 2, verse 11.

278
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,160
 Everybody okay still?

279
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
 How beautiful by the way.

280
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,000
 That was Jordan, not Egypt by the way.

281
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,680
 Isn't that cool?

282
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
 Yeah.

283
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,560
 Every week everybody's coming up to me and they're like, "I want to go to Egypt now."

284
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,560
 And I'm like, "Yeah, that's great."

285
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,680
 But that was Jordan, just want to say.

286
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,080
 One day after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched

287
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,720
 them at their hard labor.

288
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,200
 He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.

289
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,560
 Glancing this way and that, he killed him and then took the Egyptian and hid him in

290
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,000
 the sand.

291
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,200
 The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting.

292
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
 Let's just stop there.

293
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
 Let me read 12 again.

294
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,920
 "Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in

295
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,320
 the sand."

296
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,920
 This is a turning point in Moses' life, a complete and utter radical turning point.

297
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,960
 He's about the age 40 here.

298
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,400
 And like I said before, Moses doesn't give us any details about the life prior to this

299
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
 point.

300
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,120
 Almost as if he wants to just kind of rush over that and get to this point.

301
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,240
 He's 40 years old, dressed in the robes of his Egyptian culture and identity.

302
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,360
 And yet today he goes out and probably does what he had done on a very regular basis,

303
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,640
 take a look at what was happening amongst his own flesh and blood, amongst the Hebrew

304
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
 people.

305
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,960
 And he sees a scene that would have been part of the everyday life of that time, an Egyptian

306
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,080
 slave master being tough on a Hebrew slave.

307
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,560
 And again, Moses would have seen that many, many times.

308
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,680
 But this day, something different takes place.

309
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,880
 Question is, why?

310
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,360
 Well, Moses helps us to understand that by a word he uses here.

311
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,040
 It says in the English, "He watched them at their labor."

312
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,920
 This word "watch" that Moses writes here is the word "ra'ah."

313
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,760
 And ra'ah is a very important Hebrew word that actually is now repeated from this point

314
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,400
 forward about five times in the next three chapters.

315
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,880
 The word ra'ah means this.

316
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,760
 It means to see with emotion, to see something and be moved by it.

317
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,180
 Not just to observe something, but now to be moved by it.

318
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,920
 This is the difference you see between Moses having seen the oppression of his people for

319
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:15,520
 40 years and never done anything about it, to this moment now wanting, stirred to, something

320
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,120
 in his spirit that moves him to want to act.

321
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,080
 This is the exact same word that we saw last week that was applied to Pharaoh's daughter

322
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,640
 when she sees Moses in the waters and she is moved with compassion to save him.

323
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,080
 She ra'ahs, she sees him with emotion, draws him up and brings him into her family.

324
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,880
 The same word is being used here.

325
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,240
 And just like we said last week, the word holds with it the idea that God's spirit is

326
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,400
 involved in the emotive, the compassion, the desire to do something, the heart change.

327
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,000
 God's spirit is at work in it.

328
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,560
 So what we're seeing here in the start of our story today is that Moses' heart is being

329
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
 changed.

330
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,920
 There's a significant shift that's happening for him as he now sees with emotion and compassion

331
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,840
 and he's beginning to understand, "Hang on, these are my people.

332
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,320
 Hang on, there's something going on here.

333
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,880
 These are not just the oppressed around us.

334
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,840
 These are actually my people and my heart is being stirred to kind of do something."

335
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,840
 But this is a difficult journey for him because he's still caught between these two identities.

336
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,400
 He's still struggling with, "Am I this or am I that?"

337
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,400
 The writer in the book of Hebrews, very interestingly, actually pulls out this exact moment and he

338
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,320
 says something that's, I think, quite helpful for us to see.

339
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,800
 This is Hebrews chapter 11, starting in verse 24.

340
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,520
 It says, "By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's

341
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
 daughter.

342
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,280
 He chose instead to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the

343
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,760
 pleasures of sin for a short time."

344
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,240
 Now I think the writer of Hebrews here is writing about what took place for Moses after

345
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
 this moment.

346
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,120
 Most scholars would argue, "Is it before this moment?

347
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,320
 Is it after this moment?"

348
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,400
 I think it's after.

349
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,520
 I think God is the starting point of stirring something in Moses' heart as he sees his people

350
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,520
 on this particular day and he will go on to align himself more and more with his Israelite

351
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,280
 identity and move away from his Egyptian one.

352
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,800
 But in this moment, he sees something, it stirs his heart, and he wants to respond.

353
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:31,800
 But this tension is real and this tension is also real for us.

354
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:38,360
 Moses is struggling with his identity and realizing that the identity that he's embraced

355
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,600
 is not now the identity that God is beginning to speak to him about.

356
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,360
 Are you following that?

357
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,760
 And that's going to be every person in here's journey if you truly want to go on Exodus.

358
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,720
 You're going to have to realize that the identity that you have embraced is not necessarily

359
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,840
 the one that God wants you to walk in.

360
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,880
 Each one of us wear the clothes of identities that we have embraced throughout our lives

361
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,640
 that do not represent the full truth of who we are.

362
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,000
 Come on church.

363
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,800
 That's the first thing you need to grapple with here.

364
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,000
 That you have identities that have been formed in you, shaped in you by preferences and choices,

365
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,440
 that have been formed and shaped in you by family dynamics, that have been formed and

366
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,200
 shaped in you by your marriages and by the people around you in your workplaces, that

367
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,960
 have been formed and shaped in you by your thinking and your attitude, formed and shaped

368
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,960
 in you by your sin and your brokenness.

369
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,480
 And those identities are often the things that we wear to try to find a place in this

370
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:49,400
 world and you will never, never journey in Exodus until you have the courage to step

371
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,680
 away from some of those identities.

372
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:57,360
 The starting point of all of our journeys in Exodus is to remove the clothes that we

373
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:06,320
 are wearing that cover up the person that we truly want to be in Christ Jesus.

374
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,360
 We have to have the courage to remove those identities, to recognize that those identities

375
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,880
 are ours, to be honest about them and sober about them and say that this identity has

376
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,040
 come and been placed upon me and I'm in this middle ground.

377
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,800
 I'm a third culture person right now and I know what Christ wants.

378
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,520
 Christ is stirring something in my heart.

379
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,420
 There's a call to liberation.

380
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,480
 There's a call to freedom from my sin and my brokenness and yet I recognize that I'm

381
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,560
 still dressed in the clothes of the oppressing identity.

382
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,760
 Something has to change.

383
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,280
 Some of us in this room, here's the honest reality.

384
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,160
 We have gotten comfortable in the clothes of Egypt.

385
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:58,240
 I'm going to say that again because I just felt strongly the Spirit of God for you.

386
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,900
 The honest truth is I'm like this as well.

387
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,840
 We have become comfortable in the clothes of Egypt.

388
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,440
 If we're going to really be honest and truthful and sober about this series that we're in,

389
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,800
 it's only going to happen if we're willing to recognize that we've become comfortable

390
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,440
 in identities that have come to shape and form us and make us think that we're someone

391
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,520
 when the reality is we're only someone in Christ Jesus.

392
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,680
 That invitation is a bold one from God and it's not an easy one to wrestle with and Moses

393
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,380
 is wrestling with it and here's how he tries to respond with it.

394
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,640
 He sees an Egyptian slave master beating on one of his own people and in kind of going,

395
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,840
 "Well, I think I am Hebrew.

396
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,000
 I am Hebrew and I want my Hebrew people to identify with me and I want them to accept

397
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,080
 me," he steps in and does what only he knows because of how he's been raised to kind of

398
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,720
 sort of sort out a problem that's happening between two people.

399
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,120
 He goes in and he kills the Egyptian.

400
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,800
 I want you to see this church because it's super important.

401
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,840
 Moses being stirred by God in his heart to stand on behalf of the oppression of his people,

402
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,880
 his first act to be a liberator of his people is violence and murder.

403
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,600
 In other words, Moses, even though his heart is beginning to be stirred, his clothes are

404
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,800
 still very Egyptian and so he has a heart to move.

405
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:31,120
 He has the right idea, the wrong method and the Egyptian clothes that he wears metaphorically

406
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,600
 and as well as literally are shaping him still and he thinks, "Oh, well, this is the way

407
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,720
 I liberate my people.

408
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,120
 I need to go in with that mighty kind of military strategy.

409
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,560
 Look what I did in Ethiopia.

410
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,600
 I can do that now on behalf of my people."

411
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,760
 He's basically acting like Pharaoh in order to be a liberator of his people.

412
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,440
 Are you following this?

413
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:58,120
 And when we act in the brokenness that we embrace, in the wrong identities that we have

414
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:04,280
 to try to do God's will, there's always going to be a problem with that.

415
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,720
 Need to understand that you cannot bring about God's exodus through your own brokenness.

416
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
 Hello?

417
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,520
 You guys okay?

418
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,360
 You cannot bring about God's exodus through your own brokenness.

419
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
 Here's the reality.

420
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,720
 It is not your exodus.

421
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,200
 So many of us, as we start this series, we're wanting exodus from the things that are holding

422
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,320
 us, from the things that are enslaving us and we have an idea of what that exodus will

423
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
 look like.

424
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,520
 We have to let go of our agenda of exodus to actually receive God's exodus that he has

425
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
 for us.

426
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,520
 Your brokenness is never going to be the vehicle by which you're going to be able to act in

427
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
 exodus.

428
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,560
 And here's Moses' brokenness as one of Pharaoh who's thinking that it's all about power,

429
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,920
 it's all about prestige, it's all about might.

430
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,200
 That psalm that says, "Some trust in horses, some trust in chariots, but I trust in the

431
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
 name of the Lord."

432
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,960
 Moses has the mentality, "We trust in horses.

433
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
 We trust in chariots.

434
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,000
 It's our wisdom.

435
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 It's our strength."

436
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 And I think Moses took it even further.

437
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,160
 I think Moses was thinking, "This is maybe why God has raised me in Pharaoh's household,

438
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,920
 so that I would be well-educated, so I would be strong, so I would know all the strategies,

439
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,320
 so I can now go and stand in the gap and just in the way that we killed all of those Ethiopians,

440
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,680
 I can now kill this Egyptian in the hopes of setting my people free."

441
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:31,600
 And you get the sense that God is standing back from all that and going, "Hmm."

442
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,480
 Moses buries his sin.

443
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,560
 He kills somebody, had no authority to do so.

444
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,040
 And he knew it was wrong, that's why he buries the Egyptian.

445
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,880
 And he buries him in sand because he wants to get away with the sin.

446
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,360
 You can almost see the shame that's inside of him.

447
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,320
 It says in the scripture that he looked left and he looked right.

448
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,680
 The thing he failed to do was to look up.

449
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,880
 And he takes this Egyptian and he buries him in the sand, hoping he's going to get away

450
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,680
 with it, thinking he's gotten away with it.

451
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,480
 In fact, so much so that he goes back the next day to see how his people is doing, thinking

452
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,560
 that he's completely got away with everything.

453
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,960
 And we have to be really honest with ourselves and realize we do this too.

454
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,600
 Just like I said in the film, we have a habit of burying our sin.

455
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,420
 We have a habit of covering up the things that we do that we know is not what God wants

456
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,280
 for us, what we know is not right.

457
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,140
 And we cover these things up and we kind of pretend like they haven't happened.

458
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,720
 You want to know what I think is the true global pandemic in the church today?

459
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
 It's secret sin.

460
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,640
 In fact, when I was preparing this series four years ago, I felt the Holy Spirit say

461
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,760
 to me very strongly, "Andrew, there's a lot of secret sin in the vine.

462
00:30:50,760 --> 00:31:02,360
 There's a lot of sin that we're doing knowingly and we're covering up with the sand to avoid

463
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,240
 and we think we're getting away with it."

464
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,040
 Yeah, I was on that website, but I cleared the history.

465
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
 My wife won't see it.

466
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,360
 Yeah, I did that dodgy business deal, but I trust the person.

467
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
 He's not going to tell anyone.

468
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,600
 It's going to be fine.

469
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,820
 When the church walks in the secrecy of sin, the enemy has won because the enemy's nature

470
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,400
 is to be secretive.

471
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,160
 The Lord's nature is to be open and vulnerable and transparent and real.

472
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,560
 And the more that we operate in the secretness of our sin, the more the enemy has won and

473
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,180
 the power of the church is reduced.

474
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:47,480
 And God's standing over us and He's going, "You can bury all you want, but I know.

475
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
 I see it.

476
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
 I love you.

477
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,120
 I'm not here to condemn you.

478
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,480
 I'm not here to make you feel terrible.

479
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,920
 I'm here to set you free.

480
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,400
 But in order for you to be set free, you've got to stop burying stuff.

481
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,920
 You've got to stop doing that.

482
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:09,760
 You've got to start working out that actually your honesty, your transparency, your willingness

483
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,660
 to not be like Adam and Eve who were once naked and unashamed, who through their sin

484
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,000
 became naked and ashamed, covered themselves up.

485
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,120
 And God shows up and says, "Who told you you were naked?"

486
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,000
 In other words, I'm welcoming you back into a relationship with me where there doesn't

487
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,560
 need to be secrecy, there doesn't need to be hiddenness, there doesn't need to be brokenness.

488
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,520
 I want to set you free.

489
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:42,320
 And Moses, like us, has killed, has felt shame, has buried.

490
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,280
 And any time you bury sin, any time you bury shame, any time you bury guilt, it is just

491
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,680
 festering and festering and festering, and it has the power to come up and ruin you unless

492
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,660
 the Spirit of God comes and enables you through His beautiful kindness and conviction that

493
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:04,080
 leads to repentance where you can say, "Lord, I am ashamed of this, but in your eyes, you

494
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
 love me.

495
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
 Here it is.

496
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080
 Set me free."

497
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,920
 That's the heart of Exodus.

498
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,800
 Are you with me still so far?

499
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,360
 Now I want you to see what happens next, verse 13 onwards.

500
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,360
 I'm enjoying this.

501
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,920
 Are you guys okay?

502
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,120
 Verse 13 says this, "The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting."

503
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,080
 So the next day, thinking he's gotten away with everything, goes back out to be the savior

504
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,160
 of his people, right?

505
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,040
 He asked one that was wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"

506
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,040
 The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us?

507
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,880
 Are you thinking of killing me just as you killed the Egyptian?"

508
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
 Ouch!

509
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,800
 It's like a mic drop moment.

510
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,640
 We know what you did.

511
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
 Everybody knows what you did.

512
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,480
 We're all talking about it.

513
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
 We all know.

514
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
 You can't hide this thing.

515
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,600
 You killed an Egyptian, and that's really bad news for all of us.

516
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,680
 So are you going to kill us now like you killed the Egyptian?

517
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:04,280
 Are you going to try to cover up all of your mistakes all the time?

518
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:10,640
 Then Moses was afraid, understandably, and thought, "What I did must have become known."

519
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
 I love it.

520
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
 It's really interesting what they say here.

521
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,800
 They say to Moses, "Who made you ruler and judge over us?"

522
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,600
 In other words, we didn't ask for a deliverer.

523
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,480
 We didn't ask for you to be our deliverer.

524
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,520
 "Who made you ruler and judge over us?

525
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,720
 Because you're still dressed in your Egyptian identity.

526
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,640
 You're still dressed in your Egyptian clothes.

527
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:34,600
 You're still thinking like a pharaoh, and we see you, Moses, as one of the oppressors,

528
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
 not one of the oppressed.

529
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,720
 Oh, you might have our blood, but that's all you have.

530
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,040
 Who made you?

531
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,120
 Who decided that you could be our ruler and judge?"

532
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,120
 What they were basically saying to him is this, "Don't you realize that we don't want

533
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,400
 you?

534
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,760
 We don't want your pharaoh power in our lives.

535
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,560
 In fact, Moses, you're a part of the problem.

536
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,760
 You killing the Egyptian yesterday has made our lives worse."

537
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,680
 He's seen this.

538
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,160
 Now there's also something else going on here.

539
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,760
 God is also speaking to Moses.

540
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,800
 Because when these two Hebrews say to him, "Who made you ruler and judge over us?"

541
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,840
 God is speaking to Moses, and God is saying, "Who made you ruler and judge over my people?

542
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
 Have I done that yet?

543
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,520
 No, no, no, I haven't done that yet.

544
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,440
 Oh, I'm stirring your heart by my spirit.

545
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,560
 I'm rehiring you.

546
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,400
 You're beginning to see the injustice of my people.

547
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,000
 I'm beginning to work, but there's so much, Moses, that has to happen in your life, so

548
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,840
 much that needs to change in your life before I am going to use you to be my deliverer.

549
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,960
 Because if I used you now, your methods and your thinking is going to be the world's wisdom,

550
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,040
 the world's strength, your mighty army strength.

551
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,320
 I have so much I need to unravel, so much I need to get out of you, so much I need to

552
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
 change in you.

553
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
 I have not released you.

554
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,320
 You're in fact going to live for 40 years in Midian in this horrible desert before I

555
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,520
 even show up as a burning bush and begin to officially call you to be a liberator.

556
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,840
 You are not that person right now, and you need to realize there's work that needs to

557
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
 be done."

558
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,320
 Do you see it?

559
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,600
 And God is being pretty strong with Moses here.

560
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,360
 "I haven't told you yet, and yet you're jumping the gun.

561
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:18,600
 You're getting straight into this stuff, and that's not the way it works here."

562
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:26,680
 And Moses realizes that there is so much he needs to deal with.

563
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:35,160
 You see, for Moses, he is going to quickly realize that in order for him to be his people's

564
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,440
 deliverer, he's first of all going to need deliverance himself.

565
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,040
 Come on, church.

566
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,120
 In order for him to eventually become his people's deliverer, he's first of all going

567
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,760
 to have to experience deliverance himself.

568
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,220
 And I want to be bold and stand before you all today and say this.

569
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,960
 If you are enjoying this series, if you're feeling like the Lord is calling you into

570
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,240
 Exodus, here's the bold, sobering reality.

571
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,280
 You will need some deliverance.

572
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,600
 You are going to need, like Moses, to get rid of some of your faulty identities.

573
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:14,400
 You're going to need to be willing to allow God to come and stir some things in you.

574
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,240
 The journey of Exodus is not all cupcakes and My Little Ponies.

575
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,440
 The journey of Exodus is gritty and real.

576
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,220
 And if it's going to have any lasting change, it starts with the reality that we are dressed

577
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,680
 in the wrong clothes some of the time.

578
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,600
 And God, would you come and, hmm, would you come and help me?

579
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,600
 Notice what happens next, because this is tough.

580
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,560
 Verse 15, "When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses.

581
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,920
 But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian."

582
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
 Fascinating.

583
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,320
 Remember what I said in the film, and this is so true.

584
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,720
 This is not just a good guy and a bad guy who are suddenly fighting against each other

585
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,960
 now.

586
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,980
 This is an adopted father who is now heartbroken because of what his adopted son has done.

587
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,280
 This is an adopted son who's wrestling with the oppression of his adopted father, who's

588
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,500
 trying to work that through in his head.

589
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,940
 This is Pharaoh who probably always harbored insecurities that maybe one day Moses might

590
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,440
 turn against him.

591
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,440
 That maybe one day because of his Hebrew blood, maybe one day he might.

592
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:29,160
 And so perhaps Moses, oh sorry, perhaps Pharaoh in hoping to get all of that out of Moses,

593
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,400
 puts him in the school, gets them all pharaohed up, tells him he's going to groom him to be

594
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,480
 the next leader, sends him on a conquest to Ethiopia, because all of that is designed

595
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,040
 by Pharaoh to get the Hebrew out of Moses.

596
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:49,380
 And now we're at a point where Pharaoh realizes that all that hard work has achieved nothing,

597
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,040
 because when it came to it, Moses has now chosen his people.

598
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,920
 And so Pharaoh's response is blood for blood.

599
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,840
 You kill one of my subjects, I'm going to kill you.

600
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,120
 And couldn't you imagine the depth of pain now for Moses?

601
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,960
 I want you to see this, really important, because not only has Moses been rejected by

602
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,080
 his own people, the Hebrews, who have said, "We don't want you as judge over us."

603
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:21,800
 He's now been rejected by his own family, his own people that loved him and raised him

604
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,720
 for 40 years.

605
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,960
 They now want to kill him.

606
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,880
 And Moses is now in a place where he's like, "Hang on a sec, literally a minute ago I was

607
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,560
 somebody and now I'm nobody."

608
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,760
 And God goes, "Now we can get to work."

609
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,080
 Come on church, now we can get to work.

610
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:48,320
 There's a journey that you have to go on, from being a somebody in the world's eyes

611
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,520
 to being a nobody in the world's eyes, so that God can then turn you into a somebody

612
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
 in his eyes.

613
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,760
 So that he can now come and begin to form and shape in you the person that he truly

614
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,360
 is calling you to be.

615
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,640
 This is Moses' great moment of disruption and disorientation.

616
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,200
 And if you're anything like me, seasons of disorientation are disorientating.

617
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
 They're not easy.

618
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,640
 They're hard.

619
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,320
 They're painful.

620
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,280
 But you need to understand something very central to the Exodus journey.

621
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:25,380
 There is no process of liberation until there is first a process of disorientation.

622
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,800
 There is no ability for you to be set free until you first wrestle deeply with the reality

623
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,960
 of your brokenness.

624
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,600
 There is no liberation that can happen until you first face disorientation, disruption,

625
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,040
 the recognition of a brokenness, and to say, "This is not what I want."

626
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,920
 And Moses, as painful as it is, is now stripped from all of his identities.

627
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,320
 And he flees to Midian, and he sits down at a well, and he begins to form a new identity.

628
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,320
 And we don't have time to look at the story today, but he meets a woman, and he does this

629
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,440
 amazing thing, and he saves this family, and they suddenly bring him into their family,

630
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,080
 and he has kids, and he builds a whole new life as a shepherd.

631
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,640
 His father-in-law is a shepherd.

632
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,360
 He becomes a shepherd.

633
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,520
 All of that for 40 years before God even shows up in the burning bush and does anything.

634
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,000
 And it's like God is saying this, "What the world meant for evil, I'm going to use for

635
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 good.

636
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,360
 You just got rejected by your people and rejected by me, sorry, by Pharaoh's family.

637
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,920
 I'm going to step in now, and what was meant for evil, I'm going to now turn for good."

638
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,880
 None of this was a surprise to God, and God steps into the circumstances of brokenness,

639
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,240
 and he meets Moses and says, "Now we can begin."

640
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:49,880
 And here's the question, are you willing to embrace the disorientation of the broken identities

641
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,080
 that sit over your life?

642
00:41:51,080 --> 00:42:01,160
 Are you willing to soberly see them with emotion, to recognize them, and where you have up until

643
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,720
 now just buried them, be willing to come to the Lord with an open hand and say, "God,

644
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,400
 this is what's going on, and I cannot, will not, don't want to.

645
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,820
 And Lord, it is breaking me.

646
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,920
 It is warring in me.

647
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,240
 I am disorientated.

648
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,240
 I am disrupted, and God, I am desperately in need.

649
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,000
 And in order for me to move into your spirit and with what you want, I need to now purge.

650
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,160
 Help me, Lord, do that."

651
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,560
 The season of disorientation starts by asking three very important questions.

652
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,920
 I want to share these questions, and then I'm going to pray with you.

653
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,240
 Here's the first question.

654
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,240
 What clothes are you wearing today that God needs to strip away from you?

655
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,160
 All of us are carrying identities that I've talked about earlier that God wants to deal

656
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,160
 with.

657
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,720
 What are the ones that you're carrying with you?

658
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:59,440
 Number two, what sins have you committed that you have long since buried that God in his

659
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,920
 love and grace wants to expose so he can heal you?

660
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,800
 What is the sand that you've been placing over the box that you've put stuff in, hidden

661
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,640
 away from everybody so they can't see it, and you're covering it all up?

662
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,840
 What are the sins that you're getting away with or think you're getting away with right

663
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,240
 now that God actually wants to begin to speak to you about and put his finger on out of

664
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,680
 his grace and mercy so that he can truly set you free?

665
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,180
 Here's the third and final one.

666
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:32,640
 What desert might God need to bring you to in order to remove from you the earthly power

667
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,320
 and privilege that only gets in the way of God's power being made manifest in your life?

668
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,640
 That's the place of disorientation.

669
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,680
 Where does God need to bring you to so that he can shake away the comforts of this world

670
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,880
 so that you can finally find comfort in him?

671
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,960
 That is how we start Exodus.

672
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,180
 And Moses, as painful as it was for him to sit down in that well and wonder, "How did

673
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,060
 my life just get turned upside down?"

674
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,940
 It is now that God can meet him and begin to form in him the leader he would become

675
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,840
 so that he wouldn't stand before Pharaoh with Pharaoh's authority and power, but instead

676
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:19,800
 with a simple shepherd's staff and say plainly before him, "Let my people go."

677
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,680
 As I stand before you today as your pastor, that's what I feel for you.

678
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:32,160
 I stand before you and I say to the enemy who is trying to hold you back, "Let my people

679
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
 go."

680
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,680
 I wonder whether you would pray with me.

681
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,920
 Let's pray.

682
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,040
 Father, we come before you here.

683
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:58,200
 Father, just settling ourselves into the uncomfortableness of disorientation, being willing to be disrupted

684
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
 by you.

685
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:07,800
 Father, I want to pray for us as a community of faith.

686
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:14,800
 Father, for each person here, it's their own journey.

687
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,320
 But Lord, I want to pray for the kindness of your presence to convict, particularly

688
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:30,760
 for us who have secret sin that we haven't shared with anyone, maybe out of shame, guilt,

689
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:36,500
 whatever it might be, that we are hiding from our loved ones, and most importantly, hiding

690
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,400
 from you.

691
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,000
 We know we can't hide anything from you.

692
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,200
 You see all things, but we bury nonetheless.

693
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:55,480
 Father, I pray for each person here who can resonate with the reality of buried sin.

694
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,920
 I pray in your gentleness and kindness you'd meet them now.

695
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:06,660
 I pray for courage for each person in this room to do the right thing.

696
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:13,700
 Father, I pray for those of us in this room who are trying to bring about Exodus on our

697
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:20,680
 own terms, just like Moses wearing the wrong identity, thinking that liberation could come

698
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,620
 by might and power.

699
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:28,660
 Forgive us, Lord, where we think our own Exodus comes through might and power of our own strength.

700
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,260
 Let's try harder, power of positive thinking, whatever it might be.

701
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:39,420
 Father, would we submit ourselves to your Exodus and your Exodus alone?

702
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:47,140
 And even if that means an uncomfortable season of disorientation, Father, would you give

703
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:53,260
 us the courage to walk into it?

704
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:59,460
 And Father, anyone here who knows that there's an identity that they're holding, maybe something

705
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:07,620
 that they've made an idol of, maybe it's the work you do, maybe it's the status you have,

706
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:13,460
 maybe it's the followers you've got, maybe it's whatever it is, but there's something

707
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:17,300
 that is, there's an identity that works in you and works, and you know it's your weak

708
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,300
 place.

709
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,500
 You know it's the place that you use to cover up insecurity.

710
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,580
 It's the place that you use to cover up your brokenness.

711
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:29,620
 It's the outward facing, I've got it all together person.

712
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:37,580
 And I wonder whether over this series you would have the courage to allow God to change

713
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:45,780
 that identity, to trust him that he knows you better than you know yourself, and that

714
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,460
 you'd be identified as his child, as the greatest identity you could ever hold.

715
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,020
 And it doesn't mean that you can't be a great banker or a great lawyer, or you can't have

716
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:57,020
 a great marriage, or you can't be influential.

717
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,580
 All those things can be there, but they come through our identity in Christ.

718
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,580
 Those things are not our identity.

719
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,860
 And I say that over some of you in the name of Jesus, because you need to hear it, and

720
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,860
 God wants to deal with it in your life.

721
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,860
 So whatever it might mean for you, just take a moment now to let the Holy Spirit speak

722
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,100
 to you.

723
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,680
 (upbeat music)
