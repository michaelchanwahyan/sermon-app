1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
 It begins in the emptiness of nothingness, where darkness has extinguished even the memory

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,240
 of light, where nothingness and emptiness tear space into fragments and everything is

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,800
 nothing at all.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,600
 It starts here, where fear shackles and failure persists, where slavery binds and oppression

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:35,560
 persists, it starts here, in the place you least expect, suddenly, a light.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,480
 Dancing to be noticed, within the empire of darkness, crackling with beginnings, restless

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,940
 with life, as if the emptiness had simply been waiting for divine direction.

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,400
 It starts here.

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,480
 Shadows now play against the walls of death, movement and memory and miracles and might,

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,480
 breaking into nothingness with the heresy of possibility, shaming the darkness with

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,600
 the creation of hope.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
 It starts here.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:12,480
 A drawing out, a calling forth, a voice in the wilderness, a wilderness of voices, whispers

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,840
 of freedom, bushes on fire, a journey beyond, ascending to glory.

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,880
 It starts here, in the emptiness of nothingness, in the slavery and oppression, in the fear

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,680
 and the failure and the pharaohs in us all.

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,400
 May you see what heaven is stirring.

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,480
 For a light has come and a light is coming, death now dead, bushes now burning, yes a

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,400
 light has come and a light is coming, death now dead, bushes now burning.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:52,400
 [Music]

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,900
