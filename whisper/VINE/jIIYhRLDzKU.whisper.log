[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200]   Thanks, Justin.
[00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.960]   You know, as a friend and a brother,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.680]   you don't come much better than Justin.
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.480]   So I love you, bro.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.760]   Appreciate it.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.200]   OK.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.400]   November 22, 1989.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.160]   Where were you on this day?
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.920]   Maybe some of you weren't even born yet.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.720]   That's OK.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.120]   November 22, 1989, though, is one of the most important dates
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.720]   in the world because it was the date
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.600]   of the most important scientific breakthrough this world has
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.280]   ever seen.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.160]   In a small town of Hill Valley, California,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.200]   Dr. Emmett Brown and his trusty sidekick, Marty McFly,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.840]   got into the DeLorean equipped with a flux capacitor
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.240]   with 1.21 gigawatts of power, traveling at 88 miles per hour,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:56.120]   zoomed into the future date of October 21, 2015.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.560]   Now, I'm totally dating myself, and there's a bunch of you
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.320]   here who know what I'm talking about.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.480]   I'm, of course, referring to Back to the Future Part 2,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.640]   one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.240]   You can call me lowbrow if you want.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.480]   I don't care.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.040]   But it is.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.240]   It's a great movie.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.360]   Back to the Future 2 gives us a glimpse
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.040]   of what director Robert Zemeckis thought
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.600]   the future might look like.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.960]   And it's a pretty funny picture, mainly because here we
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.760]   are sitting in 2023.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.320]   If you haven't seen the movie, go and watch it tonight.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.240]   Do a Bible study, pray, and all that stuff.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.200]   OK, that's good.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.960]   But then watch Back to the Future 2 tonight.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.120]   You will not regret it.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.320]   It's an amazing film.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.840]   But this was Zemeckis in the '80s,
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.280]   projecting to what he thought 2015 would look like.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.720]   Flying cars, self-lacing shoes--
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.600]   I still want those shoes--
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.640]   self-drying clothes, pizza that cooks in just an instant.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.600]   Remember that scene where the older version of him
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.640]   puts it into the oven, and bing, and instantly it
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.400]   turns into a big pizza?
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.320]   Hoverboards, ridiculous fashion--
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.680]   we have none of these things in 2023
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.680]   apart from the ridiculous fashion part, right?
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.040]   But we started this year.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.200]   We started 2023 in a sermon series called Will You See?
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.920]   And over the past month or so, we've
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.280]   been discovering how God is preparing us for the new things
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.160]   through looking at the book of Isaiah.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.080]   And so we started on New Year's Day
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.240]   where we said we can't put God in a box.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.160]   But instead, we need to expand of how we think God can move.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.680]   Around Chinese New Year, we stepped
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.280]   into the churchwide fast.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.120]   And we talked about how our God is a God of justice.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.600]   And therefore, we, too, need to be a people of justice.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.160]   And one of the best ways we can prepare ourselves
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.920]   to do this work is through our fasting and praying.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.400]   That's how we renew our passion for justice.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.480]   In week three, we had a very frank and honest conversation
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.600]   about sin and its effects on our ability to view God clearly.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.480]   But then we also realized that God comes to cleanse us
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.160]   and teach us about repentance and to give us new hope
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.480]   to see Him as we should.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.640]   We then learned about a new way to worship.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.920]   Pastor Promise talked to us about how worship isn't just
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.560]   with the songs and melodies, but it's with our lives
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.280]   that we worship.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.040]   Then last week, Pastor Andrew reminded us of our names.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.600]   And he unpacked to us how the labels we give ourselves
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.280]   and the others given to us aren't really our true identity.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.400]   But what truly matters, the true name, the true label,
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.760]   comes from what Jesus has done for us.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.320]   And I hope it's been a good journey for you.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.920]   But here's the thing.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.960]   Your journey in the new things God wants to do
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.280]   doesn't end with this sermon series.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.680]   Because God is living and active in this world
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.800]   and in your life, your journey with Him
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.360]   continues into the future.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.320]   So the future, let's talk about that for a second.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.520]   What will the future be like?
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.640]   What questions, feelings, and emotions
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   come to mind when you think about what
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.600]   the future looks like?
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.760]   What if someone said, hey, Songsong,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.360]   I can tell you exactly what your future looks like.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.760]   What would you say?
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.120]   This is precisely why movies like Back to the Future
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.720]   are so fun to watch.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.640]   Zemeckis tries his very best to pull back the curtain
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.200]   to show us a glimpse.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.160]   But really, nobody knows what the future holds.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.240]   And he was way off, which is precisely, again,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.880]   why we're so obsessed with it.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.600]   This isn't the only movie about future.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.480]   So many, Hollywood is constantly churning out
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.000]   movies about time travel and its potential ramifications,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.160]   butterfly effects, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.600]   Lots of movies about traveling into the future.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.880]   But even on an intellectual level,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.480]   the possibility of moving between time and space
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.920]   is a question physicists and scientists
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.240]   have been debating for a long, long time now.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.960]   Einstein's general theory of relativity--
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.840]   OK, keep your eyes open.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.120]   This opened up the question, though, about what--
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.960]   if time travel is actually possible or not.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.920]   Apparently, this is what E equals mc squared is all about.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.440]   Let me try and explain.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.160]   I'm just kidding.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.400]   I'm not going to go there today.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.920]   But movies and scientific theories are one thing.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.640]   But the idea of wanting to know what
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.440]   might happen in the future is so appealing to us
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.160]   that it even impacts us on a spiritual level.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.360]   Think about this for a minute.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.120]   Many of us are so desperate to find out,
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.640]   to be sure of what the future holds,
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.400]   that we turn to some very dark places to find out the answers.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.080]   Here in this city, all you need to do is go and walk down
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.400]   Temple Street, or go and visit Wangdai
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.840]   Shen or one of the other temples.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.880]   And there'll be no shortage of fortune tellers,
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.440]   card readers, soothsayers, feng shui masters
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.240]   who will claim to know exactly what your future looks like.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.880]   Who are you going to marry?
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.840]   What kind of career are you going to have?
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.880]   How likely you are to get that promotion?
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.160]   When you should have children?
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.800]   How many children are you going to have?
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.760]   How you might even die?
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.680]   All these things can apparently be told
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.080]   by the flip of the card, reading of the charts,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.320]   shaking of some sticks.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.120]   This is very much a part of our culture.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.480]   But how about within our church itself?
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.160]   How about within the Christian community?
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.760]   I think at times, we too have just as much
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.040]   of an interest in these things.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.520]   Only the Christianese, the Christian version of this,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.320]   we call it the prophetic.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.200]   And at times, even amongst us Christians,
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.480]   we have an unhealthy interest of what the future precisely
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.960]   is going to look like.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.240]   And so what happens is that we turn to God.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.840]   But when we turn to God, we only want
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.960]   Him to give us really specific answers.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.680]   So we can always make the right choice.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.400]   We can always be walking in His blessings.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.240]   We can always be on that path to success.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.560]   Now, don't get me wrong, church.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.480]   I'm not saying that God doesn't speak to us in this way.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.880]   And even in scripture, God gives some pretty accurate,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.200]   getting precise prophecies about what
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.320]   might happen in the future.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.520]   And I'm sure scripture tells us God
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.560]   has plans and purposes for your life,
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.560]   blessings that He wants to give to you,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.880]   good things He wants to lead you into.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.680]   This is the truth.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.480]   God is the giver only of good gifts.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.160]   But if this becomes the only way and the only time
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.960]   we look to God, we are missing out on so much.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.240]   It's like there's a huge masterpiece of a painting,
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   and we're only staring at one corner of it.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.400]   So let me ask us, what does your relationship for the future
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.040]   look like?
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.400]   Now, for some of us out there, there
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.280]   might be a lot of excitement.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.560]   For you, there's a lot of good, exciting things
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.920]   coming up on the horizon.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.600]   And you can't wait to see how they all play out.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.880]   If this is you in the room today, good for you.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.040]   But you can probably leave right now or take a nap
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.400]   or start praying for the rest of us.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.280]   Might not relate to what I'm about to say.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.680]   Because for most of us ordinary people out there,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.720]   for those of you watching online as well,
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.160]   as you look into the future, there's
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.640]   probably a lot of concerns and a lot of fears
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.320]   for many different reasons.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.200]   So today, as we close our sermon series,
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.520]   we're going to be in Isaiah 65, verses 17 to 25.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.360]   And as we look through this passage,
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.800]   we're going to take sections of it
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.000]   to see how they can give us hope for the different things we're
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.160]   worried about as we look into the future.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.320]   This is what the passage has to say.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.680]   Verse 17, Isaiah 65.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.280]   "See, I will create new heavens and a new earth.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.080]   The former things will not be remembered,
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.560]   nor will they come to mind.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.240]   But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.840]   For I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.120]   a joy.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.960]   I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.280]   the sound of weeping and crying will be heard in it no more.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.000]   Never again will it be an infant who lives but a few days,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.800]   or an old man who does not live out his years.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.000]   The one who dies at 100 will be thought to be a mere child.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.200]   The one who fails to reach 100 will be considered accursed.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   They will build houses and dwell in them.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.920]   They will build vineyards and eat their fruit.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.560]   No longer will they build houses and others live with them,
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.520]   or plant and others eat.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.720]   For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.480]   My chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.520]   They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.480]   doomed to misfortune.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.720]   For they will be a people blessed by the Lord.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.160]   They and their descendants with them.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.840]   Before they call, I will answer.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.080]   While they are still speaking, I will hear.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.640]   The wolf and the lamb will feed together.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.680]   The lion and the ox will-- and the lion
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.600]   will eat straw like the ox.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.760]   The dust will be the serpent's food.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.440]   They will neither harm nor destroy on my holy mountain,
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.880]   says the Lord."
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.840]   So as we walk through this passage, like I said,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.000]   I'm going to try and highlight some concerns that we
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.480]   might have looking for some hope in this passage
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.920]   that we've just read.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.040]   I hope that sounds OK.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.240]   So here we go.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.280]   Firstly, some of us are worried about the future
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.680]   because of our past experiences.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.120]   There's a scientific term for this,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.200]   and it's called "prospection."
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.080]   And it happens.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.560]   Animals have prospection.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.360]   For example, if you have a pet, especially you have a dog,
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.320]   and you come home at the same time every day,
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.360]   your dog seems to know when you're going to arrive home.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.000]   They anticipate you arriving home at that time.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.840]   And so they start getting excited.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.320]   And at times, if you come home late
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.760]   or you don't come home at the time
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.520]   your pet is expecting you to, they react in a certain way.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.200]   They feel sad.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.080]   They feel depressed.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.520]   Things like that.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.960]   Ravens apparently have the ability to do this.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.800]   They're one of these animals that store up for the winter
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   because of the experience that, hey, in the past winters,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.920]   food has been scarce.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.000]   So let's store up so there's enough food
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.520]   to carry us through the colder months of the year.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.800]   But as humans, our ability to prospect about the future
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.360]   is much higher, which is one of the reasons
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.120]   we find ourselves worrying about what's going to happen to us.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.040]   This is why we do things like saving up
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.240]   for retirement and our kids' education.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.760]   This is why we exercise today hoping
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.840]   to keep fit so we can live out our years on this Earth
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.440]   tomorrow.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.120]   Our ability to prospect is much higher than the normal animals.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.520]   But again, this is why we are worried,
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.800]   because we tend to use memories of our past experience
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.320]   to predict what our life will be like.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.720]   So if you have experienced things
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.480]   that have been difficult and complicated,
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.520]   it becomes hard to see anything else but the same
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.400]   in the future, just suffering and disappointment.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.800]   This is certainly the case of the Israelites.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.760]   During the time such as Isaiah and Jeremiah,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.280]   when these prophets were active in doing the work,
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.600]   the Israelites had been through some really tough things.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   They had been slaves in Egypt.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.880]   They had wandered in the desert for 40 years,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.720]   faced countless battles where hundreds of thousands
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.040]   of their own people have been killed.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.720]   Their temple has been destroyed.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.560]   The holy city of Jerusalem has been turned upside down.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.760]   They've seen the country literally torn in two.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.840]   They've been through terrible kings and leaders and judges.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.520]   And now they've been forcibly moved from their home
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.040]   to a foreign land living in exile.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.080]   So judging from their past, the Israelites
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.600]   really didn't have much to look forward to.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.760]   I wonder if you ever feel like this way in your life.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.560]   I know for myself, this is one of the ways
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.000]   that the future is difficult for me to think about.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.960]   Let me tell you why.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.760]   See, when I was born, I was born with a genetic condition.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.880]   It's just one of those things that happened to me.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.840]   No one else in my family has it, but somehow it landed on me.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.440]   And without going into too much detail,
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.400]   I'll say that it has caused me a great deal of pain in my life,
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.560]   in all different levels.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.960]   Now, with my condition, the thing is, there's a 50/50 chance
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.800]   whether or not I pass it on to my future children,
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.320]   whether my future children will also
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.000]   inherit the same condition.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.600]   And so this is partly my wife and I waited so long
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.160]   to try and have children, because we were praying.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.800]   We were praying for God to not let this happen to our kids.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.080]   And so we prayed before we knew my wife was pregnant.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.400]   We prayed during Brittany's pregnancy.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.320]   We asked many people to pray.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.240]   We asked God to spare Isaiah from the pain
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.640]   that I had to go through.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.520]   But he didn't.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.320]   And shortly after Izzy was born, it
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.040]   was confirmed that he, too, would
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.760]   have to live with what I've had to live with.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.200]   And so to be honest, that was really tough to take.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.920]   It still is.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.600]   I mean, what do you do when the thing you feared most
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.920]   in your life, literally feared most, becomes a reality?
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.520]   And especially now, we're anticipating the arrival
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.200]   of our second child.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.680]   The same doubts, the same fears, the same uncertainty,
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.720]   the same questions keep crossing my mind.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.200]   I thought God promised a good future for our generations.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.000]   But there's nothing good I can see about this.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.720]   And so my own experience of my past
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   begin to cloud my judgment of how I see the future.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.680]   And sometimes I start to think there's no hope.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.520]   So if this is you in the room today,
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.640]   hold on to these words of scripture
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.320]   as some encouragement to you.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.160]   God says this, "See, I will create
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.000]   new heavens and a new earth.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   The former things will not be remembered,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.200]   nor will they come to mind."
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.080]   It's precisely while Israel is in the state of confusion,
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.320]   of darkness, of wrestling with their past
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.160]   and their hopelessness, that God speaks these words,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.640]   "I will create a new heavens and a new earth."
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   These words are an echo of the beginnings of scripture,
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.400]   the very first words of our Bible.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.400]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.360]   And then everything was perfect.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.920]   But this is why the words of Isaiah 65 offer us life,
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.280]   offer us power, offer us hope for the future.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.760]   These are words that let us know,
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.800]   despite our hopelessness, despite the fact
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.480]   that our past experiences have been disappointing,
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.160]   He is going to restore.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.200]   He is going to make things new and right again.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.920]   And His heart is to lead us into that place
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.120]   like we were in the beginning of time in the Garden of Eden,
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.560]   only even better.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.240]   Because in this new place, there is no longer
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.120]   the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.160]   There is only the tree of life, a place
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.480]   where our relationship with God is without barrier,
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.200]   a place where we can be naked and unashamed before the Lord,
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.280]   a place where brokenness will not even be a memory.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.080]   It won't even be a possibility.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.760]   Those things that hurt you in the past
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.160]   will never come to mind again.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.320]   And God's not doing this thing just because He's
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.040]   like a project guy.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.240]   He's bored and He needs something new to do.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.320]   He's doing this thing because it's always
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.280]   been a part of His plan.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.080]   It's an act of love.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.360]   It's an act of rescue and redemption
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.160]   for the sake of His children.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.840]   And so this means that even though you've
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.880]   gone through setbacks and knockdowns,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.000]   there is always hope.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.440]   There is always hope because God acts.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.760]   And contrary to popular belief, the world
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.560]   is not going to hell in a handbasket
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.240]   because when God works, when God decides
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.320]   that He is going to do something new, and when God restores,
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.600]   the effects are going to be so perfect.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.640]   Like I said just now, one day you're
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:45.240]   not even going to remember the disappointments of the past.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.520]   That's a word for you today.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.160]   And just as an answer to my own prayers,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.320]   and I didn't share this with the morning,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.800]   I just remember this, in the things
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.640]   that Isaiah's had to do, a ton of doctor's appointments
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.120]   and all this kind of stuff.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.120]   And actually, we found out that on the year that he was born,
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   there's been a new drug, a new treatment that's
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.080]   come out precisely targeting kids with his condition.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.480]   That's an answer of God that we never thought was possible.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.400]   When I was a kid, definitely that was not an option.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.760]   So we're exploring these things right now.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.720]   But we see that as an answer to how God has been
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.480]   working in our family's life.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.720]   And also come to remember that God's answer to us,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.600]   to our family, was not that He would not
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.680]   inherit it as badly as we wanted that to happen,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.880]   but was the fact that I'm going to be with you in this.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.080]   That was His word to us.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.200]   So take that as an encouragement to you.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.720]   Secondly, some of us in this room
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.080]   are worried about the future because of our own sin
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.280]   and the mistakes that we have made,
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:54.080]   or maybe the mess that we're currently sitting in.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.200]   And so when you look ahead, it's hard
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.360]   to imagine what life might be like if you
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.880]   were to be free from the chains that are binding you right now.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.800]   It's going to be hard.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.640]   It's hard because that's all you've known.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.280]   That's all you've been sitting in for so long now,
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.880]   that your sin has affected how you think about the future.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.720]   It's important to remember and realize
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.160]   that the Israelites were in this miserable position
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.960]   in the first place because of their own sin
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.520]   and their own tendencies to turn away from God
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.640]   and begin to worship idols.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.760]   Their relationship with God was once strong,
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.680]   but now the Israelites were stuck in this futile practice
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.840]   of trying to worship God and do other rituals,
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.800]   but at the same time, continuing to live life on their own terms,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.960]   worshiping idols, doing as the nations around them did.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.200]   It wasn't that God was far away, but they simply
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.560]   refused to listen to Him.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.800]   And because of this, they found themselves
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.680]   suffering in the consequences of their own sin.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.080]   Or in more colloquial terms, they messed around
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.000]   and they found out that sin isn't something
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.480]   you can play with.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.320]   And this may be some of us today.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.360]   Yes, we come to church.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.240]   We're connected to a community group.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:13.880]   We serve.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.440]   We tithe.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.240]   We do all the right things, but we
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.320]   know that we haven't fully surrendered to God.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.360]   We know that our relationship with God
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.520]   is still ruled by darkness in some areas.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.400]   And where your relationship with Him, yes,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.880]   might once have been strong.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.460]   We used to hear from God all the time,
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.920]   but now when we ask God to speak to us,
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.800]   we can't hear anything because of our sin.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.440]   And we feel like we're abandoned.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.220]   You feel like God doesn't like you anymore.
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.280]   And sin has sapped away the joy from your relationship
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.380]   with God.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.680]   For those of you who are in this position,
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.760]   these are the words of encouragement for you today.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.680]   "Be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.560]   For I will create Jerusalem to be a delight,
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.840]   and its people a joy.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.760]   I will rejoice over Jerusalem," and listen to this,
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.720]   "and take delight in my people."
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.400]   So here's the truth.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.440]   Yes, sin does put up a barrier between us and God.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.520]   And there's most definitely consequences to our sins.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.360]   That's for sure.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.760]   But at the same time, when God works,
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.480]   when God renews and restores, He even
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.480]   is able to reverse the effects of sin
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.600]   so that they will no longer be able to separate us
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.520]   from the relationship we can have with God.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.000]   Later on in Isaiah 21, 65, 21, and 22, it says this.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.160]   "They will build houses and dwell in them.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.240]   They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.000]   No longer will they build houses and others live with them
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.320]   or plant and others eat."
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.240]   Now, it seems like a bit of a random passage
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.200]   to throw in there.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.600]   But this is a declaration.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.040]   It's not just a blessing.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.520]   This is God reversing the punishment and the consequences
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.440]   that He had previously warned the Israelites about.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.200]   If you go back to Deuteronomy 28, 30,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.600]   God warns His people that if they disobey Him,
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.960]   if they continue to worship idols and do other things
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.760]   that they're not supposed to do, these
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.720]   are the results that are waiting for them.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.200]   "You will build a house, but you will not live in it.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.000]   You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.680]   begin to enjoy its fruit."
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.120]   That was the warning from God.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.040]   And this is the situation that the Israelites
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.000]   found themselves in.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.640]   But in the new thing that God is doing, in the new heavens,
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.840]   in the new earth, this curse is reversed.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.560]   You see, Jerusalem was always meant
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   to be the symbol of God's presence here on earth,
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.220]   but has since then been corrupted by sin
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.320]   and as a result, destroyed by pagan worshipping armies
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.680]   back in the day.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.920]   But even so, it says, God will restore it
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.560]   to its rightful place of bringing delight to God.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.600]   The same goes for you.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.360]   You who think because of your sin,
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.040]   there is no hope for your future.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.680]   You who think God doesn't want anything
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.960]   to do with you anymore because of your sin.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.680]   This is an encouragement for you,
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.680]   because God's heart is still to bring you out of the darkness
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.720]   into the light.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.760]   God's heart is to create in you a new person, a new heart
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.880]   to restore the joy that sin has eaten away.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.200]   You are part of his people.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.240]   You belong to him.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.760]   And because of this, he takes delight in you.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.800]   There is hope.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:47.720]   Some of us, when we look to the future,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.600]   our view of the future is jaded because despite
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.920]   of our hard work, despite of our best efforts,
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.520]   nothing ever seems to pay off.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.940]   And so we feel like we should just stop trying and give up,
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.240]   because well, what's the point?
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.240]   Nothing ever comes to fruition anyway.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.920]   If you're a student in this room, you might understand.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.640]   You might play out like this.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.280]   You find yourself studying.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.600]   That big exam is coming.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.000]   So you bust your butt.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.120]   You stay up late.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.880]   You work hard.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.680]   You do all the preparation.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.840]   You go to the extra classes.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.000]   And when on results day, when you take the exam and results
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.440]   day, they come out, you failed.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.120]   Or you've missed it by like half a mark or something like that.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.000]   And it's just so soul crushing.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.560]   You don't know what to do.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.280]   I thought I worked hard.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.400]   Or on the contrary, you get the results that you wanted,
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.360]   even good marks.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.880]   But even then, you don't get any praise or accreditation,
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.720]   because that's just what's expected of you
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.920]   in the first place.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.680]   This might play out for you in the workplace.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.840]   You spend endless hours working in the office,
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.960]   staying late, making sure everything is done right.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.520]   You go above and beyond.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.080]   You do the things that nobody else does to make
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.760]   sure nothing falls apart.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   But in the end, you never get the credit for it.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.920]   Your boss never seems to notice.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.880]   And even worse, it's the people around you
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.800]   that seem to do no work, that ride off
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.000]   the coattails of other people's hard work, that slack off.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.640]   These are the people that get the raises and the promotions.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:26.640]   Maybe this plays out for you in your relationships.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.760]   You finally think you found the right person for you.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.960]   So you do all the right things.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.920]   You open up.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   You communicate.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.640]   You're vulnerable.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.800]   You're authentic.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.400]   You give this person your trust.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.200]   You share your deepest, most intimate feelings, thoughts,
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.640]   and emotions with this person.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.120]   You even invest your resources into this relationship,
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.520]   only to have your heart broken yet again.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:54.040]   If this is you, hold on to these words
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.240]   as a source of encouragement.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.200]   "For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.480]   My chosen ones will enjoy the work of the hands.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.080]   They will not labor in vain, nor will they
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.280]   bear children doomed to misfortune,
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.120]   for they will be a people blessed by the Lord."
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.360]   In the new thing God is doing, in the new heavens
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.880]   and the new earth that God is leading you into,
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:27.000]   he tells us that your efforts will never return void.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.760]   But rather, God sees your efforts.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.640]   He notices the journey that you've been on.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.000]   He sees the hard work that you've been putting in.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.120]   And his promise is that you will be blessed for this in the end.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.800]   So take heart.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.400]   Some of us don't want even to think about the future,
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.840]   because all we can see is pain.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.720]   It's similar to what we talked about just now.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.480]   We don't want to dream or think about what
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.400]   could be, because we don't want to get our hopes up just
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.720]   to have them dashed again.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.880]   There were plans that you had, visions
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.840]   that you had for your future.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.840]   But instead of seeing life blossom,
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:11.200]   you've experienced a lot of loss, a miscarriage,
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.600]   the untimely passing of a loved one,
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.680]   the break off of an engagement, a divorce, loss
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.320]   of jobs and finances, a horrible diagnosis,
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.400]   the breakdown of a friendship that was once strong.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.760]   As a pastor in this community, I've sat with you
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.600]   and walked with many of you through these things.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.640]   I myself have walked in these things.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:40.840]   And so if this is you today, take this as your encouragement.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.360]   In this new heavens and the new earth,
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.680]   the sound of weeping and crying will be heard in it no more.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:52.440]   Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.080]   days or an old man who does not live out his years.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.360]   The one who dies at 100 will be thought a mere child.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.960]   The one who fails to reach 100 will be considered accursed.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   God promises us that there is a future coming where things
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.160]   like this will no longer happen.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.640]   There is a future coming where life will always blossom
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.360]   and live out to its full potential.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.280]   There is a time coming where your efforts will bear the fruit
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.880]   that you've been praying that it will bear.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.240]   This is what the heart of the passage is trying to say.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.160]   It's a poetic way of reminding us that in the new heavens
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:35.560]   and the new earth, pain will no longer be the ending.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.120]   But rather, as Jesus has said, we will get to enjoy life
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.360]   and life in the full.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.960]   Some of us don't see much hope in the future because we feel
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.760]   like God has given up on us.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.440]   And I'm talking to the ones out there who've been serving
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.600]   the Lord faithfully.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.080]   You've been serving God faithfully.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:02.560]   You've really tried to live a life free from sin.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.160]   You are dedicated in your walk with God.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.760]   You've poured yourself out for the sake of your gospel.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.360]   You have sacrificed.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.200]   And whilst you've seen God work powerfully
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.560]   in other people's lives, you feel as though God
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.040]   has given up on you.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.240]   The blessings that you pray for other people
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.800]   never seem to come your way.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.120]   And so it feels like God doesn't really care about you.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.600]   And you're about one unanswered prayer
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.040]   from giving up on your relationship with God
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.040]   altogether.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:39.960]   My brother, my sister, if this is you today, hang on.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.680]   Take this as a word of encouragement to you.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.120]   Before they call, I will answer.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.360]   While they are still speaking, I will hear.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.040]   God is reminding us of His intimacy with us in this verse.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.960]   This is a reassurance that He is still listening to you.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.520]   He knows you so well that He anticipates your needs.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.280]   God is like that best friend, that person
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.720]   that you're most in tune with.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.160]   You know that person who seems to be able to complete
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.120]   your sentences for you?
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.720]   The person who knows your most innermost thoughts,
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.600]   the friend who hears you, who understands you,
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.280]   who will never give up on you.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.600]   God has not given up on you, which
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.200]   is precisely why He's doing the new thing that He's
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.040]   promised us.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.760]   Now I know what you're thinking, too.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.840]   This all sounds good in theory, but the truth
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.560]   is I'm still struggling right now.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.440]   The truth is when I wake up tomorrow,
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.680]   most likely I'm still going to be carrying some
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.840]   of that pain and uncertainty.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.960]   And if God is doing all these things in the end,
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.560]   then why do we need to bother with anything?
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.920]   Well, what's the point?
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.200]   Why don't we just sit around and wait for it to happen,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.960]   let God do His thing?
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.280]   Why is God showing us these things?
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.320]   Is it just to tantalize us, to try and give us
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.000]   a little bit of hope and just make us impatient and long
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.200]   for these things to come?
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.840]   No.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.000]   God is pulling back the curtain to show us
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.640]   a glimpse of what the future might be like,
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.920]   because it's actually an invitation for us
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.840]   to join Him in this work of making things new,
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.480]   in this work of restoration.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.960]   This is one of the most challenging yet most exciting
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.840]   things about being in a vibrant relationship with the living
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.040]   God, because our role is not to sit around dreaming and hoping
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.680]   of better things to come, but God
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.840]   has called us to actively take part in shaping the future.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.440]   God chose us the future, yes, in some ways, of course,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.600]   to give us hope for tomorrow, but also
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.960]   to move us into action today.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.680]   So this is what we mean when we say things
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.480]   like we want God's heart.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.600]   This is what we mean when we sing songs like,
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.360]   show me how to love like you have loved me.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.640]   Break my heart for what breaks yours.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.400]   God doesn't show us visions to tantalize our imagination,
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.720]   to make us homesick for our home in heaven,
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.880]   but rather, He is asking us to embrace these things
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.480]   and join Him in His work of revealing His restoration
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.680]   to the rest of the world.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.840]   A commentary I was researching in preparation for this message
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.760]   put it this way, "No goal short of the restoration
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.320]   of all God's creation to its intended wholeness
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.880]   will satisfy the yearning of the servant of the Lord."
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.280]   So what this means is this, the things
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.560]   that you've gone through, even the terrible, horrible things
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.440]   that you're going through, have gone through,
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.440]   the disappointments, the heartbreak, the grief,
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.640]   and the mourning, all these things
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.440]   can be the help and understanding that
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.240]   is needed to guide you in how you can contribute
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:56.000]   to God's vision of this new heavens and the new earth.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.240]   Revelation 21, 1 to 4, in an echo of what Isaiah says,
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:04.120]   tells us this, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.520]   The first heaven and first earth had passed away,
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.280]   and there was no longer any sea.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.160]   I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem,
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.720]   coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride,
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.040]   beautifully dressed for a husband.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.560]   And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.240]   'Look, God's dwelling place is now among the people,
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.560]   and He will dwell with them.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.560]   They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.240]   and be their God.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.000]   He will wipe every tear from their eyes.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.360]   for the old order of things has passed away.'"
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.520]   This church is where the world is heading.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.120]   And I know we're in this awkward stage
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.720]   right now where we already know how the story is going to end,
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.200]   but we're not there yet.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.440]   The beautiful thing about knowing how the story ends,
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.360]   though, is that we get to live for that moment right now.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.040]   We get to live like we're in the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.160]   God is saying to His people, "I see your hurt.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.680]   I see your pain.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.960]   I see the uncertainties.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.320]   I understand why you might have questions about how
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.800]   the future is going to turn out.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.680]   But don't let the loss of right now define your future.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.240]   Trust me.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.120]   Let me define the future."
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.920]   So in light of this, allow me to challenge us
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.120]   with a few questions.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:40.000]   Where in the world do you see the need for God's restoration?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.720]   What breaks your heart as you look out
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.240]   into the community and the world around you?
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:50.040]   What has God called you to do to shape the future?
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.880]   And ultimately, what are you going to do about it?
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.440]   This is your God-given calling.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.840]   This is what your future looks like.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.640]   This is how your future works out, by doing the holy work
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.680]   of God's restoration.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.280]   And God is ready to lead you in these things.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.720]   God is standing there saying, "Here I am.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.320]   Here I am."
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.680]   God is asking the question, "Behold, I am doing a new thing.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.920]   Do you perceive it?"
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.720]   God is asking the question, "Are you
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.320]   ready to do the good works He has prepared in advance for you
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:28.840]   to do?"
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.920]   Our calling as followers of Jesus
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.120]   is to start doing this today, right now.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.000]   Because for those of us who are in Christ Jesus,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.280]   we have already had a taste of what this feels like, right?
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.200]   When you decided to give your life to Jesus,
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.200]   when you decided to surrender to Christ,
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.720]   you went through a renewal.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.960]   Bible tells us that anyone who is in Christ,
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.880]   he is what?
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   A new creation.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.240]   The old has gone.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.920]   The new has come.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.000]   The new has come.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.640]   So therefore, as a people who have been through renewal,
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.080]   our role now is to bring renewal to this world that
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.720]   still desperately needs it.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.880]   So I'm sorry, church.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.760]   I know I haven't told you clearly
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.160]   about what your future is going to look like.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.760]   I really wish I could say to everyone
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.200]   that it's nothing but blue skies and sunshine up ahead.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.480]   I wish I could guarantee you and your family members
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.840]   are going to be healthy, prosperous, and happy
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.640]   for the rest of their lives.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.120]   I wish I could tell you that there's
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.280]   going to be peace in all your relationships.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.840]   I wish I could tell you that you're
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.680]   going to meet the love of your life,
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.040]   have the family of your dreams.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.640]   But I can't.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.280]   And as we prayed for today, the fact,
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.840]   chances are that in the future, there's still
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.560]   some tough things coming along.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.120]   Because the truth is, we're not yet in this new heavens
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.880]   and the new earth.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.920]   And for the time being, they're going
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:01.440]   to be failed dreams, untimely deaths, sickness, fear,
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.680]   conflict, misfortune.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.400]   But what I do know is this.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:12.360]   The God who created his earth, the God we serve,
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.520]   the all-powerful, all-loving God who sent his son Jesus
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.240]   to die on the cross, who raised him from the dead,
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.880]   has defeated the powers of sin and death and hopelessness.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.560]   And what I do know is that God has in store for you
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.120]   is far beyond what you can even ask or imagine.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.840]   What I do know is that our God is
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:37.680]   in the process of redeeming and renewing this world.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:43.600]   And one day, this will come into completion.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.560]   What I do know, he's inviting all of us
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.440]   to join in with him in this process.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.760]   God is leading you into a new future.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.800]   Will you see it, church?
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.840]   Will you act upon it?
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.080]   Will you respond in obedience to the renewal
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.640]   God wants to do through you?
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.960]   I'm going to invite you to pray.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:25.600]   And as we were preparing for the services this morning,
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.560]   one of the things that was mentioned was there's people
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.280]   I know coming to the services today
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.760]   who have some very specific things that they're
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.560]   worried about coming up.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.040]   An operation, an interview, a conversation
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.920]   that they need to have, some big decision that
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   needs to be made.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.960]   Excuse me.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.000]   They're searching right now for the answers.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.760]   And that uncertainty is causing a lot of fear.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:57.400]   And you don't know how it's going to work out.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.560]   So if that's you in the room right now,
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.560]   if you have something specific that you know it's coming up
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.680]   and you know you need God's guidance in it,
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.560]   you know you need Him to intervene or help you
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.080]   in some way, I invite you to open your hands just
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.280]   as a sign of surrendering it to God right now.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:31.520]   And as you do that, be reassured that the Lord is with you.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.600]   And Jesus is for you.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:43.160]   Holy Spirit is going to be guiding you and protecting you.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.240]   The God who will walk with you through the valleys,
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.240]   it's the same God who will lead you to the still waters,
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.680]   to the green pastures.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.520]   And so Father, for my brothers and sisters
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.680]   with their hands open right now who
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.240]   are anticipating something that really
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.920]   needs you to show them and guide them and lead them
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.840]   into the right thing, the good thing that they should do,
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.760]   Father, I pray that you would walk with them, guide them,
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.000]   lead them, give them strength, give them hope.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:19.320]   And also there's some of us who have
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.720]   been worried about the future and perhaps
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.440]   have turned to some of those things that are outside of you.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.480]   And it's led them to some very dark places.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.320]   It's led them to trust and bind themselves
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.600]   to certain things that are not holy and not from you.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.000]   If that's you today, you can also
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.480]   open up your hands right now if you
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.640]   feel comfortable to do that.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:48.720]   Lord, and I pray that you would release them
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.560]   from things not of you that are binding them.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:56.760]   Release any lies that have been spoken out
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.200]   over them in this process, anything that's not from you,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:00.700]   Lord.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:09.920]   And help them to let go of what is not from you
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.140]   and hold on to your love and your guidance,
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.080]   even though it might seem in some ways a bit more uncertain,
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:25.040]   a bit more murky in that way.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.760]   But we know our God is for us, that he'll never
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.880]   lead us astray, that he'll never lead us things that he cannot
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.080]   continue to guide us through, because he loves us.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:43.600]   And for the rest of us, Lord, use
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   us to do the work of restoration.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.720]   Lord, this world is a broken place.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:56.920]   Our communities, our families, our schools,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.880]   and people are longing for hope.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.960]   People are longing for renewal.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.080]   And yes, we anticipate.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.280]   We can't wait for the day, Lord, you come back
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.000]   and everything will finally be made right once and for all.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.360]   But until that day comes, Lord, give us the courage
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.120]   to live as that is already here, to bring your kingdom on Earth
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.680]   as it is in heaven.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.400]   And this is the way, Lord.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.680]   This is the way you've called us to live as your followers,
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:28.240]   trusting in you, building our lives on the foundation
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.440]   that you have set for us, and bringing your love to those
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.480]   who are seeking it, Lord.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:38.360]   So we thank you for this.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.120]   Walk with us, Jesus.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.320]   We thank you for your love for us.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.400]   And we love you too, Lord.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.000]   Amen.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.960]   You join me in standing with the worship team.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.300]   we're gonna end our time by just singing a song together.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.880]   (upbeat music)
