1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 in Jesus' name, everyone says, amen, amen, amen.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,940
 (congregation applauding)

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,800
 You can have a seat.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,460
 So God has just met Moses at a burning bush.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,600
 God has appeared out of nowhere

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,560
 and into the ordinary everyday moment of Moses' life,

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,480
 God comes and creates this burning bush

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,300
 just off in the distance to his right,

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,800
 or maybe it was to his left,

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,260
 but just off there in the distance.

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,980
 And God does it there and not right in front of him

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,800
 because God wants to call him to leave his everyday,

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,460
 to leave his ordinary and to go and see what it is

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,180
 that's burning just over there on the horizon.

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,060
 And Moses has to make a choice.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,540
 He has to make a choice to decide

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,500
 to draw towards the extraordinary.

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,780
 And I wanna encourage you to be open

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,480
 to making that choice in your life

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,600
 because there are burning bushes

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,300
 that God places around us all the time.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,740
 And maybe for us, they're not like some flame in a bush,

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,220
 but maybe it's somebody that we meet on the street.

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,420
 Maybe it's a new colleague at work.

25
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,540
 Maybe it's a moment in a conversation with someone.

26
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,220
 Maybe we're at a bar or a nightclub or a restaurant

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,540
 or somewhere where we didn't even think God was present.

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,380
 And there is a burning bush before us.

29
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,340
 I wanna empower you as people here in Hong Kong

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,540
 to walk boldly towards the burning bushes,

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,140
 to recognize that God often breaks into our ordinary

32
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,100
 with his extraordinary.

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,420
 And when he does, it's chance and time for us to turn

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,180
 and walk and listen and hear.

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,460
 And as Moses goes over, God says these words to him,

36
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,300
 "Don't come any closer, Moses,

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,040
 "for the ground that you're standing on is holy ground."

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,220
 And he invites him to remove his sandals.

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,180
 And Moses does so.

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,480
 And we saw last week that that had something to do

41
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,440
 with the impurities that Moses had on his shoes

42
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,560
 and the holiness of God,

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,300
 but it actually had far more to do

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,700
 with God's desire to be an intimate community

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,940
 with Moses again,

46
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,940
 with God's desire to break through all the things

47
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,180
 that had happened in Moses's life

48
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,420
 and meet Moses tenderly, intimately in communion with him,

49
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,580
 taking Moses back to Genesis one and two,

50
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,460
 where Adam and Eve were able to be naked and unashamed

51
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,780
 in God's presence before the onset of sin.

52
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,620
 And despite all the sin that had been in Moses's life

53
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,820
 and was continuing to be in his life,

54
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,540
 God says, "Remove your sandals

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,580
 "'cause I want you to be naked and unashamed with me again,

56
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,220
 "that nothing you have done, nothing you have said,

57
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,260
 "nothing you have lived would ever take you.

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,000
 "Nothing is an obstacle

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,900
 "from my intimate relationship with you.

60
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,880
 "I love you.

61
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,020
 "I'm here for you.

62
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,040
 "I wanna connect with you.

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,300
 "I want your flesh and my spirit to be together."

64
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,020
 And God invites Moses into something

65
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,540
 that he invites us all into,

66
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,900
 to know that nothing we do can ever hold us back

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,100
 from the grace of God.

68
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,780
 And that God wants to intimately commune with us too.

69
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,080
 He wants you to be naked and unashamed.

70
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,440
 And Moses's response to this incredible call of God

71
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,600
 for him to be naked and unashamed before him again

72
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,440
 is simple words.

73
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,480
 He says, "Here I am."

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,280
 Not kind of like, "Here I am."

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,080
 But, "Here I am.

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
 "All of me.

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,260
 "The good, the bad, the ugly.

78
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,160
 "The me that was for 40 years an oppressor in Egypt.

79
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,620
 "The me that murdered an Egyptian

80
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,840
 "and thought he could bury it and get away with it.

81
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,040
 "The me that fled because I was in fear of my life.

82
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,120
 "Me that came to a new place

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,200
 "and pretended that I was somebody that I wasn't.

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,200
 "All of me, I now step into you.

85
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,560
 "I now bring to you."

86
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,600
 And it's in this amazing moment of intimacy

87
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,080
 that God ministers to Moses.

88
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,380
 And it's here at this moment,

89
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,960
 when God finally calls Moses

90
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,040
 to what the true purpose of his life was.

91
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,380
 And I need you to hear this.

92
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,640
 Moses was 80 years old.

93
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,880
 Adrian, I need you to hear this.

94
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,080
 Come on, baby.

95
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,320
 Moses was 80 years old at this point in his life,

96
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,620
 just like Adrian was standing here before you right now.

97
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,880
 And God said, "Now is the time for your purpose.

98
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,720
 "Now is the time."

99
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,200
 Everything that's happened in the last 80 years

100
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,040
 has shaped and formed you

101
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,760
 to be the one that I can now use, yes.

102
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,480
 But now is the time

103
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,160
 that you're about to live out the calling in your life.

104
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,080
 And there are some of you in this room

105
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,620
 who are older than I am,

106
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,680
 who think that you're at the end,

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,780
 when actually you're at the beginning.

108
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,000
 You're actually at a moment now with all the wisdom

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,480
 and all the life experience

110
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,780
 and all the gifting and anointing

111
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,080
 that has been placed upon your life.

112
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,760
 Now God's rolling up his sleeves

113
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,000
 and he's saying, "Are you ready?

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,720
 "Because your purpose is still here."

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,400
 And so for this 80-year-old man

116
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,080
 who's standing naked before God

117
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,520
 and for the first time in 80 years, unashamed,

118
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,740
 God gives him a call.

119
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,460
 I wanna read this to you from Exodus 3, verse 7.

120
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,460
 The Lord said,

121
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,380
 "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt.

122
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,280
 "I've heard them crying out because of their slave drives

123
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,020
 "and I'm concerned about their suffering.

124
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,280
 "So I've come down to rescue them

125
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,400
 "from the hand of the Egyptians,

126
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,380
 "to bring them up out of that land

127
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,560
 "into a good and spacious land,

128
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,920
 "a land flowing with milk and honey,

129
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,940
 "the home of the Canaanites, the Hittites,

130
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,020
 "the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites,

131
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,100
 "the Jebusites, every ite you could ever imagine is there."

132
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,060
 I love this, God shows up and Moses is removed his sandals

133
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,260
 and he's communing with God,

134
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,580
 the naked and unashamed moment.

135
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,420
 And then God begins to speak to him.

136
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,860
 And the first thing he does is he reminds Moses of who he is.

137
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,540
 He reminds him of his heart of compassion.

138
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,660
 And we saw this just a couple of weeks ago

139
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,700
 at the end of chapter two, when God declares his character.

140
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,960
 And he says back in chapter two,

141
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,960
 "I have heard, I have remembered, I have seen, and I know."

142
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,580
 And because of this, if you remember,

143
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,020
 I drew that out on the whiteboard two weeks ago.

144
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,300
 And because of this, God is saying, this is who I am.

145
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,140
 This is my character.

146
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,580
 I'm a God who hears.

147
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,540
 I'm a God who remembers.

148
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,380
 I'm a God who sees.

149
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,340
 I'm a God who knows.

150
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,660
 I'm for you, he says.

151
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,340
 And then right here, as he begins to minister to Moses,

152
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,420
 and as he begins to give Moses his call on his life,

153
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,460
 he reminds him of all of this.

154
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,140
 Notice what it says here in chapter three, verse seven.

155
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,660
 He says, "I've indeed seen the misery of my people.

156
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,200
 "I've heard them crying out

157
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,320
 "because they're a slave drivers.

158
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,280
 "I'm concerned about their suffering,

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,620
 "so I know about their suffering.

160
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,260
 "And now I have come down to rescue them.

161
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,340
 "I'm gonna be faithful to my covenant

162
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
 "of deliverance for my people."

163
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,940
 He lays it all out there again,

164
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,540
 because he wants Moses to know

165
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,600
 that everything God is doing

166
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,760
 is out of a place of compassion.

167
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,180
 And although God is gonna do more of this later

168
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,220
 in the journey of Exodus, at this moment,

169
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,560
 he wants Moses to be reminded

170
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,260
 that he's not like the Egyptian gods.

171
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,960
 The Egyptian gods who are a pantheon of gods

172
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,940
 who have a hierarchy of power,

173
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,940
 where the Egyptian gods enslave other gods,

174
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,700
 which therefore makes no sense

175
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,580
 why then humans would enslave people

176
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,820
 if their gods enslave people.

177
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,600
 God shows up and says, "I don't enslave people.

178
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,580
 "I actually am turned towards people.

179
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,740
 "My heart is compassion for people.

180
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,980
 "And I hear their cry, and I'm going to act."

181
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,180
 And Moses, you can almost sense in this part of the story,

182
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,160
 it's probably like, "Yeah, great, let's go."

183
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,700
 He's thinking God's gonna go do something.

184
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,740
 He has no idea God's about to call him

185
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,240
 to the hardest thing.

186
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,640
 He actually says here, he says, "I'm gonna now send you.

187
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,620
 "And I'm gonna go and take the Egyptians

188
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,240
 "and to bring them up out of that land

189
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,220
 "into a new and spacious land."

190
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,060
 This is the first mention of this idea of the promised land

191
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,460
 that God is gonna do for his people.

192
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,500
 And he mentions two things about this promised land.

193
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,180
 He says, "First of all, it'll be a land

194
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,920
 "flowing with milk and honey."

195
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,620
 This is a phrase that will get repeated a lot

196
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,420
 throughout both Exodus and Deuteronomy and Numbers.

197
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,940
 The idea that the promised land

198
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,580
 is not actually literally flowing with milk and honey.

199
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,140
 What it is, is it's a place of fruitfulness,

200
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,320
 a place of great blessing, a place of abundance.

201
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,420
 It's God saying, "I'm gonna take you

202
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,100
 "out of a place of slavery

203
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,180
 "and put you into a place of abundance."

204
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,180
 You need to know that as you come out of the slavery

205
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,660
 to your sin, your destination is abundance.

206
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,340
 Not abundance financially per se,

207
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,860
 not abundance maybe even in the things

208
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,020
 that you might want abundance in,

209
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,100
 but the abundance in how God sees fruitfulness

210
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,220
 in this world.

211
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,000
 The abundance of the kingdom of God at work in your life

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,300
 like it never been before.

213
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,820
 Abundance in God's presence with you

214
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,580
 like you've perhaps never felt before.

215
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,420
 There's always a place of abundance

216
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,760
 after a place of slavery.

217
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,320
 Come on, church.

218
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,180
 And so as he's journeying his people here,

219
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,420
 he's saying this land is gonna flow with milk and honey.

220
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,580
 It's like Genesis 1 and 2.

221
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,020
 It's like a new garden for you

222
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,120
 where you're gonna be able to live out

223
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,740
 what it means to truly be human,

224
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,300
 where you're gonna be able to go into the earth

225
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,380
 and subdue it and see it flourish

226
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,080
 and see it become all that it can be.

227
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,140
 That's ahead of you.

228
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,060
 But he says something really important.

229
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,620
 He says, "This is the home of the,"

230
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,220
 and then he says, "Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites,

231
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,460
 "Parasites," and they're all there again.

232
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,100
 In other words, he's saying, "I have a promise for you.

233
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,040
 "It's a land that is incredibly fruitful,

234
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,380
 "but right now it's occupied by other people.

235
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,300
 "It's the home of all these other people,"

236
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,940
 which is really fascinating

237
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,180
 'cause God is saying, "I've got a promise for you,

238
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,600
 "but there's a part that you're gonna have to play

239
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,280
 "in receiving of that promise.

240
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,420
 "There's a whole bunch of people there that you're gonna,"

241
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,740
 now this is right at the beginning of the Exodus,

242
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,260
 and God's gonna talk about this a lot more

243
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
 as they go, but even at the start,

244
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,540
 God's not giving empty promises.

245
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,780
 He's not saying, "Hey, it's a great land.

246
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,680
 "Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

247
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,500
 "I'll tell you about the rest later."

248
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,220
 Right up front, he's saying, "No, this is a land,

249
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,300
 "but it's the home of these people right now,"

250
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,160
 which means it's a promise that is given to you,

251
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,020
 but it's a promise that's gonna need conquering.

252
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,580
 And it's really important that you understand

253
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,020
 how the promises of God work in our lives.

254
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,820
 It's very rarely that the promises of God

255
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,780
 are given to us on a silver platter.

256
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,400
 In fact, the promises of God are actually,

257
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,000
 I think, and over my experience of a number of years

258
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,200
 of serving Christ, I think the promises of God

259
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,460
 are the primary way by which God disciples us as his people.

260
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,680
 Because think of it this way.

261
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,680
 So often, when God wants to give us something,

262
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,120
 something that is so good to us,

263
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,280
 when he wants to do something that's good for us,

264
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,540
 he will demand something good from us.

265
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,600
 And this is because God sees his promises

266
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,640
 that work in our lives, and he wants to partner with us.

267
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,720
 You know, in the promises of God,

268
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,780
 we are not silent passengers.

269
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,040
 We are active partners.

270
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,560
 Now, be careful here, because that doesn't mean

271
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,840
 that your strength and your great wisdom and your ability

272
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,460
 will bring about the promises of God in your life.

273
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,400
 That's not what this is talking about.

274
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,280
 What it's talking about, though,

275
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,780
 is that you're gonna have to align yourself

276
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,160
 to the promises that God has spoken over you.

277
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,800
 And that's gonna require three things,

278
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,520
 obedience, trust, and faith.

279
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,360
 And it wasn't gonna be Moses's strength

280
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,700
 and Moses's wisdom and all the things

281
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,160
 that Moses is great at that would get Israel

282
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,100
 out of Egypt and into the promised land.

283
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,400
 And it wasn't gonna be all those things

284
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,280
 that Joshua would have that would enable them

285
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,560
 to conquer the promised land.

286
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,560
 What would enable that was obedience, trust, and faith.

287
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,200
 And some of you in this room, you're struggling with this,

288
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
 because you're asking for the promises of God,

289
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,880
 but you're not willing to play your part in those promises.

290
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,600
 And every promise that he will speak over your life

291
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,520
 will always call you to a deeper level of discipleship.

292
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,560
 It'll always call you to walk in obedience and faith

293
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,680
 and trust in the promise that God has spoken over you.

294
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,040
 And God is doing this for Moses, 'cause he's saying,

295
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,760
 "I'm gonna do all this stuff, but Moses,

296
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,240
 "there's a role for you to play here."

297
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,960
 And God is inviting Moses to be willing to play his part.

298
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,340
 Will you have the obedience and trust and faith, Moses,

299
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,040
 to walk with me?

300
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,640
 And I feel like the Holy Spirit is saying to us

301
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,280
 here in Hong Kong in this hour,

302
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,200
 will you, the Church of Hong Kong,

303
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
 have the obedience, trust, and faith

304
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,400
 to see the 90% of this city who don't know me come to faith?

305
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,440
 So I think he has a promise over Hong Kong.

306
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,440
 Maybe I'm the only one here

307
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,960
 that thinks God has a promise over Hong Kong.

308
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,840
 Anyone else think that God maybe has

309
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,280
 a promise over Hong Kong, right?

310
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,000
 (congregation applauding)

311
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,040
 But the church is sorely mistaken

312
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
 if we think God is gonna deliver

313
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,420
 that promise on a silver platter.

314
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,340
 We need to rise up in obedience.

315
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,120
 We need to rise up in trust.

316
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,720
 We need to rise up in faith

317
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 if we really wanna see our city changed for Jesus Christ.

318
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,160
 Now, how does Moses reply to this?

319
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,600
 Notice what he says here.

320
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,560
 He says, it says verse nine, he says,

321
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,200
 "Now the cry of the Israelites has reached me,

322
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,540
 "and I've seen the way that the Egyptians

323
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,340
 "are oppressing them, so now go.

324
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,660
 "I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people,

325
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,080
 "the Israelites, out of Egypt.

326
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,280
 "But Moses said to God, 'Who am I,

327
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,820
 "'that I should go to Pharaoh

328
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,080
 "'and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?'"

329
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,680
 Moses' honest words, "Who am I?"

330
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,280
 This portrays two things about Moses.

331
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,280
 The first is he's come a long way.

332
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,600
 'Cause 40 years ago, he was like, look at me.

333
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,960
 40 years ago, he was the prince of Egypt.

334
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,640
 40 years ago, he was clothed in power and prestige

335
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,560
 so much so that he thought he could kill an Egyptian

336
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,620
 and get away with it.

337
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,460
 Now, 40 years later, he is so stripped down

338
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,980
 of all his identity, all his privilege, all of his power,

339
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,260
 that when God shows up and says,

340
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,780
 "I'm gonna take you back to Egypt,"

341
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,060
 he's like, "You should've done that 40 years ago."

342
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,300
 Can you hear Moses' heart here?

343
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,940
 Like, I'm nothing now.

344
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,700
 Why didn't you come 40 years ago and ask me to do it then?

345
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,900
 'Cause then I had power, then I had prestige,

346
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,540
 then I had influence, now I'm nothing.

347
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,660
 You're 40 years late, God.

348
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,400
 I wonder if anyone in this room feels like

349
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,780
 the promises of God are a bit late in their life.

350
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,780
 Like if only, God, you had called me 10 years ago

351
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,700
 when I had that great job and all that money.

352
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,540
 Come on, church.

353
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,380
 So interesting that we put the timeframes of God

354
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,980
 in our hands and God's like, "No, no, no, no, no, Moses.

355
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,460
 "You don't realize now is the time

356
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,260
 "because you saying, 'Who am I?'

357
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,720
 "is the qualification for me to about to use you."

358
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,900
 'Cause notice the, "Who am I?" though.

359
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,060
 There's another thing that's going on here.

360
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,060
 The, "Who am I?" is Moses still thinking it's all about him.

361
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,260
 Whereas before in Egypt, it was, "Who am I?

362
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,420
 "I'm a power, I have authority, I have prestige."

363
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,760
 Now he's like, "Who am I?

364
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,440
 "I have nothing, I'm a shepherd with nothing at all."

365
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,940
 But he still thinks that the ability for him

366
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,420
 to live out the call of God in his life

367
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,060
 is still down to him.

368
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,700
 He's just gone from, "Yeah, I've got all the power,"

369
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,800
 to, "No, I've got no power," but he's still focused on this.

370
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,640
 "Who am I?

371
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
 "How can I do this?"

372
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,500
 Basically, Moses is saying, "I am not adequate, God,

373
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,740
 "to be able to do the call that you've placed on my life.

374
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,940
 "I'm not adequate, I don't have the skills,

375
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,900
 "I don't have the ability,

376
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,480
 "I certainly don't have the power and prestige

377
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,320
 "that I used to have.

378
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,060
 "I am not adequate, God,

379
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,780
 "for what it is that you're calling for me to do."

380
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,740
 Now, here's the reality.

381
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,700
 I think so many of us in this room,

382
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,100
 that's so often been our conversation with God.

383
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,340
 When God calls us to things,

384
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,040
 it's so easy for us to say, "I'm not adequate.

385
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,340
 "I don't have the skills to do that."

386
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,180
 I remember when God called me

387
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,500
 to be senior pastor here at the Vine.

388
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,280
 My great cry was, "I'm inadequate.

389
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,220
 "I don't have the adequacy to live out this call."

390
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,460
 And you can ask my wife,

391
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,180
 "I still feel that way 10 years later."

392
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,300
 It's a miracle that you come every Sunday.

393
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,640
 Literally, that's the grace of God over my life,

394
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,020
 that you guys still show up and come here every Sunday.

395
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,360
 'Cause if you understood how inadequate I feel

396
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,820
 to do what I do, you may not come every Sunday.

397
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,940
 The grace of God is that way.

398
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,660
 I wanna say something really important,

399
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,140
 and I'm gonna put it very bluntly.

400
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,600
 When it comes to the call of God on our lives,

401
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,540
 our adequacy has nothing to do with God's sufficiency.

402
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,800
 Come on, church.

403
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,920
 Has nothing to do with God's sufficiency.

404
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,840
 See, God is sufficient,

405
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,560
 regardless of whether we feel we're adequate or not.

406
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,200
 God's not asking Moses whether he's adequate.

407
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,840
 When God calls you to something,

408
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,000
 he's not looking to see if you're adequate for it.

409
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,280
 He's not looking at your resume and going,

410
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,700
 "Oh, this guy's qualified."

411
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,180
 In fact, I think God chooses people

412
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,640
 because they're not adequate.

413
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,160
 God calls people because they're not strong enough.

414
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,340
 They're not capable enough.

415
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,820
 They don't have the greatest influence.

416
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,020
 They've not got a great ministry.

417
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,780
 God raises up those that no one else in the world

418
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,980
 would look at because he looks upon them and he says,

419
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,580
 "Now this person can be used."

420
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,940
 See, so often in the call of God on our lives,

421
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,720
 God calls us to something that we are not able

422
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,680
 to accomplish in our own strength.

423
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,820
 He calls us to something where right now

424
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,840
 our current resources cannot achieve.

425
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,200
 He calls us, in other words, church, to faith.

426
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,540
 Because if you are adequate

427
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,000
 to live out the call of God in your life,

428
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,200
 then you don't need God for his call.

429
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,040
 And this is one of the first things

430
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,100
 that Moses has to grapple with.

431
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,860
 It's this idea that God is calling him and he is inadequate

432
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,580
 and that's part of the story.

433
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,740
 Because notice what God says next.

434
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,020
 God says this.

435
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,020
 He says, verse 12, God said, "I will be with you.

436
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,180
 "And this will be a sign to you

437
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,520
 "that it is I that has sent you.

438
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,280
 "When you have brought the people out of Egypt,

439
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,740
 "you," plural, all of you,

440
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,580
 "will worship God on this mountain."

441
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,740
 I love God's reply to Moses' cry of inadequacy.

442
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,860
 Who am I?

443
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,020
 God goes, "It doesn't matter who you are.

444
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,320
 "What matters is who I am.

445
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,920
 "And what matters is that I'm gonna be with you.

446
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,280
 "And if I've chosen to be with you,

447
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,700
 "who can be against you?"

448
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
 Some of you, that's a word in season in this room right now,

449
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,500
 watching online right now.

450
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,640
 You're not adequate, but that's okay

451
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,300
 'cause God is more than sufficient and God is with you.

452
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,420
 And when God is with us, who can be against us?

453
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,060
 And God says, "There'll be a sign to you

454
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,360
 "that I was with you,

455
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,860
 "a sign that you can take to the bank

456
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,920
 "that I journeyed with you.

457
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,280
 "And the sign is this.

458
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,780
 "When you gather around this mountain,

459
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,100
 "you will worship me."

460
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,180
 I love this idea.

461
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,020
 God is basically saying,

462
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,420
 "You wanna know what the fruit of Exodus is?

463
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,180
 "You wanna know what the fruit of freedom is?

464
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,900
 "It's worship.

465
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,860
 "When my people are set free,

466
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,000
 "they can't help but worship me."

467
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,300
 And he says, "This is a sign

468
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,420
 "that despite what might be happening in your life,

469
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,780
 "you will take it as truth,

470
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,800
 "as a joy, as a privilege to worship me,

471
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,300
 "that your circumstances will not define

472
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,480
 "whether you praise or not.

473
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,020
 "When I have delivered you, you will worship."

474
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,140
 There's a church in the center of Cairo

475
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,360
 that dates back to the fourth century.

476
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,880
 It's one of the oldest churches that there is in Egypt.

477
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,980
 And this church, despite an incredibly hostile environment

478
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,060
 since the fourth century,

479
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,720
 continues to gather to worship today.

480
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,060
 Because they have understood

481
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,180
 that what God has done through the Exodus

482
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,000
 has purchased a heavy price

483
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,260
 for them to have the freedom to declare the praises of God,

484
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,220
 even in a very strongly Islamic culture.

485
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,860
 And their ability to worship,

486
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,580
 I find incredibly inspiring and deeply challenging.

487
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,560
 And I want you to experience a little bit of that.

488
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,360
 I want you to feel a little bit of that today.

489
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,720
 And so I wanna take you to this particular church now.

490
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,080
 I wanna show you a little bit more of them.

491
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,040
 They're a very different church to us.

492
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,920
 They have icons and rituals.

493
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,320
 They're a Greek Orthodox church,

494
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,560
 very different to how we might worship here.

495
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,600
 And yet in their worship,

496
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,320
 we can see something that perhaps might help

497
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,160
 to facilitate ours.

498
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,400
 Let's go to Egypt.

499
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,400
 (wind blowing)

500
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:43,300
 We've come today to the busy, bustling center of Cairo City

501
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,300
 to actually explore perhaps what is the most central part

502
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,460
 of the Exodus story itself.

503
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,300
 Behind me right here is the Hanging Church of Cairo.

504
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,860
 It's a fourth century Coptic Orthodox church,

505
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,220
 making this perhaps the oldest worshiping community

506
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,940
 in Egypt today.

507
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,660
 This church truly has a remarkable story

508
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,460
 and I can't wait to show you around.

509
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,100
 The Hanging Church is named for its location

510
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,260
 above the gatehouse of an ancient Babylon fortress

511
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,500
 where its nave is actually suspended without trusts

512
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,420
 over the passage of the fortress,

513
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,700
 giving the structure the impression

514
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,820
 that it's hanging in the air.

515
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,940
 The church itself is approached by 29 steps,

516
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,900
 leading early travelers to Cairo

517
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,340
 to dub it the Staircase Church.

518
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,700
 The entrance from the street is through iron gates

519
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,860
 under a pointed stone arch.

520
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,100
 The 19th century facade with twin bell towers

521
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,580
 is then seen beyond a narrow courtyard

522
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,900
 decorated with modern biblical art.

523
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,080
 Up the steps and through the entrance is the main chapel,

524
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,580
 the entrance of which leads to an outer porch

525
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,340
 that dates back to the 11th century.

526
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,980
 But as beautiful as the structure of the church is,

527
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,640
 its real power rests in the stories that are found within it.

528
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,900
 One such story is found right here

529
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,140
 along the main wall of the church itself.

530
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,280
 This inscription here is in Arabic

531
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,500
 so that anybody walking here could read it.

532
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,540
 And it's actually a summary of that moment

533
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,020
 where Jesus meets the woman at the well

534
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,740
 and tells her that there is a water she could drink

535
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,660
 that will never run out.

536
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,060
 And here's the great thing.

537
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,020
 The church, right below that inscription,

538
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,620
 has created two taps.

539
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,220
 Now, they're boarded up here,

540
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,020
 but in centuries before, these two taps

541
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,380
 would provide sanitized running water

542
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,300
 to the poor people of Cairo.

543
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,260
 This was the church's social justice outreach.

544
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,660
 And the people would come here,

545
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,300
 they would take the clean, sanitized water,

546
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,980
 and at the same time read about a God

547
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,140
 who can provide water that would never run out.

548
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,980
 I mean, this is the gospel at work.

549
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,580
 This is the word and works side by side.

550
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:55,120
 One of the fascinating things about the Coptic church

551
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,740
 is their deep connection to Christianity's Jewish roots.

552
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
 In fact, a great example of that is found

553
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,500
 right here at the entrance to this particular church.

554
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,260
 I want you to see something really cool here.

555
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,120
 You'll notice that the Star of David

556
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,200
 is worked into the wood of the door

557
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,620
 right here at the entrance.

558
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,260
 And this has significant theological meaning.

559
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,620
 What the Coptics are saying is,

560
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,860
 before you even go inside the church to worship Jesus,

561
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,140
 you have to first enter through the doorway

562
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,500
 of the Old Testament.

563
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,320
 And when you think about us now understanding

564
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,920
 what Christ has done in liberating us

565
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,760
 out of the slavery of our sin

566
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,240
 and bringing us into the freedom of our promised land

567
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,880
 in grace and forgiveness,

568
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,160
 well, we only can really understand the beauty of that

569
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,880
 when we link it to the original Exodus story

570
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,520
 in the Old Testament itself.

571
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,360
 Like the Coptics, so also for us.

572
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,120
 We understand Jesus through the doorway

573
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,160
 of the Old Testament.

574
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,680
 The storytelling doesn't stop at the doorway.

575
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,140
 Right inside the main entrance

576
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,940
 is a beautiful, spacious courtyard

577
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,780
 leading to the steps that take worshippers

578
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,100
 to the main chapel.

579
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,340
 The courtyard is covered in modern biblical art

580
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,340
 telling stories of various Old Testament

581
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,620
 and New Testament events,

582
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,840
 specifically as they relate to Egypt.

583
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,620
 You know, just being here and being surrounded

584
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,780
 by all these mosaics and this beautiful iconography,

585
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,500
 I mean, you really get the sense

586
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,420
 of how important storytelling and remembering is

587
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,860
 to the Coptic practice of worship.

588
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,780
 And to find out a little bit more about that,

589
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,260
 I thought it would be great to sit down

590
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,540
 with one of the priests here,

591
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,660
 actually the priest that leads the morning prayers,

592
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,980
 and talk with them a little bit more

593
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,020
 about how central all of this beautiful art is

594
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,860
 to the way they practice their faith.

595
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:48,460
 Father Samuel, we're so grateful

596
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,900
 that you would host us in your beautiful church

597
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,700
 and show us a little bit about the Coptic worship.

598
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,900
 Maybe you could tell me a little bit

599
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,060
 about some of the icons that are here.

600
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,060
 Yes, it was a pleasure.

601
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,900
 Thank you.

602
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,740
 Thank you.

603
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,780
 This church is the name of the Virgin Mary

604
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,060
 and Saint Demian.

605
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,140
 It's called the Hanging Church.

606
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,580
 Why we call it the Hanging Church?

607
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,780
 Because it was built above the two fortress,

608
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,100
 Roman fortress.

609
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,140
 The ancient people put palm tree above the fortress

610
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,740
 and built the church above the fortress

611
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,660
 without any foundation.

612
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,700
 It used palm tree and the stones

613
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,380
 as a pavilion to this church.

614
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,660
 Because it's called the Hanging Church.

615
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,660
 As we see, the shape of the roof is made by wood

616
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:41,180
 because the heavy in the engineering style.

617
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,260
 Right, right, right, right.

618
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,380
 This church was built as a basilican style.

619
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,180
 It's famous for columns and arches.

620
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:57,700
 And as we see, it's built as Noah's Ark.

621
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
 As Noah's Ark?

622
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,540
 Yes.

623
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,460
 Oh, I didn't, I can see that with the way the wood,

624
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,300
 the roof is on the wall.

625
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,580
 Yes, and the windows.

626
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:12,180
 As we see, if you see the column,

627
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,340
 we can found eight columns.

628
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,180
 Okay.

629
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,180
 Which represent the eight persons who was in Noah's Ark.

630
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,500
 Noah, his wife, his three sons, and his wife.

631
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,340
 Yes.

632
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,180
 Yes.

633
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,020
 Oh, wow, okay.

634
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,340
 And why is Noah's Ark so important?

635
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,460
 Yes, because the Noah's Ark is symbol of salvation.

636
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,820
 And the church is a symbol of,

637
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,820
 is a salvation for people in the church.

638
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,300
 And I know for the Coptic church,

639
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,820
 the emphasis of salvation is very important.

640
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,660
 Yes.

641
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,420
 Are there other elements here that show us that?

642
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,460
 Yes.

643
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,140
 This icon says, symbol of the heaven.

644
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,860
 We can found Jesus Christ in the middle,

645
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,300
 and the Virgin Mary, and St. John's Baptism,

646
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,300
 and Archangel Gabriel, and Archangel Michael,

647
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,820
 and St. Peter, St. Paul.

648
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,660
 Wow.

649
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,500
 Yes.

650
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,740
 And I understand Paul is very central,

651
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,980
 and Peter is also very central to the Coptic church.

652
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,820
 Yes.

653
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
 Right, right, right, right.

654
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,180
 Okay, very interesting.

655
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,180
 This icon says, made of three items,

656
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,460
 ivory, ebony, and ebonos.

657
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,300
 Okay.

658
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,500
 Collected together without any glue, as a bezel.

659
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,420
 Oh, wow.

660
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,260
 Yes, we can see.

661
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,260
 And those three elements,

662
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,860
 do they represent like a trinity?

663
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,980
 Yes, yes.

664
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,860
 Okay, maybe show me again.

665
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,180
 As you see, this is ivory.

666
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,900
 This is ebony, and cedars.

667
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,740
 Oh, okay.

668
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,500
 Yes, it is collected together as a puzzle.

669
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,820
 Gathered together as a puzzle.

670
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,660
 As a puzzle?

671
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,500
 Yes.

672
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,820
 Oh, it moves.

673
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,380
 Oh, no way!

674
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,580
 We can see the ancient, this icon says,

675
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,700
 come back to the 11th century.

676
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,540
 Right.

677
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,900
 We can see the worker, how made the shape,

678
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,660
 is in ivory, without any machines,

679
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,140
 without any laser cut.

680
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,340
 Handmade.

681
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,740
 Yes, and the collected ivory was ebony

682
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,300
 with cedars together.

683
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,340
 Now, I know that there is a famous staircase here.

684
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,180
 Yeah.

685
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,060
 Can you explain to me the staircase?

686
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,740
 Maybe take me there and show me.

687
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,940
 Okay, yes, okay.

688
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,780
 We can found here, it's two doors.

689
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,620
 Oh, the doors.

690
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,940
 I didn't notice the doors before.

691
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,780
 Yes.

692
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,620
 Okay, okay.

693
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,260
 This is doors, when it's open,

694
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,180
 we found the two way to escape from this church.

695
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,580
 It's used in the ancient time.

696
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,420
 Okay.

697
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,820
 Because if anyone come to the church to kill people,

698
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,300
 you have two way.

699
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,820
 You have stay in the church to be a martyrs,

700
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,260
 like our martyrs here.

701
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,100
 Yes.

702
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,180
 Or to escape from this way,

703
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,940
 to go a new generation in Christianity.

704
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,100
 Of course, both is important.

705
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,940
 Yes.

706
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,860
 So people would actually, they would be worshipping here.

707
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,700
 Yes.

708
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,740
 Maybe if some danger comes in,

709
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,500
 the doors would open and they would go and escape that way.

710
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,340
 Yes.

711
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,180
 Wow.

712
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,100
 From here, you can see.

713
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,940
 Yeah.

714
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,740
 You can.

715
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,580
 Yeah.

716
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,340
 Amazing.

717
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,820
 Yes, we have two escape way.

718
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,220
 This is way to the people,

719
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,980
 and this escape way to a small room.

720
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
 Okay.

721
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,260
 Yes, from here.

722
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,420
 Oh, wow.

723
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,900
 From the stairs to a small room.

724
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,820
 If we didn't finish the service,

725
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,140
 the priest and one of the deacons

726
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:50,260
 take communion and go in this church

727
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:56,020
 and close the door and continue the liturgy,

728
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,860
 continue the service.

729
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,020
 Let me understand this,

730
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,820
 'cause I think this is very beautiful.

731
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,420
 So if people are having a service here,

732
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,980
 and somebody comes in in the old days,

733
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,980
 and it's dangerous, they would flee for their lives,

734
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,460
 but you would then go and still finish the service.

735
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,340
 Yes, yes.

736
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,820
 That's how important the worship is.

737
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,660
 Yes.

738
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,500
 To keep the worship going.

739
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,340
 Yes.

740
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,940
 Wow, that is a powerful story.

741
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,900
 Thank you so much.

742
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,500
 I mean, this for me is just so powerful

743
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,060
 to see the commitment to worship in Egypt

744
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,700
 for so many centuries.

745
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,740
 Yes, it's just an amazing thing.

746
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,860
 So why is all of this important?

747
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,860
 I mean, why have we come to this church today

748
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,780
 and understood its iconography and art

749
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,780
 and had examples of the worship here?

750
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,060
 Well, when God first appears to Moses

751
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,780
 at the burning bush in Exodus chapter three,

752
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,500
 he tells Moses the reason for the Exodus in the first place.

753
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,940
 He tells him why he's gonna send them back to Pharaoh

754
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,940
 to demand for the people to be let go

755
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,740
 and why he wants them to move from slavery to freedom.

756
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,420
 And it's for one simple reason,

757
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,660
 and that is to worship.

758
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,780
 God desires to deliver his people

759
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,900
 so they would be free to worship him.

760
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,220
 And that's why this church matters

761
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,420
 because all the people that gather here today

762
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,660
 in central Cairo are proof

763
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,740
 that the fruit of the Exodus is still ongoing.

764
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,100
 It's proof that people can still gather

765
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,180
 to be free to worship Jesus today.

766
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,020
 And that should be an encouragement to all of us.

767
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,900
 When you think about you and your freedom of worship,

768
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,300
 you should never take that freedom for granted.

769
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,340
 People have sacrificed and paid the price

770
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,020
 for thousands of years.

771
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,460
 And God is not just the God of the original Exodus.

772
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,740
 He is also the God of your Exodus too.

773
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,820
 And the challenge for you is to ask yourself this,

774
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,060
 are you truly free to worship?

775
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,620
 And are you doing it in your everyday life?

776
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,780
 Doing that will honor God

777
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,020
 and will honor the Exodus itself.

778
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,540
 (congregation applauding)

779
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:07,100
 This question of whether we're truly free to worship,

780
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,900
 I think is a question that is quite relevant

781
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,540
 for our church here in Hong Kong in this time.

782
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,380
 Perhaps it's a relevant question for us

783
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,980
 as we think about our future here in this city.

784
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,220
 And the story of the Hanging Church inspires me deeply

785
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,780
 'cause I want you to see the focus

786
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,420
 that they have at that church.

787
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,780
 Their focus is not on the political system

788
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,740
 and the political situation that they're in,

789
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,220
 although that's a very tricky situation in Egypt.

790
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,340
 Their focus isn't on the cultural realities

791
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,740
 of being a minority Christian community

792
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,940
 in a majority Islamic culture.

793
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,900
 Their focus is not even on whether somebody

794
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,700
 might come into that building with a bomb

795
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,300
 and try to kill people in their services.

796
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,480
 Their focus is on God and worshiping Him.

797
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,300
 So much so that if somebody does come in to bomb them,

798
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,260
 the priest will not flee with everybody,

799
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,180
 but will take some icon and some communion,

800
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,740
 will go down into that passageway and finish the service

801
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,700
 before he would look after his own life.

802
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,060
 I love it in the film where,

803
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,340
 when Father Samuel said that to me,

804
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,780
 I was like, kinda thought like he was sort of half joking.

805
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,820
 I'm like, "Really, really?"

806
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,460
 And he's like, "Yes, yes, of course."

807
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,020
 Almost like, "Would you not do that?"

808
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,980
 And I'm like, "No."

809
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,220
 I would run really fast and throw Vine people behind me.

810
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,020
 No, just kidding, I wouldn't do that.

811
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,100
 But what a deep challenge, isn't it?

812
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,980
 Like we worry, and maybe rightly so,

813
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,460
 what's our freedoms gonna be like in Hong Kong to worship?

814
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,980
 We are so free to worship.

815
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,820
 We do not have things on the bottom of our floors

816
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,700
 that we need to escape down if somebody comes in to kill us.

817
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,900
 Are you with me, church?

818
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,580
 And they are so focused on worship

819
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,500
 because they've come to understand the beauty of the Exodus

820
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,620
 that God sets us free so we can worship,

821
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,220
 sets us free so that we might be a sign

822
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,220
 to the world of that freedom.

823
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,340
 I mean, this church in the center of Cairo today,

824
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,060
 surrounded by all that it's surrounded by,

825
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,740
 is a sign that the Exodus actually happened.

826
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,700
 And I love how God says it here.

827
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,460
 He says, "This will be a sign to you.

828
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,780
 You will gather to worship."

829
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,380
 This is always what worship is.

830
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,980
 It is a sign to a tired and weary world that God is true,

831
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,300
 His promises are right, and He delivers His people.

832
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,700
 And I love how God says here,

833
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,100
 "It'll be a sign to you after you come out of Egypt."

834
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,340
 I love this because so often when God calls us to things,

835
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,940
 we wanna sign today.

836
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,940
 Give me a sign first, and then I'll do what you asked me to.

837
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,940
 Give me a sign, Lord.

838
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,380
 We're like, "Oh, I think God's calling this."

839
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,700
 God, just confirm it with a sign.

840
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,100
 And God says to Moses, "I'll give you a sign,

841
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,300
 but it will come at the end.

842
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,780
 I'll give you a sign after you've been obedient

843
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,700
 and trustful and faithful.

844
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,900
 And you will gather around this mountain

845
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,740
 and it'll be a sign.

846
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,580
 And from that point forward,

847
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,860
 it'll be a sign for all centuries and centuries

848
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,860
 and centuries of the power that there is

849
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,660
 for a God to deliver His people.

850
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,580
 The sign will come at the end to tell you

851
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,340
 that I was with you the whole way."

852
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,460
 The filming, I'm gonna finish with a story.

853
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,580
 I am finishing.

854
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,340
 I'm gonna finish with a story.

855
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,300
 The day that we filmed in the hanging church

856
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,140
 was day seven of 23 days of filming in Egypt.

857
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:25,060
 And it was quite easily the hardest day of filming for me.

858
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,140
 Not because it was technically difficult,

859
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,340
 but because of how I was feeling inside.

860
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,940
 We were six days in or seven days in,

861
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,820
 and I have to say it was such a battle

862
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,340
 to even get to Egypt.

863
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,620
 Four years of canceled visas,

864
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,940
 of not getting security clearances,

865
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,380
 of not knowing whether the company we were working with

866
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,100
 in Egypt was gonna come through for us.

867
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,660
 Four years of ups and downs.

868
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,900
 And every step of the way, pushing and pressing on

869
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,460
 and trying to do it and wondering, what are we doing?

870
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,900
 Is this really gonna happen for us or whatever?

871
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,980
 And then we finally get to Egypt and we start filming.

872
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,620
 And the filming is going relatively well,

873
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,260
 but self-doubt and insecurity is kind of really there for me.

874
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,460
 And I'm wrestling with this reality of,

875
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,460
 have I just tried to make this work in my own effort?

876
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,220
 Like, is God really in this?

877
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,460
 I mean, is this really gonna happen?

878
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,780
 Is this gonna go through?

879
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,340
 Like, is this gonna be a blessing

880
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,300
 to the church in Hong Kong?

881
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,140
 Is this actually gonna help anyone?

882
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,820
 And the day before we filmed at the hanging church,

883
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,660
 one of our crew members from the UK

884
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,820
 got a phone call from his wife.

885
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,260
 His wife was pregnant and she was supposed to give birth

886
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,100
 seven weeks after the end of filming.

887
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,340
 But she calls him and says, "My waters are just broken

888
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,860
 "and I'm heading to the hospital."

889
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,460
 So he, understandably, jumps on a plane that day

890
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,580
 and flies back to the UK and he manages to get there

891
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,420
 in time for the birth, amazing thing.

892
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,020
 But we were a person down on our shoot as well.

893
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,500
 And that was frustrating me as well.

894
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,180
 Like, oh God, why have we come all this way?

895
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,780
 And now like all this stuff is happening

896
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,980
 and why did that person come?

897
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,820
 God, what are you up to?

898
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,980
 How you even end this?

899
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,020
 Well, at the end of the filming with Father Samuel,

900
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,460
 I pretended like I was happy.

901
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,300
 (laughs)

902
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,740
 "Oh, Father Samuel, oh."

903
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,820
 He's such a nice guy, right?

904
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,980
 Like, it's like, how can you not like be nice around him?

905
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,940
 But inside I was like, ah, my attitude was really bad.

906
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,860
 And at the end of it, after we had finished filming,

907
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,460
 he said, "Andrew, I'd like you to come to my office.

908
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,180
 "I want to share Egyptian tea with you.

909
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,580
 "But you can't bring your cameras

910
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
 "'cause it's a sacred place."

911
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
 And I'm like, well, internally I was like,

912
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,700
 well, if I can't take my cameras,

913
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,940
 what's the point in going?

914
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,620
 (audience laughs)

915
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,860
 Are you with me, church?

916
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,740
 Don't be with me, don't be with me.

917
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,980
 (audience laughs)

918
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,620
 But I, and so I'm like having this bad attitude.

919
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,460
 I'm like, I'm not sure.

920
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,500
 And we had more filming to do in other places that day.

921
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,540
 So I was looking at my watch, looking at the schedule.

922
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,260
 And I remember like our Egyptian crew,

923
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,060
 one of the Egyptian guys that we had hired

924
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,380
 to help us with all the locations,

925
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,260
 he took me aside into a private place.

926
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,980
 It's just like, you know, when Jesus was bad

927
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,020
 and the disciples had to take Jesus to the side,

928
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,940
 you know, and so.

929
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,100
 So he takes me to the side and he goes,

930
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,260
 "Andrew, you need to understand

931
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,740
 "when an Egyptian priest invites you for a tea,

932
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,220
 "you do not say no, it's offensive if you say no."

933
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,660
 So I'm like, are you telling me I have to do this?

934
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,300
 He's like, "You have to do this."

935
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,340
 So I'm like, okay, come on, let's go.

936
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,740
 Okay, I don't even like Egyptian tea, but that's fine.

937
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,260
 (audience laughs)

938
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,540
 I'll go.

939
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,420
 So myself on my own, no cameras, no nothing.

940
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,700
 We go into his room and we sit down.

941
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,940
 And Father Sam was such a nice guy.

942
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,020
 He sits me down in a chair next to his desk.

943
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,700
 He's got this big, massive, ornate desk.

944
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,540
 I sit down, there's a Bible opened on his desk.

945
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,300
 There's a Bible opened on my desk, by the way,

946
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,620
 most of the time.

947
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,780
 There's a big Bible opened on his desk.

948
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,220
 And on top of the Bible is an icon, one of the icons.

949
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,500
 It's a wooden cross.

950
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,380
 And immediately my eyes are drawn to this cross.

951
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,220
 And I'm trying to think,

952
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,740
 what am I gonna talk about with Father Samuel?

953
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,300
 So I'm like, oh, nice cross.

954
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,220
 Can I have a look at the cross?

955
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,100
 So Father Samuel takes the cross off his Bible.

956
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,540
 He passes it over to me and I look at it.

957
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,140
 Now, it's a cross where there are two images on both sides.

958
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,340
 On one image, on one side, it's the ascension of Jesus,

959
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,860
 Jesus floating up into heaven.

960
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,420
 On the other side, it's Jesus on the cross,

961
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,620
 bleeding on the cross.

962
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,660
 It was quite gruesome.

963
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,860
 It was kind of one of these icons

964
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,740
 where you can turn it like this.

965
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,180
 But what struck me as soon as I saw it

966
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,940
 was that on the cross at the top and the bottom

967
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,860
 were massive pieces of grapes, pitches of grapes,

968
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,860
 and a little vine that was connected to the grapes.

969
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,340
 And I looked at this cross and I said to him,

970
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,180
 what does this mean?

971
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,020
 What is this cross?

972
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,060
 What does it mean?

973
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,340
 And he said, oh, this was made by the nuns in our nunnery,

974
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,460
 just by the side of the church.

975
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,180
 And this is the cross that says,

976
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,460
 I am the vine and you are the branches.

977
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,980
 And I started to like well up with tears.

978
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,060
 'Cause I mean, this guy didn't know all of the emotions

979
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,780
 that were going around in my heart that day.

980
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,180
 But God knew.

981
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,420
 And God had provided a sign.

982
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,700
 Not at the start, not even in the middle,

983
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,060
 not even at the beginning of year four.

984
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,900
 But when I had finally gone to Egypt,

985
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,220
 we'd finally started recording and there it was,

986
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,060
 I was with you the whole time.

987
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,460
 And that just released worship.

988
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,100
 It just released gratitude and thankfulness

989
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,460
 that my God was with me the whole time,

990
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,780
 even though so often I felt like he was distant.

991
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,260
 And I was literally like welling up with tears.

992
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,460
 And I think Father Samuel thought

993
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,460
 that maybe the icon was having an effect on me or something.

994
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,580
 And he said, would you like to keep it?

995
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,820
 And so this is now one of my favorite possessions.

996
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,980
 Here it is, this is it.

997
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,540
 You can see it up here, you can see a big picture of it.

998
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,700
 Look at that, there's that side

999
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,340
 and then there's the not so nice side

1000
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,020
 where he's bleeding and stuff.

1001
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,020
 But can you see the grapes, top, top and bottom?

1002
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,140
 You can have a look at this afterwards

1003
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,500
 if you'd like to look at this.

1004
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,380
 It's one of my, honestly, one of my great,

1005
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,980
 I'm gonna place it on my Bible, one of my great treasures.

1006
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,620
 (audience laughing)

1007
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,940
 It released me to worship.

1008
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,460
 And I want you to know that God has a call on your life

1009
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,180
 that you're not adequate for.

1010
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,460
 And if you're part of the church here in Hong Kong right now,

1011
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,420
 there's an important call on your life.

1012
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,260
 And that is to be someone who can testify

1013
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,500
 and be a sign to the world that God's promises are true,

1014
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,540
 that he can bring freedom,

1015
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,460
 and that he can truly set us free by his grace.

1016
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,940
 And as we sing, as we go about our workplace,

1017
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,680
 as we meet God in various areas of our lives,

1018
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,680
 may we constantly be a symbol of the freedom of God.

1019
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,620
 Amen.

1020
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,660
 I wonder whether you'd astound me, I wanna pray for us,

1021
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,560
 and I wanna release us into a moment of worship together.

1022
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,020
 I invite you just to open your hands.

1023
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,140
 Lord, we come before you now,

1024
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,120
 grateful for the example of the Hanging Church in Cairo,

1025
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,740
 for Father Samuel and the other priests,

1026
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,900
 for the worshipers in that community there.

1027
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,700
 Father, as we're here in Hong Kong

1028
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,860
 and we have some questions

1029
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,900
 about our religious freedoms in our city,

1030
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,700
 and as those questions perhaps are over us at this time,

1031
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,820
 and we're wondering what the future might hold,

1032
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,860
 Father, thank you for this reminder

1033
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,620
 that our focus isn't on those things.

1034
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,260
 Our focus is on you,

1035
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,940
 and of the incredible privilege we have right now

1036
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,580
 to worship you, to be free to gather in this room,

1037
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,160
 to open our hearts and to declare with our voices,

1038
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,220
 to be a sign in our city that your promises are true.

1039
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,460
 Father, I pray for anyone in this room

1040
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,240
 that feels inadequate for the call of God on their lives.

1041
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,180
 I pray that, Lord, you would fill them today

1042
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,780
 with your spirit again and tell them I am with you,

1043
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,060
 that I am sufficient for your inadequacy.

1044
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,000
 Lord, I pray that you would release worship in this place

1045
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,500
 as we recognize that our freedom from sin

1046
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,980
 releases us to a place of gratitude,

1047
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,980
 to a place of offering our hearts to you

1048
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,140
 and our worship to you.

1049
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,780
 And Lord, as we worship you now, come Holy Spirit.

1050
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,260
 On Pentecost Sunday, they gathered in that room,

1051
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,060
 your spirit fell, and they worshipped you.

1052
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,600
 They worshipped you in multiple tongues and languages

1053
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,320
 so that everybody who didn't know you in their city

1054
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,520
 could come to know Jesus.

1055
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,620
 That was a sign of the power of the freedom of worship

1056
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,580
 led by the spirit.

1057
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,140
 And Lord, as we worship you now,

1058
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,380
 would you move in the spirit,

1059
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,180
 and with all the cultures that are represented in this room,

1060
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,980
 may we be your hands and feet

1061
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,020
 to a tired and weary Hong Kong.

1062
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,220
 Can we bring the hope of the gospel in this time.

1063
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,020
 We pray this in Jesus' name.
