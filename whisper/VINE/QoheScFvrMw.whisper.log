[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   Such good time to worship together, isn't it? It really does feed our soul.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.800]   Well, it is a privilege to continue the service and to continue in this sermon series
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.400]   that we've been having around our hearts and to be able to invite
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.400]   one of our founding pastors, John Snellgrove, to close this series.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.400]   Are you doing well?
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400]   I'm good.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.200]   He's like shining. You're shining. You're glowing.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.400]   Have you just met with God?
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   I can tell.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.400]   Yay! Well, Father, we thank you.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.200]   We thank you for this man. We thank you for the heritage that he brings.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.200]   We thank you for his passion, but more than that, for his simple love of you, Jesus.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.600]   And so, Father, as he shares from his heart, I pray our hearts will be open, not closed,
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.600]   but open our hearts to really hear and receive through John today. In Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.200]   Amen. Thank you. Carla's here for Carla.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.400]   Good. Good morning, everybody.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.400]   That gentleman over there is coming home. I'm just telling you. He's coming home.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.600]   Good. If you see me with one of these in my hands, beware.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.400]   Now, most of you know me as the friendly guy with a smile.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.200]   You know, always ready to give you a hug.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.000]   Even if you don't really want a hug, you inevitably end up getting a hug.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.600]   But give me a tennis racket. Put me on a tennis court.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.200]   You will see a very different person.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:02.600]   And the issue is, I have a competitive nature.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600]   Now, don't just believe me.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.200]   I collected some comments from my Thursday night tennis colleagues at the Hong Kong Gulf Coast
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.800]   and a couple of fellow Viners who get to see the other side of me on the other side of the net, so to speak.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.000]   I invite you. I've put them on the screen.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.200]   I invite you to take some time to have a look at them.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   It's shocking.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.800]   John exudes those great Christian values of compassion, caring, forgiveness, and tolerance.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   And all he does, except between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. every Thursday during social tennis.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   A one-line observation from your partner on court.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.200]   People expect John to be forgiving of all my mistakes on court,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.400]   but sometimes he can be a little unforgiving.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.000]   Is that a bad thing? He likes to win. That's clear.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.600]   Someone said, "First time I got to know John on a tennis court, competitiveness was all around John.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.800]   I could smell it in the air that night."
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.400]   Another guy said, "John is so happy to let you know as his teammate if you're not on your game.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.800]   He's like a little volcano with small verbal eruptions."
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.400]   And my favorite, "Intense sport competition is typically associated with young people,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.800]   so that's the mindset of many.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.000]   If you see John on the tennis court, you will change your mind."
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Now, this is totally shocking, I admit. Totally shocking.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.200]   But where did this come from?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.800]   Now, you have to go a long way back with me.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:07.400]   With my sisters being 18 and 20 years older than me, I was an effective only child.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.800]   Now, the advantage of our public housing apartment in Southeast London that I lived in from age 10
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.000]   is that it was on the ground floor.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.400]   And 54 Comer's house was right next to a little playground.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   Now, you won't believe this, but the outside wall of our apartment had two colors of bricks.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.800]   And the darker ones were remarkably approximately the height of a tennis net.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.400]   The playground became a young boy's tennis court.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.600]   And so I would play regularly.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.400]   But how does an effective only child do that?
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.000]   I tell you, I would play left hand against right hand.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.400]   The only problem was that no hand wanted to lose.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.200]   So points would invariably go on for a very long time.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.800]   A word of warning, I can still play pretty well left-handed these days.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   And that sort of summed up my life.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.200]   It was always the family joke that with my sisters being,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:37.600]   my younger sister being 18 years older than me, I was dubbed "the mistake."
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:48.000]   In the too much information pile, even the place and the circumstances of my conception were in there,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.400]   which I'll thankfully spare you this morning.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:05.000]   But I guess, looking back, I've spent so much of my life, to be honest, trying to live this down.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   At school, I wanted to be top of the class.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And I was.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.200]   In business, I wanted to be top dog.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   And to a large extent, I was.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:27.600]   And to be honest, this attitude began to creep into my Christian life and my church life.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:39.800]   Until one day, I realized that I was God's favorite son.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   We all are.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.600]   And I was definitely not a mistake.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   Psalm 139 tells us this, "For you created my inmost being.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   You knit me together in my mother's womb.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made."
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.400]   Fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   And I'm so grateful for this opportunity to share from the heart,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   on the back of the excellent "Different Spirit" series.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:30.000]   Now going back to last month, if you can remember last month, remember the 12 spies were divided.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.400]   Moses had sent 12 spies out to search the promised land.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:42.000]   But 10 of them, they only saw the giants in the land and they got cold feet.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.800]   Joshua and Caleb saw the opportunity and had the belief to take the land.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.400]   They had a different spirit.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   Now my heart for you today is simple.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   The major constituent of community is unity.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:16.800]   Those of you who are math experts will know it's 55.55 recurring percent.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:26.000]   But what we see in our churches, in our society, and in our nations,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:35.400]   is more about competition than cooperation.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:41.400]   I believe that competition is the spirit of this age.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.600]   And I'm here today to call it out.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.800]   The world is promoting its mantra,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.400]   "The competitive spirit is the answer to all your problems."
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.800]   I recently read an article which said this,
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.000]   "The competitive spirit is the atom of self-improvement.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.400]   It is the basic unit of life for an individual who wants it all,
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.800]   and is willing to work to get it all."
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.400]   Now don't get me wrong, competition is not all bad.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.800]   Positive competition occurs when we compete healthily,
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:30.600]   in a way that brings the best in us, and the best in everyone involved.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:39.200]   But can I just say, competitive relationships are toxic and draining.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:47.000]   People need and are desperate for honesty, support, and tolerance.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And competition provides none of these.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:03.600]   As a pastor, it really breaks my heart to see the competitive spirit
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:13.200]   destroying marriages, families, friendships, and even churches.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.000]   I have found that competing with and comparing yourselves to others
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.400]   is not about what's happening inside of you.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   Sorry, I said it again.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.800]   It's not about what's happening outside of you.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:33.600]   It's about what is going on in the deepest recesses of your heart.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.800]   And Vine Church, today, I want to call this out.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.600]   And when we open our Bible, we find many stories,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.600]   examples of those with competitive spirits.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.000]   We don't have to look very far.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.200]   Right at the beginning, in the first four chapters of Genesis,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.800]   we see the story of Cain and Abel and their jealousy.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   Think about it for a moment.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:15.000]   Isn't it ironical that the first murder in history was actually a brother killing another brother?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.800]   Let's look at the background.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.000]   Sometime after Adam and Eve had sinned against God
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and were forced out of the Garden of Eden, they began to have children.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.400]   The first son was Cain, and he was a farmer.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   The second son was Abel, he was a shepherd.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   And when it was time to offer sacrifices to God,
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:45.600]   Cain brought what was described as "some fruit" from the ground,
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:54.200]   and Abel brought what was described as "fat portions" from some of the firstborn.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.000]   Now, God favoured Abel's sacrifice,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   and he didn't extend that same grace to Cain.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.200]   Abel had brought first fruits.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.400]   Cain had brought the leftovers.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.800]   Now, this rejection made Cain angry.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   He was raging with jealousy.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.400]   God graciously gave Cain a route back, a way out.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.600]   But his competitive spirit led to tragedy.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.600]   We read in Genesis 4, 8, "And Cain said to Abel his brother,
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.800]   'Let's go out into the field.'
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:44.600]   And when they were in the field, Cain rose against Abel his brother, and he killed him."
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.200]   And so what we see firstly is that jealousy,
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.800]   jealousy is a gateway to a competitive spirit.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:00.200]   Being jealous indicates that we're not satisfied with what God's given us.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.800]   The Bible tells us in Hebrews 13, 5, to be content with what we have,
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.200]   "For God will never fail us or forsake us."
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:17.000]   In order to combat jealousy, we need to become more like Jesus,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.600]   and less like ourselves.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.200]   So that's jealousy. And then we see favoritism.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.400]   We see this in the story of Joseph and his brothers.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.000]   Jacob's favoritism is well known.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.400]   We know about the multi-colored coat, don't we?
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.600]   But it made his brothers so jealous that in Genesis 37,
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.800]   they too were ready to murder him.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.400]   Instead, they only, only, sold him into slavery,
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   telling the father that he had been torn into pieces by a wild beast.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.600]   Now this caused the patriarch no end of grief.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.800]   This time the story has a happy ending.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.800]   But what we can clearly see is this,
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   favoritism is a path to the competitive spirit.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:20.400]   If jealousy is a pathway, favoritism is also a pathway to a competitive spirit.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.800]   And I felt led this morning to challenge us.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.600]   I want to challenge you about your workplace.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:35.000]   Do you show favoritism towards a certain type of colleague over another?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.800]   A certain race? A certain skill set?
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   What about in your social life?
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:49.200]   Are you showing favoritism in terms of who you hang out with?
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:58.000]   The Bible is clear that favoritism is not God's will for our lives.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:11.600]   I believe that favoritism is a pathway to a competitive spirit.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:19.000]   Favoritism is inconsistent with God's character.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.800]   The Bible says God does not show favoritism, Romans 2.11.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.600]   All are equal before him.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:32.400]   Ephesians 6.9 says there is no favoritism with him.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:39.200]   And favoritism is still a problem we deal with today.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.400]   Favoritism and partiality are not from God.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.800]   And Christians, as Christians we are called to love.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:56.200]   As humans we tend to form judgments based on selfish personal criteria
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   rather than seeing others as God sees them.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.800]   Secondly, the Bible teaches us that Christians are not to show favoritism.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:16.000]   James 2.1 says, "My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism."
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:25.800]   And thirdly, and possibly more importantly, the Bible calls favoritism sin.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:34.200]   Favoritism is a serious offense against God's call to love our neighbor as ourselves.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.400]   Now let me be clear, there is nothing wrong with preferences,
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:46.000]   which we all have and are part of our likes and dislikes in our personality.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.600]   The challenge is to avoid favoritism, which the Bible calls a sin.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.800]   And so we move on to pride.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.200]   And I want to look at the story of Pharaoh and Moses.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:13.600]   This is the picture, the Israelites were in captivity and God chose Moses to lead them out towards freedom.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:20.400]   Moses told Pharaoh, "Let my people go, so that they might have a feast to me in the wilderness."
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.200]   He was speaking on behalf of God.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.200]   But Pharaoh was on the throne.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.600]   He would not let the God of those slaves give him orders.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:43.000]   And Pharaoh arrogantly replied, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.800]   I do not know the Lord, nor will I let Israel go."
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.200]   And what we saw, didn't we? Devastating plagues.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.400]   Through them, the Lord broke Pharaoh's stubborn pride.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   But only after terrible misery and loss.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:16.600]   Pharaoh and his people paid a very high price before he finally acknowledged the Lord's right to rule.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:26.200]   Pride is a sin because of its self-centered rather than God-centered perspective on life.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:34.400]   In fact, pride is a pathway to competitive spirit.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.200]   Now pride can also mean conceit, arrogance, superiority.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   This kind of pride is based on self-centeredness and it is destructive.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.400]   Selfish pride is especially destructive to relationships.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:19:00.200]   Because the opposite of loving others is actually not hating them.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:06.000]   The opposite of loving others is being self-centered.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.600]   Now what we want to make clear is that pride is essentially competitive.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.800]   It is competitive by its very nature.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:20.400]   Whilst the other vices are competitive only, as it were, by accident.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:29.200]   Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only having more of it than the other man.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:36.000]   We see people being proud of being richer, cleverer, better looking than others.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.600]   Think about it for a moment.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:45.600]   If everyone were equally rich, clever, good-looking, that would make nothing to be proud about.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:55.000]   It is the comparison that makes you proud and the pleasure of being above the rest.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.400]   Even the disciples suffered from competition.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   You're not going to believe this.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.200]   I mean, Jesus was about to go to the cross.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.400]   He just celebrated the Last Supper.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.600]   The first thing we read after this time...
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.400]   I mean, the Last Supper is so holy that we still celebrate it today, right?
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.800]   And the first thing we read is quite frankly unbelievable.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.000]   I've put it on the screen.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.800]   Okay, they've just enjoyed the supper.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.600]   They know Jesus is going to the cross.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:38.400]   Now there was also a dispute amongst them as to which of them should be considered the greatest.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:46.200]   Now, if this was today, someone would probably have organized a reality TV show
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.800]   with one-by-one eliminations.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.200]   But Jesus had it covered.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:57.000]   He said, "If you want to be the greatest, you be a servant."
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.200]   And it wasn't just the disciples who were competitive.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:08.400]   Look at the mother of James and John, the original tiger mom.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:14.000]   This is the story of a mom who only wanted the best for her sons.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.600]   Because she loved them, she was proud of them, and because she had great dreams of them...
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.800]   You've heard this probably already.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:27.400]   She came to Jesus one day with an audacious request.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   She asked that when Jesus comes into his kingdom, he would have one boy sit on the right hand,
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.400]   and the other sit on the left.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:41.600]   She wanted her sons to have the highest places of honor, at the top table, so to speak.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.200]   No small dreams here.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:51.600]   She had big dreams, and her sons had large ambitions.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:22:00.800]   But what we see here is that selfish ambition is a pathway to a competitive spirit.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:08.600]   But the Bible tells us in Philippians 2, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit,
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:15.200]   but in humility consider others better than yourself."
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.800]   Now, look, I must put this into context, so you don't misunderstand me.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   There is a big difference between ambition and selfish ambition.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:37.600]   Ambition of itself is not wrong, but when it is focused on me, me, me, it is destructive.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.400]   What we are talking about here is a competitive spirit.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.200]   Whilst the Bible does not forbid competition,
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:55.800]   it does forbid the heart attitudes that so many have when they do compete.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:00.600]   The Scripture is clear that we are to do all things for God's glory.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:10.000]   1 Corinthians 10 says this, "Whatever you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God."
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Now, all must include competitions, including my tennis.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.400]   Eric Liddell, before serving as a missionary in China, ran in the 1924 Summer Olympics.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.600]   You may remember him from the film, Chariots of Fire.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.400]   In the film, we see him spurning his favorite event,
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:43.600]   100 meters, it was actually 100 yards in those days, he spurred it in favor of the less favored 400 meters,
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:51.600]   because the 100 meters final was on a Sunday, contravening his Christian convictions.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.000]   And he, of course, won the gold in the 400 meters.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.400]   Liddell demonstrated the kind of attitude that one should have when competing.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.800]   He said this, "I believe that God made me for a purpose."
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.600]   Yeah, he was going to serve in China.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   "But he also made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure."
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:25.000]   As I look at the 21st century, especially in a place like Hong Kong,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   where the boys with the most toys win the match, have the biggest and best job,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   apartment, car, looks, physique, even churches.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   When I go to a pastor's conference, do you know the question they always ask me?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   "How many people at your church?"
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.600]   Every time, guaranteed. And do you know what answer I give?
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.400]   "I don't know."
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.000]   They say, "Why don't you know?"
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.400]   I said, "If you're asking me how many bums are on a seat between 11 and about quarter to one,
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.000]   I can give you that number.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.400]   But that's not church."
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:24.200]   I think we can have an amen to that.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.000]   Because it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.600]   There is an urgency to redefine this thing we call church,
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.800]   that many put down to an hour and a half on a Sunday morning.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.400]   At The Vine, we've had a call to community.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.600]   We've had community groups. We've had river communities.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:55.200]   How does this manifest a different spirit?
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   I believe this, and this is one of those you might want to screenshot,
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.400]   because this is worth having, I tell you.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.400]   So just get your phones out.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.200]   I believe the definition of community is this,
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   "Community equals cooperation, less competition."
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.600]   Do you like that one? I'll say it again.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:20.800]   "Community equals cooperation, less competition."
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:29.000]   Another word for cooperation is collaboration.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.600]   Collaboration.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.600]   What does it mean to collaborate?
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:39.800]   Well, I tell you this, collaboration has no room for jealousy.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.000]   Collaboration has no room for favoritism.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Collaboration has no room for pride.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And collaboration has no room for selfish ambition.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.800]   Now, what do I mean by this?
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   Let's look at the early church.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.400]   It was the day of Pentecost.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   The Holy Spirit came.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.000]   By the way, amazing sense of the Holy Spirit's presence during our worship today.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.400]   The Holy Spirit came.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.800]   Peter preached.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:17.600]   As a result, we read 3,000 people were saved.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.800]   Again, if this was the 21st century,
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.400]   we'd be tempted to say, "Let's organize another rally.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.200]   Maybe we'll get 5,000.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.800]   Maybe we'll get 10,000.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.400]   The sky's the limit.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.800]   This guy Peter would make a great stadium evangelist.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.200]   Put him on social media.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.600]   He'll be a sensation.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.200]   I even gave him a hashtag, #PetePreach.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:50.000]   There we are.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.600]   But look at how the disciples responded.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.400]   They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship,
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.800]   the breaking of bread, and to prayer.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:10.000]   Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.600]   All the believers were together and had everything in common.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:20.600]   They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:26.000]   Every day, they continued to meet together in the temple courts.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.400]   They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.600]   praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:44.200]   And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.400]   My goodness, don't you want to be part of a church like that?
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:54.400]   Now, we all know that the church in the New Testament was not perfect.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.800]   It was not exempt.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.600]   It suffered from the competitive spirit.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:06.000]   You'll say to me, "Pastor John, I think of Peter's struggle in showing favoritism to the Jews over the Gentiles."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.600]   The jealousy and discord between Paul and Silas.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:17.400]   The pride of the church in Corinth had with some members taking communion before others.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.800]   The disciples were human after all.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:30.200]   But when I read this verse, verse 44, "All the believers were together and had everything in common,"
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:37.600]   I see that jealousy, favoritism, pride, selfish ambition took second place
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:43.400]   as competition was shaded by collaboration.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:55.400]   In a Peanuts cartoon, Lucy demanded that Linus change the TV channel,
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:00.200]   threatening him with her fist if he didn't.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:06.200]   Linus said this, "What makes you think you can walk right in here and take over?"
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:16.600]   Lucy said, "These five fingers. Individually, they're nothing.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   But when I call them together like this into a single unit,
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.600]   they form a weapon that is terrible to behold."
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:36.600]   Linus said, "Which channel do you want?"
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   Turning away, he looks at his own fingers and says, "Why can't you guys get organized like that?"
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.600]   Now, can I be honest? The purpose of my talk,
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   the Vine Church, the Church of Hong Kong has no chance,
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:31:01.600]   no chance in fulfilling its God-given purpose if we embrace competition rather than collaboration.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:07.600]   We need a different spirit and a new heart.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   I've been comparing the church, the early church in Jerusalem in 1830,
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.200]   and the one that I observe in Hong Kong and elsewhere in 2021.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:22.800]   And the question I've been asking myself is, "Why are they so different?"
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   I see the believers, the early believers, sharing their possessions, giving to those in need.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.400]   I see numbers added daily.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:40.800]   I see miracles happening to such an extent that people wanted to get under Peter's shadow so they could be healed.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.000]   Have you ever wondered why we are so different?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   I'll tell you why.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.800]   Competition has overshadowed collaboration.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.000]   Let me say it again.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.400]   Competition has overshadowed collaboration.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:08.800]   And what I want to do, I want to pick out three words or phrases from this passage in Acts 2 that I read earlier.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.200]   Firstly, number one, they devoted themselves.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.600]   Number two, all the believers were together.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.000]   And thirdly, they continued to meet together.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.600]   Devoted, together, continued.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.400]   Firstly, they devoted themselves.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.600]   I've put the Greek word up there. It's a rather long one.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.600]   It's proskatorunetes.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:39.200]   I'll have it right by four o'clock.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:48.200]   Its meaning is to continue steadfastly in a thing and give unremitting care to it.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.800]   To persevere, to be in constant readiness.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.000]   I actually like the choice of the English word here, devotion.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.600]   I love that word, devotion, which means love, loyalty, enthusiasm for a person or an activity.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   It describes the level of passion and determination the disciples had in their desire for community,
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:18.000]   their desire for collaboration.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.200]   The second thing we look at is all the believers were together.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.200]   That's quite interesting.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:31.400]   In Acts 2, verse 1, we read, "When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place."
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.600]   I guess we always think of the upper room as the one place.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:46.400]   But the Greek word for one place, homothumadon, is actually translated in other versions as "with one accord."
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.000]   So interesting.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:56.600]   They were in the same place physically, but they were also in the same place spiritually.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.000]   Now what does that mean?
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.800]   It means being unanimous, having mutual consent, being in agreement, having group unity,
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:10.600]   having one mind, passion, and purpose of collaboration, not competition.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:21.400]   Returning to my key verse, verse 44, "All the believers were together and had everything in common."
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:32.800]   Notice the similarity between this verse and the "all together in one place" that I described on the day of Pentecost.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.600]   And lastly, they continued to meet together.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.200]   They met frequently.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.000]   They associated together.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.600]   They hung out together, and in doing so, expressed their mutual love.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.800]   I love the way the writer of the Hebrews expresses it in Hebrews 10, 25.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:35:01.400]   "Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another."
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:09.400]   And we read, "They held all things in common."
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.800]   So mighty was their love of God shared in their heart.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.400]   So mighty was their love for each other.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:24.600]   So unified their family that they did not look at their material possessions as their own.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.400]   There was a genuine need in the fellowship.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:34.000]   They would sell personal property and distribute the proceeds.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.200]   And it leads me again to ask, is that where the Vine family is?
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:42.600]   Is that where the Church of Hong Kong in 2021 is?
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:55.400]   We are so much better as a church, as a city, when we're pulling together.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:01.600]   Collaboration must become our theme tune.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.400]   Let me share an illustration.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.200]   At a county fair in a horse pulling contest,
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:14.800]   the winning horse pulled 4,500 pounds.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   The runner-up pulled 4,000 pounds.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   Then the two horses teamed together and they pulled 12,000 pounds.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:43.200]   That's 3,500 pounds more than they were able to pull individually.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.400]   If we could apply that to the church,
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:57.400]   we will see there is no limit to the power of collaboration in God's work.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:06.600]   As I bring this series to a close, can I share my dream?
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.200]   After all, the Bible says old men dream dreams, right?
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.800]   So I'm going to share my dream.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:19.400]   I dream of collaborative Christians.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:25.200]   I see a church where the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.400]   People of different ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:36.200]   pulling together to achieve great things for the kingdom of God.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.800]   I dream of collaborative churches.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.200]   I see churches of different sizes, languages, denominations,
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.400]   working together with a kingdom mindset
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:56.600]   that means one church is not just a catchphrase or a hashtag.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   I'm often asked, "How many churches are there in Hong Kong, Pastor?"
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.000]   I say, "One."
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:12.600]   Possibly the boldest part of my dream is for collaborative countries.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.800]   We're in such a divided world.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.200]   I don't know how you feel when you read the newspaper headlines in the morning.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   It's depressing.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.200]   But I see barriers between nations and people groups coming down,
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:34.600]   particularly as collaborative Christians and collaborative churches
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   respond to the outworking of the Great Commission.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.200]   But where does it start?
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   It starts with you.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.800]   And you.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.400]   And you.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.600]   And you.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.200]   And me.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   I'm going to invite you to stand.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:07.000]   And I'm going to invite you to step out of your comfort zone for a minute.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.800]   What I'm going to invite you to do is actually in this time
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:19.600]   go and find somebody in the church who is not your husband, wife, your son, your daughter, your friend.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:24.400]   Go and find someone you don't know.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.200]   And just go see them.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.800]   Now, you might be an arm bump person.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.200]   You might be a huggy like me.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.000]   It's COVID, right?
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.200]   So we're respecting the rules, right?
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.000]   So do what you think is good.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.400]   You might want to just introduce yourself.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.400]   You might want to say who you are.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.800]   You might want to exchange WhatsApps.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.200]   This is not a dating time, by the way.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.600]   I'm just telling you.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:51.200]   This is not John's dating.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   Not a bad idea, but it's not what it's designed for.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.600]   And you might even want to pray for each other.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   This is symbolic.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.600]   It's symbolic of what God is calling us to do.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.800]   But actually, it's more than that.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.200]   It's real.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:17.000]   You know, sometimes you come to church and you don't know anyone other than the people who are sitting either side of you.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.800]   Maybe you don't even know the person next to you.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   So I want you to spend that time just getting to know someone.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.000]   And I'll leave it to you.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.800]   You might just want to talk or pray to God.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.400]   And then what we're going to do at the end, we're going to come back together.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.200]   And together, we're going to pray for our city.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   I'd love to do that.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.800]   So could you do that?
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   Is that okay?
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   Not too much to ask.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.000]   Good.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Excellent.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   So please do that.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   [Praying]
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.400]   [Praying]
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:06.600]   [Praying]
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   [Praying]
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   [Praying]
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   [Praying]
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   [Praying]
