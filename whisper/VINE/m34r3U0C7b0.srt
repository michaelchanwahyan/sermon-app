1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Thank you, worship team, and (speaks in foreign language)

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,960
 God's blessings be with you,

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,840
 and may you be filled with the energy

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,600
 of horses and dragons, something like that, right?

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,840
 Anyway, it's happy new year,

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,540
 and I'm glad to see it's an honor to be here this morning.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,480
 We're gonna be in Colossians chapter three,

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,640
 so if you have a Bible,

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,000
 if you wanna turn your attention to the screen,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
 Colossians chapter three is where

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,240
 we'll be talking about today.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
 I'm gonna read it first,

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,960
 and then we're gonna carry on with the message.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,000
 It says this, this is the word of the Lord.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
 "Therefore, as God's chosen people,

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,940
 "holy and dearly loved,

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,640
 "clothe yourselves with compassion,

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,720
 "kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,960
 "Bear with each other and forgive one another

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,640
 "if you have any grievance against someone.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,120
 "Forgive as the Lord forgave you,

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,680
 "and over all these virtues, put on love,

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,400
 "which binds them all together in perfect unity.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,440
 "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,380
 "since as members of one body,

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,560
 "you are called to peace, and be thankful."

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,680
 So it is new year,

28
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,080
 and if you've been celebrating Chinese New Year,

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,680
 it's probably been quite a busy time in the past few days,

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,520
 and the next few days coming up, right?

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,600
 Lots of visiting families, visiting friends,

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,480
 all that kind of stuff.

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,780
 Certain things just have to be done, right?

34
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,500
 You maybe had to do a good spring cleaning of your house,

35
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,760
 lots of dinners.

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,000
 We had our family over last night for dinner,

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,080
 and great, we had some hot pots,

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,600
 but it isn't Chinese New Year

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,620
 until your mom starts singing karaoke really badly.

40
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,880
 Actually, my mom's a decent singer,

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,400
 but she was singing William Fong,

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,480
 and then I turned up the volume.

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,640
 What was she singing?

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,680
 ♪ Da da da dee dee new fong ♪

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,960
 ♪ Da da da da da da ♪

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,320
 You know, all those kind of old Cantonese pop songs

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,840
 that she likes, so we had a good time last night.

48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,920
 But you know, you probably got your hair cut,

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,720
 stuffing Lai Si, passing out Lai Si,

50
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,720
 all these traditional aspects of Chinese New Year

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,640
 that we celebrate in this time.

52
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,400
 And one of the quintessential things we do

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,940
 at Chinese New Year is wear new clothes.

54
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,240
 Buy new clothes and wear new clothes, right?

55
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,280
 Especially new red clothing.

56
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,040
 It's a sign of blessing, it's a sign of the festive season.

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,440
 We love doing these things, okay?

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,960
 So, what am I wearing today?

59
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,400
 This is Uniqlo, okay?

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
 Oh, yeah.

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,600
 It's not that new even, okay?

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,200
 But it is Uniqlo, okay?

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,380
 I'm a Uniqlo kind of guy.

64
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,380
 They make good clothing for short, muscular Asian guys, okay?

65
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,640
 (audience laughing)

66
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,920
 So I like shopping there, okay?

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,240
 But it's also kind of ironic.

68
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,680
 Uniqlo, it's supposed to be unique clothing,

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
 but because they make a thousand

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,040
 or a million of the same thing, right?

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,520
 You buy new clothes at Chinese New Year,

72
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,880
 you walk out the street, everybody looks the same, right?

73
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,800
 We're all wearing Uniqlo.

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,760
 There's nothing quite unique about it.

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,160
 But they are new clothes, right?

76
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,320
 We buy new clothes at Chinese New Year

77
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,680
 as a symbol of the new blessings,

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,480
 the new things that we expect to come, right?

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,020
 This is why we get new clothes.

80
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,640
 So it got me thinking about clothing,

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,840
 and not just Chinese New Year.

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,040
 Like, you know, today we're all dressed in our best,

83
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,360
 wearing red and all this kind of stuff.

84
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,740
 But clothing, actually, we have a fascinating relationship

85
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,880
 with clothing and fashion, right?

86
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,080
 It's become a very inextricable part of our lives.

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,600
 Interestingly, though, clothing was never

88
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,320
 a part of God's original plan, all right?

89
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,160
 Genesis tells us that Adam and Eve

90
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,260
 were naked and unashamed.

91
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,260
 The word in Greek, naked, means naked, okay?

92
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,140
 Naked and unashamed, right?

93
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,680
 It was only after they sinned that they realized

94
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,680
 that they were naked, and God clothed them, right?

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,440
 The Lord made garments of sin for Adam and his wife,

96
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
 and he clothed them.

97
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,000
 And just like that, God created the first fashion line ever.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,480
 Garments of sin, the fall edition.

99
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,880
 (audience groans)

100
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,780
 You see what I did there, okay?

101
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,480
 And this is why, yeah, okay, thank you, Ken, thank you.

102
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,320
 Every morning now, we have to go through

103
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,680
 the painful decision of picking out what clothes to wear.

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,600
 But clothes are significant, right?

105
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,380
 Certain places we go have certain dress clothes,

106
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,200
 different seasons has different clothing, right?

107
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,780
 Clothing is very much a part of our cultural identity,

108
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,020
 like this I'm wearing today, right?

109
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,300
 Something a bit more traditional, a bit old school,

110
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,520
 but it's part of our cultural identity.

111
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,480
 Helps us to represent our ethnic roots, right?

112
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,280
 Or think about going to a prom or an awards ceremony

113
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,120
 or a bride on a wedding day,

114
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,880
 the exciting process of finding the perfect dress.

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,680
 Right, clothing can also be sentimental.

116
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,000
 A lot of us have the one T-shirt or that hoodie

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,940
 we've been holding on for like 25 years.

118
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,960
 We just can't get rid of it because it means so much to us

119
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,780
 and it's so soft and comfy.

120
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,760
 Clothing can even help to define history.

121
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,920
 Victorian England, right, small waist, big shoulders,

122
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,480
 that was what it was all about.

123
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,720
 '60s and '70s, all about peace signs and ponchos,

124
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,520
 that was the style back then.

125
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,740
 '80s and '90s with the neon colors

126
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,940
 and the high-waisted jeans,

127
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,640
 which are sort of making a comeback these days, I see.

128
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,080
 In the 2000s, I went through a phase

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,600
 where I thought I was a gangster rapper, okay?

130
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,640
 And so I would wear baggy jeans, the big T-shirts

131
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,160
 and the bandana around the front of my head like this, okay?

132
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,660
 Yeah, that was exciting, right?

133
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,000
 That was, okay, let me tell you about this, okay?

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,500
 So I thought I was Tupac, okay?

135
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,840
 But I wasn't quite cool enough to be Tupac,

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,560
 so my friends, true story, used to call me half-pack, okay?

137
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,240
 Because I was trying so hard to be like Tupac.

138
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,320
 But you know, clothing is important.

139
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
 That's what I was trying to say.

140
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,040
 Actually, sometimes I think it gets a bit ridiculous.

141
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,320
 We take it too far.

142
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,480
 Right, you see a Wan Chai Market T-shirt,

143
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,800
 $50, you can get a nice white T-shirt,

144
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,000
 but you put Balenciaga on it, okay?

145
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,080
 And suddenly that T-shirt is worth $500, all right?

146
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,720
 They are shoes, handbags

147
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,200
 that cost literally more than a house.

148
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,480
 I say all this just to make the point.

149
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,720
 Clothing is significant.

150
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
 It's significant because it marks us out

151
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,360
 and defines us in some sort of way.

152
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,860
 As you think about new clothes and the Chinese New Year,

153
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,680
 the big question for us this morning is this.

154
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,840
 How have we clothed ourselves?

155
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,640
 Like how does our clothing define us as a family?

156
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,520
 And when I say family, I mean us here today

157
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,880
 as followers of Jesus, that divine church in this community.

158
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
 What is it that marks us out?

159
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,220
 How do we clothe ourselves?

160
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,160
 Like when people look at us from the outside,

161
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,000
 how do these people clothe themselves?

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
 What defines them?

163
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,360
 What do you think people are saying?

164
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,960
 This is an important question to ask

165
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,440
 as we step into the new year,

166
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,040
 because we've been talking,

167
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,160
 we've come out of our January fast,

168
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,560
 we've just come out of the Exodus series not too long ago,

169
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,260
 and so we've been talking about a lot of concepts

170
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,160
 and all these kind of things,

171
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,000
 but it's time, I think, just from going,

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
 we need to go from thinking and hearing

173
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,100
 to actually start doing and being, right?

174
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,760
 In this season where we've been talking about intimacy,

175
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,920
 we actually have to start living lives of intimacy

176
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,120
 rather than just hearing about it.

177
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,280
 Lives are actually deeply connected and intimate

178
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,640
 with God and the people around us.

179
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,240
 'Cause what I hope is that when people look at us

180
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,000
 from the outside, they're saying to themselves,

181
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,640
 you know what, this group looks good.

182
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,200
 I like what they're wearing.

183
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,840
 I want to be a part of this community.

184
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,620
 I wanna be like those people too.

185
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,600
 So you could say this passage we're studying today

186
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,280
 is like the ultimate fashion guide for the church, okay?

187
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,640
 For followers of Jesus, this is the ultimate fashion guide.

188
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,280
 Because in the passage we just read,

189
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,760
 Paul uses clothes and fashion as a metaphor

190
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,480
 to describe the certain virtues and character traits

191
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,120
 that we should put on as followers of Jesus.

192
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,680
 He says this, first of all.

193
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,680
 Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved.

194
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,580
 Let's pause right there for a minute.

195
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,700
 Paul starts by reminding us about who we are.

196
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,260
 So let's remind ourselves about who we are.

197
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,820
 If you're sitting here today,

198
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,740
 or if you're listening online or in a podcast later on,

199
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,060
 and you've given your life to Jesus,

200
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,420
 you are a part of God's chosen people.

201
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,780
 You are holy, which means you have been set apart.

202
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,220
 This is what the word holy means.

203
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,340
 You have been wholly set apart by God,

204
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,420
 and he loves you dearly.

205
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,440
 You are special to him.

206
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,240
 This is who you are.

207
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,600
 This is your identity.

208
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,640
 So it has to mean something to you

209
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,640
 if that's what you want to embrace.

210
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,300
 You are holy and dearly loved.

211
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,160
 Pastor Andrew mentioned this last week

212
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,360
 when he reminded us it's out of God's intimate relationship

213
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,640
 with us that we can truly find our identity

214
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
 in who he's created us to be.

215
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,440
 He loves you, and he wants you to love him.

216
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,160
 You're set apart, which means you are different

217
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,060
 to who you were before you gave your life to Jesus.

218
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,540
 You are different to those who don't know Jesus yet.

219
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,860
 We're like people that have taken off

220
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,800
 the shabby clothes that we used to wear.

221
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,380
 Paul defines this as rage, anger, malice,

222
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,620
 slander, filthy language.

223
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,940
 These are things he says in the verses before this.

224
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,860
 We've taken off those old clothes

225
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,060
 so that we can put on new clothes.

226
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,960
 This is our starting point,

227
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,220
 because it reminds us that we are being called

228
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,500
 into something not that we do

229
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,620
 with our own ability or power.

230
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,380
 God starts this process of clothing us.

231
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,220
 We are called into this not by our own ability,

232
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,900
 not by our own power.

233
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,860
 We have been chosen by God not because we are good,

234
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,780
 but because God has been good to us, amen?

235
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,540
 We have been called holy not because we are perfect

236
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,420
 and sinless, but because God has given us his holiness.

237
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,800
 We are loved not because we're lovable,

238
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,220
 but because God chooses to love us no matter what.

239
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,780
 This is the gospel.

240
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,160
 This is the good news,

241
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,860
 and this is our starting point for today.

242
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,620
 We are chosen, holy and dearly loved,

243
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,360
 changed and renewed, which is why we must do this.

244
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,740
 We must clothe ourselves with compassion,

245
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,180
 kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.

246
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,120
 Just one more illustration.

247
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,300
 Maybe you can think about it this way.

248
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,020
 Imagine you've done some exercise,

249
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,500
 you've gone to the gym, gone for a run

250
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,740
 or something like that, you're all sweaty and gross,

251
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,940
 so you get cleaned up, you have a nice shower, okay?

252
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,900
 You're clean.

253
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,220
 You're not gonna put on those sweaty clothes again, right?

254
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,320
 You're gonna go to your closet

255
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,400
 and put on new, fresh, clean clothes.

256
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
 And so in the spirit of Chinese New Year,

257
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,620
 these are the clothes that I feel like God's trying

258
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,420
 to encourage us, all of us, to put on

259
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,540
 as we step into the year of the dragon.

260
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,760
 First thing he says is this.

261
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,180
 We have to put on clothes of compassion.

262
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,640
 Now, if compassion was an item of clothing,

263
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,600
 it might be a soft, really soft, well-fitting T-shirt,

264
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,360
 something like that, something that covers your body, okay?

265
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,460
 The word compassion actually translates

266
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,140
 as like the bowels of compassion, okay?

267
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,840
 It's something a bit more passionate than just compassion

268
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,480
 because in ancient thought, right,

269
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,540
 they thought that it's the bowels

270
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,340
 that's where emotion and feelings came from, right?

271
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,120
 And it sort of makes sense, right?

272
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,440
 Think about it this way.

273
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,240
 When you have a strong emotional reaction to something,

274
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,000
 right, you feel it right here, right, in your gut,

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 in the pit of your stomach.

276
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,460
 That's why we say something, it's like gut-wrenching

277
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,400
 when we see it, right?

278
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,260
 You feel it right here.

279
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,820
 So compassion is then when we're able

280
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,160
 to sympathize with someone.

281
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,360
 We get that feeling.

282
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,080
 We're able to sympathize with them so much

283
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,840
 that it affects our innermost being,

284
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,700
 that we have to do something about it.

285
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
 You ever had that when you see something,

286
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,280
 see someone, you just get that feeling,

287
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,180
 you know, it's like, this isn't right.

288
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,960
 I'm feeling something and I have to do something about it.

289
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,540
 It's what the Gospels tell us when it says

290
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,100
 Jesus was moved with compassion.

291
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,080
 When he saw people who were lost,

292
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,880
 when he saw people who were sick,

293
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,900
 when we saw people who were hungry,

294
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,820
 it was more than just that he felt the feeling,

295
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,260
 but it was more than that, right?

296
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,500
 This compassion led him to reach out,

297
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,680
 to love them, to heal them, and to feed them.

298
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,040
 So church, have we put on compassion?

299
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,580
 Like when we look at the world around us,

300
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,020
 when we see people today who are lost and sick

301
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,180
 and hungry and helpless, mistreated,

302
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,740
 are we so affected by it that we feel that

303
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,700
 and we actually have to do something about it

304
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,280
 to try and make it right?

305
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,660
 The first thing we need to do, church,

306
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,740
 is put on compassion together.

307
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,060
 We put on compassion so we're not just loving

308
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,020
 in word and tongue, but in deed and truth.

309
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,660
 For this is what true compassion is, love in action.

310
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,180
 Next thing Paul tells us, encourages us to put on is this,

311
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,240
 kindness.

312
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,940
 Kindness as an item of clothing

313
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,440
 could be like a pair of gloves, right?

314
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,060
 Because kindness has to do how you reach out

315
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,300
 and react to others.

316
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,020
 You could define kindness as having the attitude of Jesus

317
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,260
 towards people around you.

318
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,900
 And again, throughout scripture we see that Jesus

319
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,340
 is always kind to people,

320
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,900
 always ready to help in times of need,

321
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,140
 showing grace and mercy when he could have chosen

322
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,900
 wrath or anger instead.

323
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,940
 It's interesting, right?

324
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,480
 The Bible tells us that it's the kindness of God

325
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,220
 that leads people to change.

326
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,020
 It's the kindness of God that leads people to repentance,

327
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,480
 to recognize their sin and their need for him.

328
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,080
 So in the same way, church,

329
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,060
 we've been encouraged to put on kindness.

330
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,280
 We've been commanded even to put on kindness.

331
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,380
 Because when we put on kindness, it's like saying

332
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,980
 we now have the mind of Christ towards others.

333
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,820
 Because Jesus has been kind to us,

334
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,620
 we are called to be kind to everybody.

335
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,340
 So when that person is on the MTR and is crowded

336
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,580
 and they bump into you, your reaction is not just

337
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,000
 you step on the back of the shoe a little bit

338
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,520
 so they trip as they fall, as they get up.

339
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,600
 I don't do that, by the way, okay?

340
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,320
 I'm not teaching you guys anything, okay?

341
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,580
 But instead, you choose kindness.

342
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,320
 And if kindness that truly leads people to repentance,

343
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,500
 then kindness is actually the number one thing,

344
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,260
 one of the best things we can do

345
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,960
 to reach people with the gospel.

346
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,940
 When the world that's hurting and lost in sin comes to us,

347
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,340
 when people approach us with their messiness and their lies,

348
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,900
 how do we respond?

349
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,560
 Right?

350
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,080
 Do we bash them with the Bible, with rules and regulations?

351
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,340
 Yeah, I told you so.

352
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,200
 It's because you haven't been doing this, this, this.

353
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
 Now look, you're a mess.

354
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,560
 Is that our reaction?

355
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,260
 Do we shame them for their sin?

356
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,500
 Or which do you think will be more effective?

357
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,840
 Maybe it's reaching out in kindness

358
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,180
 to sit with them, to understand them.

359
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,740
 I would say that being kind is the most powerful thing,

360
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,860
 one of the most powerful things we can do.

361
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,900
 When the world reaches out to us, we reach out in kindness.

362
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:39,040
 Next, Paul tells us to put on humility.

363
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
 So humility I see as like a sturdy pair of socks, right?

364
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,700
 Nothing fancy, but without them,

365
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,560
 your feet get stinky and sweaty, right?

366
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,880
 You know the Cantonese saying,

367
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,140
 (speaking in foreign language)

368
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,740
 If you wear socks without shoes, right,

369
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,040
 it makes your feet stinky and it's really gross, okay?

370
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,380
 That's basically what it translates to.

371
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,100
 But I say this in the same way, okay?

372
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,900
 If we do anything without humility, it's gonna stink.

373
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,980
 If we do anything without humility,

374
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,040
 no one wants to come near it.

375
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,080
 People don't like hanging out

376
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,600
 with arrogant and proud people, right?

377
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,380
 Okay, maybe you can think about it this way.

378
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,100
 If kindness is looking at others in a Christlike way,

379
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,140
 like I just said,

380
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,960
 humility is looking at yourself in a Christlike way.

381
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,540
 C.S. Lewis puts it this way,

382
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,540
 "Humility is not thinking less about yourself,

383
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,040
 "but thinking about yourself less."

384
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,660
 So humility means that we're willing

385
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,340
 to give up our own rights

386
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,140
 so that others can have their rights.

387
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,980
 But after all, this is what Jesus did for us.

388
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,820
 Leaving his place in heaven,

389
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,660
 he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death,

390
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,780
 even death on a cross.

391
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,580
 And humility is essential

392
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,120
 for your relationship with Jesus, first of all,

393
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,940
 because how are you gonna follow somebody

394
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,140
 if you think that you know better than them?

395
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,140
 But humility is also essential

396
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,620
 for our relationship with each other,

397
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,540
 because how are you gonna sit and listen to each other

398
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,580
 when you're already looking down at them?

399
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,980
 So church, have we put on humility

400
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,460
 so we can walk out our relationship with Jesus

401
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,620
 and walk out our relationship with others?

402
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,380
 When we put on humility, we're saying,

403
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,440
 "There's no judgment here.

404
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,340
 "You are welcome to be with us."

405
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,040
 We put on humility.

406
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,220
 And then we have gentleness.

407
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,900
 You know, in the ancient world where Paul lived,

408
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,620
 gentleness was sometimes seen as something

409
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,860
 to be looked down upon,

410
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,740
 because it was seen as a weakness.

411
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,860
 Nobody ever won wars and battles by being gentle.

412
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,380
 Alexander the Great wasn't known for his gentleness.

413
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,940
 He was known for his brutality.

414
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,260
 And in those days, and even now to some extent,

415
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,720
 brutality, force, anger is how you showed strength and power.

416
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,160
 That's what gets things done.

417
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,240
 But if you look at gentleness as like a scarf,

418
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,400
 it might help us to put this in context a little bit.

419
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,840
 Scarves are like a soft, fluffy piece of material,

420
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,200
 but when it's wrapped around you right,

421
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,000
 it protects you from the cold.

422
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,040
 Even in the middle of a really cold snowstorm,

423
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,880
 if you have a scarf around you, it makes a big difference.

424
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,980
 Helps you feel warm and safe and protected.

425
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
 So gentleness then you can see,

426
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,920
 it's like strength in disguise.

427
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,120
 It's like a wild horse with all that power

428
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,060
 that's been tamed so you can control it.

429
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,720
 Think about it this way.

430
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,240
 When you get angry, when you get triggered,

431
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,760
 what's the easiest thing to do?

432
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,000
 The easiest thing to do is to react right then, then.

433
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,200
 I'm learning gentle parenting at the moment, right?

434
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,040
 And it always talks about regulate yourself

435
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,000
 before you speak to your child, okay?

436
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,360
 The easy thing to do for me though is just shout, right?

437
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,200
 Just to react.

438
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,320
 Shut up, be quiet, go to your room, things like that.

439
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,280
 Match your volume, their volume with your volume.

440
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,080
 Match their anger with rage.

441
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,700
 When you get hit in the face, the easier thing to do

442
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,580
 is to hit that person right back.

443
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,040
 So you have to understand when Jesus says

444
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,880
 if someone hits you, you're supposed to

445
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,960
 turn the other cheek, right?

446
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,200
 Think about it.

447
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,280
 That takes a lot more strength, self-control.

448
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,540
 To restrain yourself.

449
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,040
 That's not an easy thing to do.

450
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,320
 That's not a weak thing to do.

451
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,540
 But it is the gentle thing to do.

452
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,620
 And so gentleness is essential within this community

453
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,980
 for without it, we would constantly be

454
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,300
 at war with each other.

455
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,920
 Without gentleness, we would be dealing

456
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,220
 with each other harshly all the time.

457
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,320
 Without gentleness, we would just bully our way,

458
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,480
 not considering others, but just doing whatever we wanted.

459
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,940
 But the strength of gentleness,

460
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,460
 it's going to bring people together.

461
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,220
 A community that shows gentleness to each other

462
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,700
 is one that reflects God's heart towards us.

463
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,020
 A church that's known for being gentle

464
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,820
 is where people are gonna come and feel safe

465
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,420
 with their feelings, with their emotions,

466
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,300
 with their mess that we just talked about.

467
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,100
 Because they know they're gonna be met

468
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,820
 with gentleness for their burdens.

469
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,060
 But don't hear me wrong, church.

470
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,960
 It's not a weakness.

471
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,140
 It doesn't mean we just let people run over us

472
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,940
 and do whatever they want.

473
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,860
 That's not the point.

474
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,160
 Gentleness is about showing power and strength

475
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,100
 that does not condemn and put down and belittle.

476
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,820
 But rather when we reach out in gentleness,

477
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,300
 we're able to reach people with love,

478
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,380
 draw people in so then they can receive

479
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,980
 the help that they need.

480
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,660
 So we put on gentleness.

481
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,260
 Next four says we have to put on patience.

482
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,000
 Patience is like a pair of sunglasses perhaps.

483
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,320
 You could think about it that way.

484
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,940
 Right, when you put on sunglasses,

485
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,880
 it cuts out the harshness of the light

486
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
 so you can fully open your eyes

487
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,560
 and clearly see what's in front of you.

488
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,640
 In the same way, right, we need patience

489
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,340
 in order to see things and people

490
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,560
 for what and who they truly are.

491
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,000
 Patience is what's gonna help you stop,

492
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,920
 maybe seek advice if that's needed,

493
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,360
 get into a good headspace

494
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,640
 before making a decision about something.

495
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,440
 Patience is what's gonna help you stop

496
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,860
 and listen to yourself before simply just blurting out

497
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,460
 whatever comes to mind.

498
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,960
 Patience is what's gonna help you wait on the Lord

499
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,320
 instead of just going ahead with whatever plans

500
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,620
 that you had for yourself.

501
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,000
 Patience is what's gonna allow you

502
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,600
 to walk through seasons of endurance,

503
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,500
 refinement, maybe even suffering sometimes.

504
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,520
 If it's for your own good.

505
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,420
 So that's for you.

506
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,120
 But patience is also a great gift and blessing

507
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,240
 that you can offer to others as well.

508
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,840
 For if you have patience,

509
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,460
 it's gonna allow you to be able to sit in the valley

510
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,660
 with those who are hurt.

511
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,900
 Patience allows you to never stop,

512
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,140
 cease praying for those around you

513
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,340
 as scripture calls us to do.

514
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,020
 Patience will allow you to be able to hold a calm

515
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,780
 and civil conversation with someone

516
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,440
 even if you fundamentally disagree with them.

517
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,900
 We are called to put on patience

518
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,040
 because God has been patient to us.

519
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,620
 Scripture says this,

520
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,900
 the Lord is not slow in keeping his promise

521
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,980
 as some understand slowness.

522
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,260
 Instead, he has been patient with you.

523
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,300
 We're called to put on patience

524
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,500
 because the Lord God is compassionate and gracious,

525
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,100
 slow to anger and abounding in love.

526
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,460
 So church, let's put on patience.

527
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,500
 Finally, we have love.

528
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,900
 Love is what binds everything together.

529
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,820
 Love is like the big overcoat

530
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,900
 that protects and covers everything.

531
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,580
 Paul talks about love often.

532
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,020
 He describes love as the greatest of all things.

533
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,620
 He says when all things have faded away,

534
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,300
 the only thing remaining will be love.

535
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,860
 Love is the one thing that he guarantees will never fail.

536
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,060
 This is also important because here's the truth.

537
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,900
 As much effort as we do to put on these new clothes,

538
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,780
 we are not perfect people.

539
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,660
 So we're gonna need to forgive each other sometimes.

540
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,880
 If you take the illustration,

541
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,880
 sometimes we're gonna have a wardrobe malfunction, okay?

542
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,540
 Our patience runs out.

543
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,980
 We might not be as kind as we hope to be.

544
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,700
 We may respond in a harsh word

545
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,100
 instead of just taking the time to listen to someone.

546
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,940
 We may fail to truly understand each other.

547
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,340
 We act out of anger rather than kindness.

548
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,340
 When this happens, it's our love for each other

549
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,620
 that's gonna allow us to forgive.

550
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,300
 It's our love for each other that's what's gonna ensure

551
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,740
 that we don't break apart when the hard times come,

552
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,220
 but rather seek to honor and encourage each other

553
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,640
 to strive forward to be better.

554
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,820
 So love, therefore, is like the ultimate protector.

555
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,780
 And without love, we would be nothing.

556
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,140
 Finally then, Paul tells us this,

557
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,780
 that the peace of Christ rule in your hearts.

558
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,860
 The peace of Christ you can see maybe as a crown

559
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,580
 that sits above the whole outfit.

560
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,660
 Because the important thing is this, church.

561
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,980
 These aren't just virtues we follow because they're good.

562
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,180
 Good rules to be a good human being, right?

563
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,100
 That's not the point.

564
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,580
 The point is not for us just to become good people, okay?

565
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,100
 Rather, we aim for these things

566
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,380
 because we know who we belong to.

567
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,260
 We put on these things, like I said in the beginning,

568
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,740
 because the peace of Christ, we are God's people.

569
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,620
 The peace of Christ rules in our hearts.

570
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,180
 We do these things because our hearts

571
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,540
 have been so captivated by Jesus.

572
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,500
 He is the one we're trying to live like.

573
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,460
 He is the one that rules and directs how we live.

574
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,020
 That's what's gonna make the ultimate difference.

575
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,060
 It's not just about being good people.

576
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,600
 It's about being Jesus to other people.

577
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,740
 That's what's gonna keep us together as one body, right?

578
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,380
 It's not just about looking good.

579
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,900
 We wear these clothes because we are ruled by Jesus.

580
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,820
 We belong to him, we follow him.

581
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,360
 If you've noticed, all these things are things

582
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,660
 that Jesus lived out as he was on this earth.

583
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,880
 They're simply imitating who Jesus was.

584
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
 He is the one who rules our hearts,

585
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,460
 so he is the one we live for.

586
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,120
 Because ultimately, it's this.

587
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,320
 Fashion trends will come and go, right?

588
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,000
 Cargo shorts aren't cool anymore, guys, okay?

589
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,600
 Because if we're trying to look like,

590
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,920
 if what we're trying to do is just look good, right,

591
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,820
 that's gonna go out of fashion someday.

592
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,560
 But what we're trying to do, if we look like Jesus,

593
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,600
 if we're trying to be like Jesus,

594
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,480
 that's never gonna go old.

595
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
 That's never gonna run out of style.

596
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,380
 So, that let the peace of Christ rule in our hearts.

597
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:23,720
 And then Paul says this, be thankful.

598
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,920
 Now, on a day like today, I wanted specifically

599
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,280
 to end with these words because I think it helps us

600
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,920
 to keep a good perspective on Chinese New Year.

601
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,760
 Like I said, this is when I started,

602
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,680
 Chinese New Year, we step into this season,

603
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,520
 and it's very much about blessings.

604
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,800
 Actually, it's more than just blessings.

605
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,600
 It's really about getting rich, right?

606
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,640
 Gong yei fat choy, you know?

607
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,320
 I hope you get rich, I hope I get rich,

608
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,120
 and we hope everybody gets rich, okay?

609
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,600
 That's the sort of general mindset

610
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,640
 we step into this season upon.

611
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,160
 And therefore, when we just keep thinking

612
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,360
 about blessings all the time,

613
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,000
 when we keep on thinking about blessings

614
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,560
 and blessings and blessings, if we're not careful,

615
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,680
 as Pastor Andrew reminded us a few weeks ago,

616
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,880
 it's easy for this to interfere

617
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,600
 our relationship with God and others.

618
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,600
 We start to want things of God more than God himself.

619
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,040
 And then when it comes to these things,

620
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,600
 we feel like we wanna look good sometimes,

621
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,880
 just so we look like, oh, you know,

622
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,000
 I've been doing all these things,

623
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,040
 I've been a good Christian, God, bless me more.

624
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,600
 Give me more, I've been following all the rules.

625
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,440
 But like I said, it's not about that.

626
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,680
 And one of the best ways we can guard ourselves

627
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,160
 in that mindset is to be thankful.

628
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,280
 It's impossible to be resentful and thankful

629
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,360
 at the same time.

630
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,400
 And as followers of Jesus, we don't need to go

631
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,860
 to Wang Dai Hsin or Tze Kung Miu to spin the wheels,

632
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,160
 to ask for those gods, to burn incense

633
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,600
 for good fame and for good fortune, right?

634
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,240
 We don't need someone else to tell us

635
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,800
 what our fortune is gonna look like for the upcoming year,

636
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,600
 because we follow Jesus, and that's enough.

637
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,860
 Because we are thankful for the things

638
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,360
 that God has given to us, and we can be content,

639
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,320
 and that's enough.

640
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,520
 And if you wanna remind of how thankful we need to be,

641
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,120
 just take a look around you, church.

642
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,520
 These are your brothers and sisters in Christ,

643
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,760
 your family, your friends in Christ,

644
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,000
 sat around you, gathered here today.

645
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,840
 This building, this space we have right here,

646
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,640
 is a sign of God's faithfulness throughout the years

647
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,680
 that he's blessed us with already.

648
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,320
 We just need to stop and think for a minute,

649
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,640
 and help us to be thankful.

650
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,560
 Do we see fellow children of God gathered together today,

651
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,400
 dressed in the best of God's clothing,

652
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,600
 not just literally, but in the ways

653
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,320
 that we talked about just now?

654
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,400
 So as a family, church, I wonder if we could spend some time

655
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,880
 blessing each other in this way this morning.

656
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,400
 One of the things we do at Chinese New Year

657
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,000
 is to visit friends and family, to bless them,

658
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,200
 to pray with them, to spend time with them.

659
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,080
 So we're actually gonna set aside some time

660
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,240
 to do that right now.

661
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,880
 Now, there's a lot of people in this room,

662
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,760
 and if you're out in the overflow watching online,

663
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,560
 you can try and do this too.

664
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,960
 But maybe you came in with friends or family today,

665
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,880
 maybe there's people around you.

666
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,420
 Stop and take a moment right now.

667
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,580
 Remember those things that we just talked about,

668
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,720
 that you're clothed in.

669
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,640
 And then as you look around you,

670
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,180
 ask God, okay, how can I bless this person today?

671
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,140
 Maybe there's a word of encouragement,

672
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,520
 maybe it's a prayer, maybe it's a blessing

673
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,560
 you can say over them, something God places in your heart,

674
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,880
 or something that you think would be a blessing

675
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,440
 to your family in Christ right now.

676
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,080
 Okay, the band's gonna play softly.

677
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,360
 We're gonna set aside about five, 10 minutes to do this.

678
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,680
 Okay, so church, just take a moment, think about it.

679
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,880
 All right, and then start interacting

680
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,000
 with the people around you.

681
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,320
 Spend some time with your church family this morning

682
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,600
 in order to bless them, to pray for them, to encourage them.

683
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,800
 Let's bless each other by praying for them.

684
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,880
 Let's bless each other by showing compassion,

685
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,960
 kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,

686
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,480
 and see what God has to say to us

687
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,280
 as a community this morning.

688
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,720
 So come on, church, I encourage you.

689
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,600
 The band's gonna play.

690
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,680
 We're gonna spend a little bit of time doing this,

691
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,040
 and then I'm gonna come and pray for us

692
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,520
 in just a little while, okay?
