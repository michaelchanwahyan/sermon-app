[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   Hey, it is so good to be with you.
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.960]   I was gone for a couple of months, not intentionally, but I had problems returning, so you can imagine
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.960]   what happened.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.280]   Yeah, but I'm just delighted to get to spend this time with you.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.120]   And I really believe that Jesus wants to meet us here today, has already met us through
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.600]   worship, and so my prayer also has been that he will meet us through this message.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:34.160]   So in 2002, I had the privilege of participating in a discipleship training school with Mercy
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.080]   Ships.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:44.840]   Now Mercy Ships is a medical missions organization, an NGO, that has medical hospital ships and
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.820]   that docks in countries to provide life-saving, life-transforming surgeries.
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.240]   And their mission is to bring hope and healing.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:05.060]   And they do that both physically, but they also do that spiritually through their medical
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.680]   work and through sharing the love of Jesus.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:18.600]   Now I joined them in Freetown in Sierra Leone, a country in West Africa, and I spent several
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.960]   months there, and then we sailed from Freetown to The Gambia, which is another small country
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.280]   in West Africa.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.400]   Now when Mercy Ships heads to a new place, they've actually already done a ton of work
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.040]   before they ever get there.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.600]   They send a ground team there.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   They work with government officials, because you cannot just show up and, you know, decide
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.360]   you're going to do surgeries in a country.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.780]   They work with health departments.
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.480]   They work with churches.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.160]   They work with other NGOs, with community leaders, to partner with them in their work,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.840]   to spread the news about what they're doing, and to do this awesome and amazing medical
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   work.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.360]   So some of the things that they do is removing tumors.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.480]   There's a common tumor in that area where a lot of people can't afford to care for,
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.840]   just grows, and actually can really take the dignity of people and also endanger their
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.680]   lives, so they remove tumors.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.940]   They do surgeries on cleft lips.
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.780]   They do surgery on clubbed feet and lots of other things, and restorative plastic surgery.
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.980]   So it's absolutely incredible that that physical, but also that spiritual transformation that
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.980]   they bring.
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.360]   Now one of the things that Mercy Ship does when they then arrive in a dock is probably
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.480]   within a week or so, they schedule a massive medical screening.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.040]   So they--and all the people, you know, they've been spreading the news.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.860]   You can see her line, so it's up to like a thousand people or more.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.080]   Sometimes they use stadiums to do that medical screening.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.480]   And they come and they're examined by the ship's doctors, and then they schedule them
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   for surgery.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.140]   Now of course they put the most urgent surgeries first, but there is a lot of work to figure
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.200]   out, you know, when to schedule surgery, how long they take time in the ward to recover,
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.220]   but it's absolutely incredible.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.840]   So every once in a while, also people are in that line that come that cannot be helped
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.320]   medically any longer.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.040]   And so when that happens, they encourage people to go to a group of people from Mercy Ships
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.760]   that's there, that is there to care for them, but also to pray for supernatural healing.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.420]   And people have been healed.
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.160]   Now as we were sailing from Sierra Leone to the Gambia--and by the way, this was the time
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.120]   when I figured out that I'm not meant to be on a ship because I get really seasick, but--and
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.820]   he said it was even the smoothest sailing possible, so I just stay away from them now.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.840]   But as we were sailing, they told me that I would be one of the people who was going
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.920]   to pray for supernatural healing for the terminally ill.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.160]   And I have to say, I was anxious.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.760]   I was freaked out.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.760]   I was a young guy.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.880]   I had never prayed for a terminally ill person before.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.520]   Now, I don't know about you, you know, whether you would be excited about that opportunity
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.120]   or whether that'd be something where you maybe feel like I feel, a little bit anxious, you're
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.720]   not 100% sure.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.640]   So I ended up getting out of it, and here I have a confession.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.160]   I was happy.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.520]   And it's maybe not what you expected from one of your pastors.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.760]   I wasn't a pastor back then, but I was really relieved.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.800]   But looking back, I would say I actually missed an incredible opportunity to make myself available
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.400]   to God, for Him to work through me in prayer, to make myself available to the person who
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.760]   just has gotten a very difficult news, and to pray for them, to pray for healing, and
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:06.320]   in the very least, to bring God's comfort and care to that person in that situation.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.620]   So I don't know what your experience and what your practice with prayer is.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.800]   Maybe some of you, you pray a lot.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.560]   Maybe you haven't prayed in a while, or it's been even quite hard to get yourself to pray,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.560]   because you know the emotions that will come up when you go to God in prayer.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.020]   Maybe you're one of those people who gets really excited to pray for healing.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.260]   Maybe you've never done it, and you're just not sure.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.920]   Whatever your prayer journey is, and I share it from you with my prayer journey, you know,
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.280]   this is part of my prayer journey.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.600]   God wants to invite you today to be people who are bold in prayer, who pray for healing,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.920]   who bring things to Jesus in prayer, and you know what?
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.600]   Jesus loves to partner with His people.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.640]   He loves to partner with the church when they pray, and He loves to powerfully release His
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:08.960]   healing, His renewing, His restoring, His forgiving work in the lives of people and
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.640]   communities, and we get to be part of that.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.360]   He loves to partner with us.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:24.380]   So we are in our final message of our sermon series, "How We Now Live," and the topic today
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.320]   is bold in prayer.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.120]   And we're going to explore through this message, through the passage, we're going to look at
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.440]   what does it mean to be bold in prayer?
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.080]   What are we even talking about?
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:45.840]   And secondly, how might God be inviting us to be people who are bold in prayer?
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   Does that sound good?
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   Yes?
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   All right.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   I'm excited.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:57.400]   But I also want to say, sometimes when you talk about bold, being bold, we have certain
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.040]   images that come to our minds.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.280]   Maybe it's like an extrovert, you know, who's super social.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.400]   Maybe it's somebody who's praying in a loud voice, or maybe it's somebody who's very confident
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.720]   when they pray.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.720]   But that's not what bold prayer is about.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.000]   And I'm just saying this because I have the sense that some of us here today, we might
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.560]   not be feeling that bold, but I want you to know that being bold in prayer is also for
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   you.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:32.120]   Now, let me set a little bit of context for this message and this passage.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.540]   So James, the brother of Jesus, is writing to early Christian communities spread across
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:44.200]   the Mediterranean area, and the early Christians are actually going through very difficult
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   times.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.120]   They're being taken advantage of economically, so there's oppression, there's injustice,
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.280]   and there's just lots of trials that they are facing.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:03.520]   And James is encouraging them to be people who live distinct Christian lives so that
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.080]   they don't look like their surrounding culture, but that the faith in Jesus is visible in
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.920]   how they live.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.080]   And we've actually been talking about this, right?
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:21.680]   Joyful in hardship, strong in temptation, active in faith, faithful in words, and courageous
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.480]   in justice.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.320]   And today we're talking about being bold in prayer.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:35.040]   Now a lot of emphasis in James' book is also going through trials and waiting on God patiently,
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.400]   you know, that God will come through.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:44.960]   But I love how James ends this letter in a very pastoral way, because he talks to this
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.480]   church about the present availability of Jesus.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.960]   Jesus is available to you right now.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.480]   You can come to him in prayer.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.720]   And he loves the work.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.920]   He loves to move when his people come, when his church comes.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.160]   So James is encouraging them that Jesus is right there, and they can come to him with
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.480]   whatever it is that they're facing and going through, that he can act, and he does act
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.400]   right now, right here.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.280]   So let's actually read the passage in James.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:28.000]   We're in James chapter 5, and starting in verse 13 it says, "Is anyone among you in
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   trouble?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.760]   Let them pray.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.260]   Is anyone happy?
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.000]   Let them sing songs of praise.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.680]   Is anyone among you sick?
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.440]   Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.920]   the name of the Lord.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.600]   The prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.840]   The Lord will raise them up.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.520]   If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.720]   Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.240]   healed.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.960]   The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.720]   Elijah was a human being, even as we are.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:16.080]   He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain for three and a half years.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:25.000]   Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops."
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.440]   So as we're going to unpack this message, this passage, we're going to be asking a question,
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.200]   how is God inviting us to be people who are bold in prayer?
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.640]   So in verse 13, James talks about two circumstances.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:47.040]   So it says, "Is anyone among you in trouble?
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   Let them pray."
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   First circumstance.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.840]   If you're in trouble, pray.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   Second circumstance.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.600]   "Is anyone happy?
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.320]   Let them sing songs of praise."
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:06.480]   Now, it would be easy to rush on, you know, just skim over this passage, because in some
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.600]   sense it's straightforward, but I think we need to pause here a little bit and reflect
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.160]   just a little bit more on what God wants to say to us.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:24.320]   So the word that James uses for trouble, kakopatheo, it means internal distress caused by external
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.960]   circumstances.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   So that's one of the meanings.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.120]   So it's an internal distress.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.320]   Now, what is internal distress?
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.000]   We all know what we all have experienced.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.520]   It's like these running thoughts.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.520]   It's anxiousness.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.520]   It's fear.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.520]   It's panic.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.120]   Maybe even expresses itself physically through headaches, stomach aches.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.000]   So what do we do?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.400]   Do we sit there and we complain to God, you know, when we're in trouble?
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:56.520]   Do we just sit there in frustration and maybe even try to deal with it ourselves?
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.800]   Or do we bring our troubles to Jesus?
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:07.400]   And I know that I think for a lot of us, our temptation there is that we actually don't
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.560]   bring our troubles to Jesus.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.740]   That's why James is encouraging those early Christians, and also we are being encouraged
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.340]   to bring our troubles to Jesus, because we don't always do it.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:23.640]   But Jesus is readily available, and He wants to work through our prayers.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:31.400]   So being bold in prayer means that we're bringing the trouble that we are facing and experiencing
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.680]   to God in prayer.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.240]   So we can bring that to Him.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:45.800]   So what trouble are you experiencing right now that you have not brought to Jesus yet?
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.680]   And next James talks about, if you're happy, sing songs of praise.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.360]   Now remember, the early Christian community, they're actually going through a difficult
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   time, but yet there's still God's goodness.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.880]   There's still moments of happiness in there.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.340]   And James is encouraging them to praise God.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:08.240]   Now we already don't always bring our troubles to God, but I think we're even less likely
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.740]   to bring our praises to God.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.320]   And praise, by the way, is also a form of prayer.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.920]   It's thanksgiving.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.200]   And so when we think of being bold, I don't think that most of us think when we talk about
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.120]   being bold in prayer, we don't think about that actually part of bold prayer is praising
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.200]   God.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.040]   That is a bold act.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.760]   You know what makes it especially bold?
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.120]   When we're actually going through a hard time, but yet we choose to praise God for His goodness
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.120]   in our lives.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.120]   That's bold.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.320]   That's a bold declaration.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:47.320]   And so James is inviting us to be bold in prayer, means being bold in our praise, to
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.600]   declare God's goodness boldly.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.560]   That's powerful.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.240]   When you know somebody is going through a tough time, you see them praising God, man,
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.440]   I'm touched.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.440]   So we can be bold in our praise.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:08.160]   Now in verse 14, there's another circumstance that James addresses where he encourages the
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.200]   church to be prayerful in.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.120]   And they actually ask for prayer in this instance.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.160]   It says, "Is anyone among you sick?
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.680]   Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.680]   the name of the Lord."
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.560]   And I love how James empowers the sick person.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.040]   You know, you can call on others and ask others to pray for you.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.240]   And here specifically, he's encouraging for the people to call on the elders.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.280]   Now who are the elders?
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.800]   Well, elders are spiritual leaders of a community.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.960]   They oversee the community, they shepherd the community.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.680]   And so we're supposed to call on the elders to anoint us and to pray over us in the name
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.680]   of the Lord.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.440]   Now what is anointing all about?
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.440]   This anointing with oil.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:04.720]   Well, one of the meanings is a symbolic meaning that means that a person is being set apart
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.240]   for God's special care and attention.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.920]   You know, God, we're setting this person apart for God's special care and attention.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920]   I love that.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.240]   Like that symbolism of that?
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:25.600]   And then it's also symbolism of the power of the healing of Jesus, that Jesus is powerful
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.520]   and able to heal.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:35.400]   But then we're also told that the elders are supposed to pray in the name of the Lord.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.800]   Now praying, that means praying in the name of Jesus.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:45.400]   Jesus is our Lord and he has given us authority, he has given elders authority to act on his
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.960]   authority and by his power when we pray.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.320]   Now if you think about it, when Jesus sends out the disciples first in this mission to
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.680]   Israel, later on all of us, he sends us with his authority.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:02.840]   So when we pray in the name of Jesus, we're doing that on behalf of Jesus and by his power.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.720]   You are doing that on behalf of Jesus and by his power.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.640]   And he works through the prayers.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:16.800]   Now of course, not just elders can pray and anoint, you know, for healing and God works
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.120]   in this church a lot of times, also through anyone else, you know, who anoints a sick
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.560]   person and prays for healing.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.400]   But he has given elders a special authority in the church to pray for healing.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.240]   So we can come to them and we can ask for prayers.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:41.040]   So being bold in prayer involves also praying over those who are sick for supernatural healing.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:49.080]   Now I want to encourage you with a testimony from actually Pastor Ellison's mom.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.040]   So I'll read it to you.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.720]   On December 1st last year, my health took a dramatic turn for the worse.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.880]   This was very unusual.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.320]   I'm a very healthy and active person.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.840]   I was eating well and doing regular exercise.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:10.080]   But after having a fever for a few days, I fainted at home and found myself unconscious
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.840]   in the ICU.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:20.360]   I was suffering from an infection which meant the brain was swelling out of control to the
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:24.440]   point where it was life threatening.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:30.560]   They managed to get that under control, but that was just the beginning.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:37.120]   What followed was a four-month battle for my life.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.360]   Doctors were baffled.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.720]   They couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.440]   I had a consistent fever of more than 40 degrees Celsius.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:52.920]   Growth were found in my lungs, in my liver, and in my brain.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.520]   I was constantly in and out of consciousness.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:02.240]   And my family were not able to visit me due to COVID restrictions.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.200]   They told my family that I was facing a serious form of cancer which had spread all over my
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.480]   body.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.400]   The doctor even told my family that they should be prepared to say goodbye at any moment.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.800]   But it didn't make any sense.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.600]   After all I said beforehand, I was actually a healthy person and I didn't have any cancer-like
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.320]   symptoms at all.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.880]   And so we prayed.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.540]   My family prayed.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.600]   My church prayed.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.120]   My colleagues prayed.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:36.040]   And God began to work his healing.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.560]   After almost five months in the hospital, I was finally discharged.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.400]   Turns out it wasn't cancer in the end.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.080]   I still don't know the answer to what actually caused the sickness.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.040]   The best the doctors could tell me was that it was a mysterious infection.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.880]   In the end, it doesn't matter.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.120]   I know that Jesus was the one who healed me.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.440]   And he will continue to be with me for the rest of my life.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.160]   Praise God.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:13.480]   So we can ask for healing.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:19.360]   God has the power to release this healing on his people.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.200]   So now in our passage, James turns to how God works through prayer.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:32.520]   So in verse 15, it says, "And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.000]   The Lord will raise them up.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.560]   If they have sinned, they will be forgiven."
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.480]   So here we're told that a person is made well through the prayer of faith, that they can
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.520]   be healed through the prayer of faith.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.600]   Now what is the prayer of faith?
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:55.100]   Well a prayer of faith means that we have trust in the Lord, that he is able to heal.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.920]   But it also means that there is a commitment to Jesus, that we're single-minded and not
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.360]   double-minded, that we're committed to following and living the life of Jesus.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.080]   Doesn't mean we do that perfectly.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:14.320]   So the prayer of faith is offered by somebody who trusts God, who trusts Jesus, and who
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.240]   is committed to Jesus.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.600]   Sometimes when we pray, there's also special faith that is released and given to us to
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   pray for somebody for supernatural healing.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.380]   As we're praying that, the Holy Spirit reveals that God wants to heal that person.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:35.160]   And so when that happens, we can lean into that faith that God has given us to pray for
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.120]   that supernatural healing.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:49.760]   Now inherent in a prayer of faith is also that we are submitting to God's will.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:56.080]   So whether or not Jesus does his healing work in a person's life is up to God.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.020]   You know, we pray the prayer and we're called to ask for healing.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:04.380]   We should pray for that, but then ultimately it's up for God to decide what he does in
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.380]   this person's life.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.600]   And so we just entrust that to him and we hand that over to him.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.920]   You know what I love though is that Jesus invites all of us, all of us, you might not
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.140]   think of yourself that way, but all of us into this work.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.620]   Because if you're a follower of Jesus, you have been sent with authority.
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.100]   And God loves to partner with us.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.060]   Church, you have a mission.
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.500]   We have the mission to share the gospel.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.940]   We have the mission to just serve and love people and contribute to the flourishing of
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.940]   society.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.640]   But you also have a mission to pray.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:45.380]   And God wants to release his healing, his redeeming, his renewing, his forgiving work
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.660]   through prayer.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.820]   And he allows us to partner with him in that.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:57.500]   It's powerful and it's beautiful and it's encouraging that we get to co-labor with God.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.060]   Now God does the healing.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.380]   We don't do the healing, but he allows us to be part of the process.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:12.100]   And it's so encouraging when we experience God's work through our prayers.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:25.980]   So next, James, he also talks about spiritual healing, that God does not just want to heal
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.060]   us physically, but he also wants to do some spiritual healing and really some spiritual
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.020]   healing through prayer.
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:37.380]   So in verse, especially verse 16, we're encouraged, and this is the community being encouraged.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.380]   This takes place in the community.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.740]   It says, "Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.740]   may be healed."
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.620]   So we're encouraged to confess our sins to each other.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:53.980]   We're told that God wants to release his healing when we do that.
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:59.380]   Now why is James encouraging the Christian community to do this?
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.820]   Just one second.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.980]   Why is James encouraging the Christian community to do this?
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.260]   Well, he knows that we're broken people.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:17.420]   Yes, we've experienced Jesus' forgiveness and a new life in him, but we still stumble.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:25.180]   We still sin against God, against others, and then we're not fully being the people
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.100]   that God has created us to be.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.580]   But we can come to him and we can confess our sins and we can pray for each other, and
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:41.940]   he releases his healing to renew us, to forgive us, and to give us the grace to move forward
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.100]   and live by his grace.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:50.980]   Now a lot of times when we think of sin, we think of just big type of things like murder
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:56.460]   or theft, and of course that is part of it, but Jesus actually talks about that sin is
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.460]   a hard issue.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.860]   So here are some words from Jesus from the Gospel of Mark, chapter 7, verse 20 through
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:03.860]   23.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:09.300]   He says, "What comes out of a person is what defiles them, for it is from within, out of
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.140]   a person's heart, that evil thoughts come.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:19.020]   Sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander,
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.460]   arrogance, and folly.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.340]   All these evils come from inside and defile a person."
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:32.420]   So while we have beautiful and good things in our hearts, but there is also still sin
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.460]   in our hearts.
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.700]   And if we would just look at this past week, if all that has happened in our hearts, all
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:49.140]   our thoughts, our judgment, our lust, our envy, it's not very pretty.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.280]   It's not very pretty.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.580]   And I know I would be deeply embarrassed if you could see all of that that has happened
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.220]   here.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:04.180]   And so we're encouraged to bring this heart issue that we have to Jesus for him to renew
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:11.500]   us, to restore us, and to do his forgiving and healing work in our lives.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:17.500]   And a friend and also scholar, Mary Kate Morris, she writes, "Confession is part of the daily
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.540]   rhythm of prayer."
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.620]   It's actually something we can do daily.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:29.940]   It reminds us that love and wholeness is in God and not in our effort.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.260]   You know, we're not whole because of what we do.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.260]   We're whole because of what Jesus has done.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.460]   We're whole because we stand in his grace, because we receive his forgiveness.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.480]   And he wants to release this wholeness and this love in which we stand when we confess
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   our sins.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:53.360]   Now, I know that when I've confessed my sins to Chris, to close friends, and asked them
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:26:02.200]   to pray with me, that Jesus, this healing work is released, and guilt and shame is lifted.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.640]   You know, and there's a freshness and a newness.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:11.320]   And also kind of shuts down the enemy who's accusing us.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.440]   So when we confess our sins to each other, it's powerful.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.920]   And I cannot actually think of something more bold than share the stuff that's not so pretty
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.080]   with somebody and ask to pray with each other about this, right?
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.360]   So again, being bold in prayer is maybe a little bit different than what we thought.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.800]   But it's also being vulnerable and confessing our sins to each other.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.560]   And Jesus then releases his healing work on his people.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:41.160]   So being bold in prayer is regularly confessing our sin, which releases God's forgiveness
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.040]   and healing work in our lives.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:52.280]   Now finally, James goes on and he reminds us of the effectiveness and the power that
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.280]   is in prayer.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.320]   And again, why does James need to remind us?
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.560]   Well, because we forget how powerful prayer is.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.360]   We underestimate it.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.240]   We underestimate how Jesus wants to meet us and work through it when we come to him in
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.080]   prayer.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:18.880]   So in verse 16, the last part, it says, "The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.320]   effective."
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.040]   Now what is a righteous person?
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   Am I one of them?
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.840]   You might be wondering, "Does that count for me?"
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.920]   Well, here's what a righteous person is.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:34.200]   A righteous person is a person who is a Christian who stands in the grace of God, not their
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.200]   own goodness.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:44.360]   You know, somebody who has received that forgiveness and grace and who as the child of God can
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:50.240]   call on God and has access to Jesus, you know, to work through prayer.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:56.840]   And so then next, James illustrates how powerful our prayers are, and that's to encourage us.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:02.880]   And so in verse 17, he talks, he reminds the Christian community of the story of the prophet
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.880]   of Elijah.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.800]   He says, "Elijah was a human being, even as we are.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.400]   He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.800]   and a half years.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.080]   Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced crops."
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.880]   Wow.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.760]   Now it's easy to kind of raise an objection.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.160]   Actually James was anticipating that people would object, "Well, you know, Elijah, he
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.320]   was a prophet, he had like special access to God."
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.440]   But actually he said, "Elijah was a human.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.640]   He was a person like you and me, that there is no difference.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.080]   He also had his human weaknesses.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.120]   He had his anxious thoughts.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.680]   He had all of that."
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:54.480]   And so we can, anyone, we all are on the same ground when we come to Jesus in prayer.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.040]   There's a quote I want to share with you from a professor and pastor.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:05.280]   He says, "There are no extraordinary humans with unique access to God, just an extraordinary
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:14.760]   God whose power is available to all who are willing to pray."
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:20.600]   So right now I want to invite the worship team to come up, and I want to share with
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:27.640]   you a testimony of this extraordinary God and how he has met me in my life.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.680]   This is actually a continuation of the story with Mercy Ships.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.040]   So I finished my time with Mercy Ships, and I went home to Germany.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.880]   I was with my parents.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:43.840]   So beforehand I was working in a business world, and I felt that God was calling me
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:50.520]   to shift to work in a church, to be a pastor, to be a missionary, to work in that direction.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.800]   And but now I had some challenges because I had borrowed money from my parents, $10,000
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:02.720]   U.S. dollars, which by now would be like $20,000 with inflation, you know, from 20 years ago.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.520]   And I needed to pay them back.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.640]   Then I didn't know where to go for seminary.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.180]   I didn't know much about seminaries.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.180]   So where would I go?
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.520]   Where would I live?
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.000]   Then on top of it, seminary also costs, so like how am I going to pay for this?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.040]   But it was really cool.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:24.440]   Like God, I realized if God is calling me to do this, you know, he can provide for me.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.400]   And so I prayed for God's provision.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.800]   There was all these I don't knows.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.920]   You know, I don't know where I will go.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.040]   I don't know how I will pay.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:37.400]   I don't know how I'll even get into seminary.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.080]   But God answered and provided for me.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:45.400]   I ended up getting a full scholarship to seminary.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.560]   When does that ever happen?
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:54.760]   For anyone who's in seminary, they're a little stingy with giving scholarships.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:02.320]   And then after my first year, I got a job as a resident chaplain at Baylor University.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.960]   And I got free housing, free food, free Wi-Fi, free gas and electric.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:13.760]   And I even got a little stipend that after two years allowed me to pay my parents back.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:25.760]   And so God provided for me in my case financially and through that job.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.160]   But maybe in your case, his provision is different.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.760]   Maybe it's a provision of guidance when you don't know which direction to go.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.920]   Maybe it's a provision of a friendship, you know, when you're really just longing for
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.640]   a good friend or for a relationship.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.000]   So God provides in different ways.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.120]   But right now, instead of also just talking about prayer, I actually want to lead us into
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.320]   a time of prayer.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.760]   So in the next seven to ten minutes, we're going to take some time to pray together,
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.920]   to pray with each other.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.560]   Now this is something we practice at the Vine now quite regularly where we take some time.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.280]   You know, you turn to somebody you know, you turn maybe to a friend or you introduce yourself
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.640]   to someone and you share with each other how you can pray for each other and then we just
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640]   pray.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.560]   So we're going to take five to seven minutes to do that right now.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.240]   If you're online, Chapman will give you some instructions for how you can engage in this
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.240]   time.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.320]   So let's do this right now.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.720]   Let's turn to each other.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.440]   Let's bring our prayer to Jesus who is available, who loves to work through the prayers of his
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.560]   people.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   Let's do this right now.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:45.600]   Then in a few minutes, I'll come back and I'll wrap up our time.
