[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.560]   - Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.980]   Good afternoon, all of you.
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.120]   Most happy to share a word with you.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.100]   Some 30 years ago, exactly this time,
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.520]   I continued my post-graduate training.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.280]   By the way, I graduated from Hong Kong U.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.180]   I know that some of you are coming from Hong Kong U today.
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.800]   So 30 years ago, I went overseas
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920]   to this very, very small city.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.440]   Okay, don't be offended if you came from that city.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.640]   St. Louis, Missouri Midwest.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.840]   Okay, I was doing an overseas fellowship training,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.040]   and there I learned from a leading expert
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.400]   in my medical line, who had contributed tremendously
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.320]   in that particular field.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.940]   So he made numerous attempts to introduce
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.560]   various new surgical procedures
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.560]   that really was the forefront of imagination at that time.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.740]   But he overcame many hurdles and reticules along the way.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.560]   Some of his attempts failed altogether,
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.320]   but there are many others that flourished
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.520]   and changed the surgical paradigm altogether.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.520]   He always reminded us that not all new things are good,
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.100]   but all good things must be new at one time.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.300]   How true.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.320]   So in a sense, my mentor journeyed
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.880]   through many uncharted waters in his times,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.220]   where he championed the advance
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.240]   of what is now commonplace, keyhole surgery.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.160]   He contributed to bringing a whole new beginning
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.080]   in surgical practices.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.880]   And I'm glad that I rode along on that wave.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.400]   In fact, I found this word beginning an amazing word.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.100]   In Greek, it reads, "akhi,"
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.500]   which carries the meaning of origin,
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.300]   the beginning event, early days.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.700]   And I'm particularly impressed when I read through
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.700]   how different gospel writers begin their beginnings.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.740]   So through the beginning of the story of Jesus Christ
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.140]   in the Gospels of John, Luke, and Mark,
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.260]   I hoped to explore the very subject,
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.520]   passing on, ending, and new beginnings.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.340]   John 1, 1 says, "In the beginning."
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.920]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.140]   And the Word was God.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.280]   He was with God in the beginning.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.920]   Now, it is groundbreaking to have a whole new understanding
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.960]   of the word logos, which is translated as Word,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.140]   or living Word.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.260]   And to understand that Jesus is that living Word.
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.000]   John also asserts that Jesus, the Word,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.360]   was with God from the very beginning.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.540]   And you appreciate how he refers to Genesis
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.580]   when he wrote the Gospel.
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.520]   The very first verse of the entire Bible,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.480]   "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.420]   And that was exactly the same beginning.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.700]   We can read the creation account of the beginning
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.660]   as a celebration of God's goodness and faithfulness.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.080]   And indeed, when he created, he said, "This is good."
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.340]   It is significant to note that all beginnings,
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.340]   all our beginnings, are very much anchored in his beginning,
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.620]   because he is the one who begins in creation
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.120]   in the first place.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.980]   All that we have planned for is already obtained by God.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.620]   And we celebrate new beginnings exactly
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.240]   because God has been good and faithful
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.580]   from the very beginning.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.140]   How about Luke?
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.400]   Here is what he wrote.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.340]   "Many have taken to draw up an account of the things
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.960]   that had been fulfilled amongst us,
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.460]   just as they were handed down to us
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.680]   by those who from the first were eyewitnesses
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.640]   and servants of the word."
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.180]   From the first, which is the same word as beginning.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.980]   And what an awesome task.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.060]   Handed down is a very strong word
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.800]   that is really passing on something precious
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.920]   and important to the next one.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.160]   And in fact, in ancient times, including Jewish culture,
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.400]   oral tradition is the main way whereby truth
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.180]   was communicated along and from generations to generations.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.260]   In fact, passing on of the oral tradition
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.760]   was the important basis for the spread
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.200]   of early Christianity.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.560]   The gospels, as we know today,
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   was actually written much later, probably after AD 70.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.340]   By then, Jerusalem was destroyed by the Roman Empire,
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.000]   and the Jewish Christians were actually driven out
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.420]   of Jerusalem.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.140]   But through the oral tradition, through the passing on,
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.640]   the very core message of Christianity was preserved
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.620]   and subsequently written down in the gospel.
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.700]   Passing on of truth is a noble task.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.920]   The same significance of passing on
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.780]   was also emphasized by the Apostle Paul
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.980]   when he wrote to the church in Corinth.
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.560]   For what I received, I passed on to you
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.520]   as of first importance, that Christ died for our sins,
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.800]   according to the scriptures.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   The gospel permeated the entire Greek Roman world,
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.200]   and it is by believers who passed on the very truth.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.880]   The next question for us is, as modern day believers,
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.120]   what have we got to pass on to others?
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.460]   My wife and I planned carefully for what we wanted
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.360]   to pass on to our two children, who are now adults,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.860]   well, maybe some years down the road.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.520]   So we drew up a will, which was duly signed
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.140]   by eyewitnesses, that our material estate
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.400]   would be equally distributed between the two of them.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.120]   But I also wonder whether I've also passed on
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.160]   a rich spiritual inheritance to each of them.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.340]   I'm glad that as my daughter entered into marital life,
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.780]   we passed on the love that we have
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.500]   for each other as a spouse.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.080]   Besides loving God, loving our spouse
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.080]   is the single most important calling for us married people.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.360]   As for my son, who is not yet married,
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.360]   I hope I can pass on to him my love for family,
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.520]   commitment to work, independence,
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.000]   and the ability to maintain hope
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.580]   in the face of life's challenges.
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:20.600]   I do recognize that my mom passed on to me
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.080]   a lot of pessimism and worries for tomorrow.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.280]   So it takes conscious effort to connect with Jesus
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.900]   to renew my mind and my perspective
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.920]   so that I can bring joy into my own being
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.480]   and so that I can pass on joy to people around me.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.920]   How about you?
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.800]   There are practical ways that we can pass on
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.320]   our love for people, our values, our hopes, and our dreams.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.900]   I came across a few consecutive couples here in the Vine
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.920]   who are in the process of adopting children
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.240]   into their family.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.600]   What a tremendous blessing that they shall be mutually
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.760]   for parents and adoptive children for each other.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.800]   They are passing on the amazing love
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.240]   that is originated from our heavenly Father
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.160]   who calls each and every one of us into a family.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.360]   And I admire my college mate
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.680]   who quit his headmaster job altogether
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.840]   to lead an organization that is responsible
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.880]   to write up the biblical or religious studies curriculum
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.300]   for all the secondary and primary schools here in Hong Kong.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.240]   He's passing on biblical values
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.840]   to our very next generation.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.480]   And he bridged many local churches,
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.000]   including the Vine at Yuen Long,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.220]   to participate in the program.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.520]   Many congregants volunteer as mentors in these schools.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.360]   And along the way, with wisdom and with respect
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.340]   to the entire education system,
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.860]   they were able to bring many school students to Christ.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.640]   What do you want to pass on to people around you?
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.840]   And while it is still early part of the year,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.060]   how would you like to begin this year?
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.980]   Let's shall continue today's sharing on beginning and end.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.860]   In a nutshell, interestingly,
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.220]   every beginning is the end of another beginning.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.480]   And every beginning should be aimed
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.420]   towards a predetermined end.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.460]   So how are we going to understand this?
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.220]   Well, maybe we can draw a reference
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.140]   from the book of Hebrews,
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.260]   where we are asked to fix our eyes upon Jesus,
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.820]   the pioneer and perfecter of faith.
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.340]   The root word of pioneer in Greek is that of akhi,
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.340]   our key word today, beginnings.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.780]   Whereas perfecter is rooted in the Greek word,
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.680]   telos, the end.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.580]   So Jesus sees us through from the beginning to the end.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.420]   So let us throw off everything that hinders
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.500]   and the sin that so easily entangles.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.500]   And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:19.060]   fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer, the beginner,
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.160]   and the perfecter of faith.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.060]   Now we just talked about passing on,
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.260]   but paradoxically, sometimes new beginning
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.740]   is also about closure of the past.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.800]   Let's refer to the gospel of Mark
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.260]   to look at how this interesting interaction
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260]   between endings and beginning.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.920]   Mark one, the beginning of the good news
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.180]   about Jesus, the Messiah, the son of God.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.620]   As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee,
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.220]   he saw Simon and his brother Andrew
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.660]   casting a net into the lake, for they are fishermen.
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.660]   Come, follow me, and I will send you out to fish for people.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.120]   At once, they left their nets and followed him.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.540]   Now this is a call for a new beginning,
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.780]   but it actually begins with a closure of a prior chapter
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.520]   for Peter and the first disciples.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.760]   This calling of the first disciples,
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.520]   as recorded in Mark's gospel,
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.540]   is not following a particular miracle or a great sermon.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.880]   It begins as a simple call
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.140]   to four ordinary people to follow him.
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:41.480]   It's a simple call for ordinary people like us to follow him.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.440]   The Sea of Galilee is a beautiful lake.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.840]   In the first century, the main staple of food
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.060]   is actually fish, not meat in that sense.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.040]   The fishing industry in the Sea of Galilee is so prosperous
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.360]   that the catch was not only consumed in the local market.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.720]   Fish from Galilee were actually exported as far away
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.400]   as Alexandria in Egypt and Antioch in Syria.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.120]   So the fishermen in Galilee competed
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.400]   in the larger Mediterranean market,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.440]   demonstrating the skill and probably their mastery of Greek,
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.320]   which was the international language
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.840]   of commerce and culture.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.400]   So the fishermen Jesus caught
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.760]   were not necessarily just dispensable day laborers.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.900]   To survive in the market, they need to be savvy
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.480]   and are probably successful small businessmen.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.280]   On the backgrounds of these first generation disciples,
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.780]   somewhat like many of us here in this congregation,
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.060]   we work hard in the society,
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.360]   contributing in our own respective professions.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.840]   Others are working in a booming or challenging business.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.000]   And many of us are bilingual,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.520]   and some are even engaged in international trade.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.800]   Is Jesus also calling some of us,
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   or rather all of us who happen to be in this city,
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.680]   but yet by his divine purpose?
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.400]   But to start with,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.060]   there needs to be some closure to prior chapters.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:23.240]   The cross is laid on every single Christian.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.360]   The first suffering in following Jesus,
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.640]   which every believer need to experience is the call,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.820]   is the call to abandon the attachments of this world.
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.880]   As we embark on our journey to follow him,
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.880]   we surrender ourselves to Christ in union with his death,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.800]   we give our lives.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.580]   Thus it begins.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.700]   The cross meets us at the beginning of our journey.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:59.640]   Van Hove wrote very heavy words in his famous book,
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.220]   "The Cause of Discipleship."
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.140]   When Christ calls a man,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.560]   it bids him come and die.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:16.640]   Following Jesus is a costly and serious matter.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.040]   Our beginning start with letting go of the past,
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.080]   of the old is a kind of death,
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.720]   and a picking up of our cross.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.280]   I shared a very similar experience and challenge
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.360]   some 40 years ago,
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.400]   but with a very dissimilar choice
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.000]   from that of the disciples.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.660]   I was about to enter medical school,
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.540]   and on that particular summer,
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.640]   the theme of the church camp was,
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.000]   surrender ourselves to serve.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.880]   So I hesitate to embrace the call,
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.680]   and I would not like to end my chapter and my career,
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.260]   which has not even started.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.140]   So I wrestled, I made a subtle decision,
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.520]   maybe this call is not for me.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:17.260]   If anything, that should be responded
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.140]   to some years down the road.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:24.820]   Now very sadly, that deferral to some years down the road,
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.940]   to avail myself, turned out to become decades.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.340]   In fact, I backslided, I detour,
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:39.460]   and it took a long while for me to come back to Jesus.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.900]   I wondered what my path could have been
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.260]   if I had made a different response
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.200]   to the call in the first place.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.500]   Well, one never really knows,
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.780]   but as I've just shared,
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.740]   that chapter has closed,
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.400]   be it a bad or a good choice.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.820]   Fast forward, I've been attending this church
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.900]   for the past 16 years,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.700]   and I served as elder for the past nine years.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.420]   I still remember the first time
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.260]   where we gathered on a hot summer evening,
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.860]   and that was without air conditioning,
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.460]   in the unfinished auditorium,
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.380]   that we attended the very first worship service
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.780]   here in the wine.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.140]   The auditorium was as hot as a furnace,
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.420]   but our passion drove us to complete the renovation.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.420]   I also remembered in the early days,
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.840]   we were so short of cash and funds,
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.460]   we didn't even have enough money flow
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.720]   to pay our employees' monthly salaries.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.060]   We knelt, we confessed our sins,
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.320]   and we prayed for God's favor.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.520]   And it was through the faithfulness of God
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.180]   and of the congregation that sometime down the road,
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.240]   we were able to pay off the debts,
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.100]   and we remained financially stable.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.920]   Here in the church,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.480]   we also witnessed incredible growth
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.400]   beyond our imagination,
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.280]   with more than 2,400 people
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.300]   attending our four Sunday services for a season.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.560]   Yet, we also went through the challenges
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.840]   of social movements and the COVID restrictions.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.800]   After COVID, the attendance of one child
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.820]   dropped to an average of 1,500.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.500]   How shall we move forward?
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.360]   Now, interesting and amazingly,
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.680]   it was in this difficulty
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.600]   that our very first church plant at Yuen Long was burned.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.760]   Praise God.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.400]   So while serving as an elder
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.240]   and chairman of the board through this season,
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.340]   it has been instrumental and life-changing for me.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:09.920]   I want to, on behalf of the past eldership board,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.240]   and including those who have stepped down
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.000]   after many years of faithful service,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.520]   and also those who are still serving in the current board,
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.120]   we want to thank you, all of you,
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.400]   allowing us the privilege to serve
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.280]   in areas of spiritual directions,
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.400]   governance, financial prudence, and corporate leadership.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.680]   For myself, on a personal note,
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.200]   I am stepping down, and I have stepped down, by the way.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.880]   I've stepped down according to the rule of congregation,
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.800]   and I take it as a blessing in disguise.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   I did receive the word, "New wine in new wine skin."
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.640]   For anything new to happen,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.760]   there has to be an end to the prior chapter.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.000]   How I will serve in the next season
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.680]   is something that God will continue to reveal.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.400]   God willing, I do hope that there will be future occasions
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.280]   that I may stand on this pulpit
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.960]   to share God's word with all of you.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.440]   Paul could proudly say at the end of the season
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.880]   that he has fought the good fight,
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.720]   he has finished the race, and he has kept the faith.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:28.800]   However, sometimes we don't wrap up our past properly.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.480]   How do we know that we didn't end well?
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.920]   Well, when we couldn't stop thinking about the past,
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.320]   but keep on chewing on the hurtful experience,
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.760]   we felt angry and frustrated
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.360]   because of the sadness or pain in our life,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   and we struggled to encounter God in those difficult moments
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:55.360]   and we declined to enter into new commitments
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.360]   in life, in relationship, or in ministries.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.520]   Somewhere last year,
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.520]   when I no longer received the honorary academic title
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.840]   conferred to me by the university over the years,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.280]   I was really upset.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.880]   I thought, well, I made very significant contributions.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.320]   I thought I mentored many,
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.560]   and I inspired many others.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.160]   The list kept going.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.600]   But then I come to my sense,
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.920]   well, I've left the academic field
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   for good number of years.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.280]   A closure is a closure.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.800]   I can choose to embrace my new role as peers
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.200]   to my fellow colleagues,
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.440]   including those who are younger than me,
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.960]   but who may be brighter or even more skillful.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.800]   I can choose to continue to teach the medical students,
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.760]   regardless of whether I have or do not have academic title.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.280]   I can choose to fully commit myself
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.360]   to patient care on personal levels.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.800]   I can explore new ventures in life.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   By the way, I learned to play tennis since two years ago.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.280]   It would be helpful for us to consider the features
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:17.280]   of emotionally healthy endings and new beginnings.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.840]   Healthy endings and new beginnings,
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.640]   when we can patiently wait for the ending
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.840]   and the confusion in between,
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.480]   fully aware that it can take much longer
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.680]   than we can imagine.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.720]   When we realize that the ending and the waiting
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   are closely tied to our maturity in Christ,
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.280]   and we can firmly affirm that endings and waiting
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.000]   are the gateway to new beginnings.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.440]   If we accept those losses,
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.520]   whether it's work, a relationship that comes to an end,
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.360]   or even a failed ministry,
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.280]   God will work profoundly in and through us
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.800]   in the way that the apostle Paul describes.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.480]   So then, death is a work in us,
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.240]   but life is a work in you.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:18.320]   Even Jesus says, "Very truly I tell you,
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:24.480]   unless a canal of wheat falls to the ground and dies,
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.040]   it remains only a single seed.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.240]   But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.280]   If it dies, it produces many seeds."
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.200]   I don't know whether you understand
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   how the essence of cancer or cancer progression is like.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.560]   In short, cancer cells do not complete
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.560]   their original life cycle at the appropriate time,
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.080]   according to normal life design,
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.400]   but instead becomes vicious cells that drags on,
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.680]   and the culprit that endangers life.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.720]   When I was diagnosed with leukemia some years back,
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.640]   the idea of target therapy that I received
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.200]   was exactly to let the medicine create an environment
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.280]   for those cancer cells to die,
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.120]   so that healthy cells would reappear in the future.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.040]   When I received the treatment,
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.080]   I was literally thinking I was dying.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.520]   It was very, very bad.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.280]   But here I am, recently healthy and strong.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.280]   Praise God.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.880]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.720]   Praise God.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.520]   Maybe we should ask ourselves,
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:53.360]   if I accept this ending of my current life situation,
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.120]   what new things might be standing in the background,
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.040]   waiting to come into my personal life?
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.720]   What is waiting in the background,
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.560]   coming into my personal life?
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.600]   When we face the end of a chapter in our lives,
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:13.080]   God's will is not just to change the external environment.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.720]   Rather, he's doing something greater,
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.760]   initiating a deeper transformation within us
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.800]   that goes beyond our imagination.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.320]   I like the quote by Parker Palmer.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.920]   He says, "On the spiritual journey,
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.600]   "each time a door closes,
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.680]   "the rest of the world opens up.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:42.240]   "All we need to do is to stop pounding on the door
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.760]   "that just closed, but turn around."
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.760]   Indeed, we turn around and push the door behind us
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.800]   and welcome the largeness of life
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.280]   that now lies open to our souls.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.880]   So, don't pound on the closed door.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.680]   Embrace the new.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.320]   So I want to invite you to do a very prophetic act.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.720]   Okay, I want you all to stand.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.400]   Okay, follow me.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.240]   Okay.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.960]   Stand.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.360]   Okay, because we are reminded we can turn around
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.440]   and put the closed door behind us.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.280]   So all of us, turn around.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.720]   (audience laughs)
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.600]   Yes, put the closed door behind us.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.120]   Welcome the new life that God has prepared for you.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.360]   Come, please take a seat.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   (audience applauds)
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.920]   Well, but then you may want to ask,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.680]   how then should we embark on a new journey?
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.840]   Stephen Covey teaches in his best-selling book,
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.360]   "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.160]   One of the habits is paradoxically,
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.240]   begin with the end in mind.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.000]   Well, maybe Stephen have Paul's encouragement in mind
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.800]   when he writes his book.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.640]   As Paul says, "I do not consider myself
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.600]   "yet to have taken hold of it.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.400]   "But one thing I do, forgetting what is behind
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.280]   "and straining towards what is ahead.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.920]   "I press on towards the goal."
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.120]   In this chapter, Stephen challenges all of us to imagine
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.840]   attending our own funeral.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.320]   Wow.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   And we shall hear from our family, our friends,
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.400]   our colleagues, and our fellow congregants,
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.840]   how they remember us.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.560]   Well, that is indeed a challenge
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.800]   because much often we will ask,
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   well, what do I want to accomplish by the end of 2025?
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.960]   How would I like my family to be like in three years?
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:58.400]   Or what do I expect my ministry to be in five years?
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.960]   Maybe slightly longer down the road when I retire,
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.400]   what kind of legacy I would like to leave behind?
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.440]   Well, we best assure we can and we should
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.280]   set short-term goals on the way to our long-term life goals.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.240]   But the author reminds us to focus
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.240]   on the ultimate goals that really matter,
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.240]   lest we lean our leather against the wrong wall.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.200]   I try to practice this principle in my own life.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.960]   So for the past decade or so,
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.760]   we will organize a gathering of friends, family,
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.760]   coworkers, and church members every few years
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.640]   so that we can celebrate our birthday
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.200]   or our wedding anniversaries.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.400]   So about eight years ago,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.440]   we celebrated our 21st wedding anniversary.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.200]   Yay.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.000]   (audience applauding)
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.160]   Well, but we also took a very bold step
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.480]   to break the news to our guests
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.560]   that I was suffering from leukemia.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.880]   And I was about to start my treatment,
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.080]   charting into unknown waters at the time.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.560]   So I also took it as a kind of farewell
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.480]   in case the treatment didn't go well.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.240]   Fast forward on our recent six years birthday,
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.000]   two years ago,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.200]   and we asked our guests to share something
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.280]   that they would like to say about us,
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.320]   both as an encouragement and also as a measure
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.160]   of whether we have passed on something
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.440]   that is worth remembering for them.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.480]   If we kind of think deeply,
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.400]   how do I want these relatives and friends
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.800]   to evaluate my life?
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   What kind of husband, wife, father, or mother
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.760]   do we want them to remember?
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.240]   What kind of friends, what kind of work partner
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.880]   are we for them?
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.600]   What qualities do I want them to see in me?
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.320]   What contributions, what achievements
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   do I want them to remember?
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.840]   But maybe the pen ultimate question should be,
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.200]   will I be called the good and faithful servant
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.560]   that I may be invited to Jesus' banquet
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.680]   to celebrate together?
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.440]   If I look at people closely around me,
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:35.440]   what change do I want to see, make in their lives?
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.320]   So if my ultimate goal is to see the transformation
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.840]   of the life of others, I should start
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.240]   with my own personal choices, my priorities,
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.160]   and my life as a believer.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.840]   When Jesus first called Peter,
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.800]   he already had an end in mind for Peter.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.880]   It's a call to ministry, and Jesus said,
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.720]   "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of man."
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   The Greek wording is, "I will make you fishers of man."
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.120]   The Greek has the sense of making change to become.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.520]   It's a dual process, and it's a long process
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.560]   for Peter and the disciples for at least three years.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:25.080]   A call can indeed completely change our course.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.880]   About 20 years ago, when I was still living
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:32.360]   and working in Singapore, I received a call from Hong Kong.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.640]   There was an invitation for me to join
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.760]   one of the local universities, and we decided
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.920]   to take up that challenge for me professionally,
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.080]   and for the family to start a new life
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.040]   here in Hong Kong again after a 10-year stay in Singapore.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.360]   For me, that was a new beginning,
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.840]   where my end goal is to leave a legacy,
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.280]   or at least make a difference.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:03.840]   And returning that call changed the trajectory
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.560]   of my whole life.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.240]   God had a wonderful plan.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.320]   When we returned to Hong Kong and were looking for a church,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.720]   we stumbled into Divine Church,
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.280]   and Vivian and I had the privilege to serve in this church,
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.280]   especially in the Chinese ministry since then.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.560]   Well, that should be considered a surprising call,
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.280]   almost unexpected.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.720]   How about Peter?
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.960]   What happened to him upon his saying yes
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.160]   to the first call by Jesus?
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.960]   Did he continue to keep his end in mind
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.440]   while riding many ups and downs together with Jesus?
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.840]   After three years of walking with Jesus,
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.120]   Peter, along with all the other first disciples,
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.960]   and he entered into a new chapter
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.840]   where they will continue to spread the good news
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   in Jesus' absence, because Jesus will soon leave them.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.480]   They are about to begin their own new era.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.560]   John 15 says, "When the Advocate comes,
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.320]   whom Jesus will send to you from the Father,
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.280]   the Spirit of truth who goes out with the Father,
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.400]   he will testify about me, Jesus,
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.400]   and you, you also must testify,
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.360]   for you have been with me from the beginning."
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.440]   So Jesus reminds them that they have been with him
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.560]   from the beginning, a long circle,
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.080]   and we are back to the beginning.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.160]   Peter and the first disciples had the privilege
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.960]   of being in fellowship with Jesus from the very beginning,
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.440]   and they have a unique anointing.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.680]   You might have been attending the Vine
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.040]   for the past three years, or maybe just three months,
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.760]   or even three weeks, or you might have been with us
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   from that beginning, be it in Central or in Causeway Bay.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.400]   Regardless, we are blessed to be part of a new season
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.880]   for this church.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.440]   We'll be part of a new beginning,
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:20.360]   which Andrew will speak to upon next week's Vision Sunday.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.120]   God values us.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.880]   May we spread the good news and keep in mind the end goal,
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.640]   which is a citywide transformation
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   beyond Wan Chai and Yuen Long.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:40.440]   Jesus' final instructions to his first disciples
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.480]   are the same instructions to all of us here today.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:49.120]   You and you must bear witness
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:54.120]   because you have been with Jesus from the beginning.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.440]   Our context may differ, but we are in a new beginning
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.120]   that God has ordained.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.920]   The New Testament ends beautifully.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   In Revelation, it says, "I am the Alpha and the Omega,
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:14.320]   "the first and the last, the beginning and the end,
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:19.240]   "Archi and Talos, the beginning and the end."
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:23.160]   I hope that as we celebrate a new season
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.880]   for this faith community,
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.960]   each one of us will move towards our life goal.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   And my life goal, as Carla has last mentioned
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.040]   in her last sermon, don't hold back.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.880]   Yeah, don't hold back.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:41.120]   I want to give my best of myself to serve
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.320]   in years to come, whatever years he allowed.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.640]   May Divine Church continue to move
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:52.440]   towards Jesus Christ has destined for us.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.760]   Keep moving towards our goal
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.120]   so that the gospel and the kingdom of God
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.360]   will continue to be passed on.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.480]   Let's ask God to speak to us collectively
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.320]   as well as individually,
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.360]   so that we hear the call so distinctly
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.280]   and that we shall follow him boldly.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.840]   Can I invite the worship team?
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:19.800]   Yeah, and I also would like to invite all of us to stand.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.600]   In a moment's time, I would like all of us
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.920]   to consider coming forth for a time of prayer.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.840]   Yeah, because even as you hear the word today,
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.560]   and if you want a closure to the past,
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:39.560]   ask God to help you close the chapter gracefully.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.000]   And if you want to respond to God
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   to head for a new beginning, say yes to Jesus.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.120]   Come and invite Jesus to journey with you.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.280]   And if you want to pass on the blessing,
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.800]   including a personal salvation
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.600]   that has already been bestowed upon you,
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.080]   ask God to help you pass it on.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.040]   So while we respond in worship,
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.040]   in a moment's time, I invite many of you to come forth
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.000]   and that we shall pray together
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.040]   with the pastors and the prayer team.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.640]   (gentle music)
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.240]   (gentle music)
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.840]   (gentle music)
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.440]   (gentle music)
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.940]   (music fades)
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:38.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
