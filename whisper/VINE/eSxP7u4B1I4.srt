1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 So good to have you back, right?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Yes, come on.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 [Applause]

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Yeah.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Well, when I was in university,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 I was very proud

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 because I made

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 the men's basketball team.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 I know.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [Laughs]

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And on my team, there was actually

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 incredible players. They were really good.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 One of them, so much so that

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 every summer, he

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 practiced with NBA players.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 So it was like he, I was living in the

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Northwest, at that time, there was the Seattle

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Supersonics, they now moved to, I think, Oklahoma City

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 or something. And so he

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 was playing with some of those players.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Now,

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 on the men's team, there usually

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 was seven

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 or eight players that got to play

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 most of the time.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I was not one of them.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 So it was the other ones

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 played. Now, the first year, I was okay

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 with that. You know, the other players are better.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That's fine. Fantastic.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 You know, go ahead.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Second year,

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 there was one guy

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 that was playing my position who

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 was in that eight-person

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 rotation. And I felt like

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 that I had the

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 similar skill set as he did.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And I

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 started comparing myself to him.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 And as

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I was doing that, I was like, you know,

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I really

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 would deserve to have

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 a spot and be able to

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 play and be in that rotation.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 At the very least, I should get

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 the opportunity to prove myself a few

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 times. Why does he get to

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 play? Why don't I get to play?

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And so I started to

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 complain and

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 grumble inside my heart

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 as I compared myself.

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Now, before that,

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I was actually feeling great. I was so

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 proud to be on the team.

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 But when I started comparing, all that went out the window.

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Isn't that interesting how that

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 goes, right? Like when you start

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 complaining, like maybe

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 something that we enjoyed before, something

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 else good, suddenly doesn't

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 seem that good anymore.

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Now, we all experience that.

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 You know, whether that's

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 in your workplace, in a relationship,

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 in

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 church.

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 You know, in all these different

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 places we experience that. That's when we

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 start comparing ourselves, we get

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 tunnel vision.

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 We start focusing in on what the other person

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 has that we don't have that we should

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 have.

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And we kind of lose joy

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 along the way. Like we stop

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 seeing the good things that

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 God is doing in our lives.

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And a lot of times, there's a lot

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 of negative emotions

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 with that as well, right?

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And so what I want to do with you today,

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I want to explore with you a question is

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 how can we break

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 out of or

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 escape from this

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 pattern of comparing

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 ourselves with others that

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 brings us down? You know, how

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 do we get out of that? Because it's

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 so destructive and

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 it's like kills our joy.

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 You know,

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 what do we do? And what does God's

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 word have to say to us about that?

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 So we are

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 in a new sermon series

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 that we have entitled "Living

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 the Kingdom Parables."

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And Jesus, if you're familiar

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 with him, I think like 30 or 40 percent

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 of the words in the Bible

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 from him are actually parables.

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So it was one of the major ways that he

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 taught. And for those

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 of you who are not so 100 percent sure about what is

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 a parable, that sounds

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 interesting, but what is this? Here's a little

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 definition. A parable

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 is a comparison that employs

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 an ordinary circumstance

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 in everyday life to illustrate

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 a spiritual truth.

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So Jesus uses everyday examples,

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 but with that he's actually

118
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 illustrating, you know,

119
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 a truth about something else.

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 in this series we're going to look at five different

122
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 parables. Parables

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 also, they tend

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 to provoke us.

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 They tend to stir some emotions in us

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 because there's something in them that

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 rubs us the wrong way. And it's

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 usually right at that point

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 where we are rubbed the wrong way

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 that God wants to say something

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 to us. That's why Jesus uses

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 them because they're so powerful.

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And so I'm really excited about this series

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 and the heart behind it

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 is that we can align

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 ourselves with a kingdom

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 mindset, with kingdom living.

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 With the things where we are

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 not aligned with God's

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 will, Jesus' desire for us,

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 his followers, his disciples.

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Now in just

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 a moment we're going to look at the parable

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 of the laborers in the vineyard.

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 But before

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 we get there

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I want to set a little bit of context.

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Actually

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 there's a lot of things that

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 could be said about the context. It's a lot more

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 than I usually would do, but I'm going to

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 try to keep it very short.

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Basically there's a story

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 where a rich young man

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 he comes to Jesus and he wants to understand

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 how can I have eternal life?

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 But in the process of talking

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 with Jesus

159
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 he chooses

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 his wealth over following

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Jesus and he walks away

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 sad, but he's just not able

163
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 to let go of what Jesus

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 asked him to do.

165
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Now in response to this, Peter

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 who was listening

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 who has left things behind

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 he's like, "Hey, Jesus!

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 What about us?" I want to read with you

170
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 actually something that he says. So it's Matthew

171
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 19 verse 27. He says,

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 "We have left everything to follow you.

173
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 What then will be

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 there for us?"

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And it's interesting

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 because

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Jesus, he does tell Peter

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 that there will be rewards

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 for him leaving everything, that he actually

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 will bless them in incredible ways.

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 But he also

182
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 tells this parable

183
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 in response to Peter's

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 question. Because there's something

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 about the question, there's

186
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 something about the comparison that Peter did

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 to the rich young ruler where Jesus

188
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 wants to say a little bit more.

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Where there's something

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 else that needs to be said.

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And this is where we're going to pick up.

192
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 So we're in Matthew chapter 20

193
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 we're studying the response that says this,

194
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 "For the kingdom

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 of heaven is like a landowner

196
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 who went out early in the morning

197
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 to hire workers for his vineyard.

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 He agreed to pay them

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 a denarius for the day and

200
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 sent them into his vineyard.

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 About nine in the morning he went out and saw

202
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 others standing in the marketplace

203
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 doing nothing. He told

204
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard

205
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 and I will pay you whatever's right.'

206
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 So they went.

207
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 He went out again about

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 noon and about three in the afternoon

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 did the same thing. About five in the

210
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 afternoon he went out and found

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 still others standing around.

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 He asked them, 'Why have you been standing

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 here all day long doing

214
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 nothing?' 'Because no

215
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 one has hired us,' they answered.

216
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 He said to them,

217
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 'You also go and work

218
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 in my vineyard.'

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And when evening came, the owner

220
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 of the vineyard said to his foreman,

221
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 'Call the workers and pay them their wages.'

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Beginning with the last

223
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 ones hired and going to the first.

224
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 So the workers who were hired

225
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 about five in the afternoon

226
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 came and each received a denarius.

227
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 So when those came who

228
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 were hired first, they expected

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 to receive more.

230
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 But each one

231
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 of them also received a denarius.

232
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 When they

233
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 received it, they began to grumble

234
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 against the landowner.

235
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 These who were hired

236
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 last worked only one hour.

237
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 They said, 'And you have made

238
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 them equal to us

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 who have borne the

240
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 burden of the work

241
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 and the heat of the day.'

242
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 But he answered

243
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 one of them, 'I'm not being

244
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 unfair to you, friend.

245
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?

246
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Take your pay and go.

247
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I want to give

248
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 the one who was hired

249
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 last the same as I gave to you.

250
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Don't I have the right to do

251
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 what I want with my own money?

252
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Or are you envious

253
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 because I am generous?'

254
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 So the last will be first

255
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 and the first will be

256
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 last."

257
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Wow.

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 That's a lot, isn't it?

259
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 So let's

260
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 unpack that. Let's walk

261
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 through this parable. Let me highlight

262
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 some things along the way.

263
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 So the first thing is, in this

264
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 parable, it's, again,

265
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 it's an everyday scene. It's a laborer looking

266
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 for workers, the worker's vineyard.

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 So

268
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 people, he finds people

269
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 in the marketplace, he tells them,

270
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 'You want to come work in my vineyard? There's probably

271
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 the harvest. These workers are bringing the harvest.'

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And so they agree

273
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 to work for one denarius,

274
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 which basically was enough money

275
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 to pay for food for the family for that day.

276
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 But then

277
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 what's interesting is that the landowner

278
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 actually keeps going out, and it's also

279
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 interesting that the landowner does that.

280
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 You know, it's him going

281
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 out and hiring workers.

282
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Not somebody else, not one of his

283
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 employees, but he does it.

284
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And so there's other people he meets, and

285
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 they agree

286
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 that they will be paid whatever

287
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 is right, in verse 4.

288
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 So he tells them, 'I'll pay you

289
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 something that's fair.'

290
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And then he goes out at

291
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 5 o'clock, which by this

292
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 time there's only one hour left of work days.

293
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So work days usually were 12 hours.

294
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 So there's only one hour left.

295
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And he

296
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 still finds people standing around,

297
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 and he's kind of confused by that. He's like, 'Why

298
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 are they standing around? Why are you doing nothing?'

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 And they say, 'No one has

300
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 hired us.'

301
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Now,

302
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 no one, in other words,

303
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 wants them.

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 When I lived in the

305
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 US, I one time rode along with a

306
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 contractor who actually picked up

307
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 workers.

308
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 You know, it was a place where they

309
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 were waiting for work for the day.

310
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And it was interesting

311
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 because the contractors, they actually get to know

312
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 the workers. And then a lot

313
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 of times, they know who they like to

314
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 work with, but they also know maybe the

315
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 person who doesn't work that

316
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 well. And

317
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 so, I can imagine

318
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 in the setting, you know,

319
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 the workers, they knew these guys, and they're like, 'Ah, we

320
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 don't want them working for us.' So

321
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 they didn't hire them, but they hired the other guys.

322
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 But this landowner, he hires

323
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 them nonetheless for one hour.

324
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So it's interesting. It's kind of

325
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 something precarious, something

326
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 that should make us curious.

327
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 So

328
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 at the end of the day, 12 hours

329
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 worked. You know,

330
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 you have people working different hours. Some

331
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 work 12, and some work one

332
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 hour. Now, we have

333
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 to remember that this is a parable

334
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 because it's

335
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 easy to kind of lose track of that.

336
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 So in this

337
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 parable, the landowner is

338
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 God, who's calling

339
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 people into his kingdom to be his kingdom

340
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 workers. So

341
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 that's something we need to keep in mind as we continue walking

342
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 through it, okay? But let's

343
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 go on, and this is where things get

344
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 interesting, the next part. This is where

345
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 it gets juicy, as they

346
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 say.

347
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 So in verse 8 to 6,

348
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 we see that the

349
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 landowner tells the foreman, "Call the people

350
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 together. I want to pay them."

351
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And he decides to pay them

352
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 from those who came last. He

353
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 wants to pay them first, and

354
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 then pay all of them until the ones

355
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 who started in the morning.

356
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Now, what's

357
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 absolutely incredible

358
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 is that the landowner

359
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 pays those who came and

360
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 worked for one hour.

361
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 He pays them one denarius, which is

362
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 the same that he had agreed

363
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 upon for the others.

364
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And this kind of stirs

365
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 some excitement. Actually, at this point in time,

366
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 nobody minds that, that they're getting paid a denarius

367
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 because

368
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 they are expecting

369
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 that they will receive

370
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 more.

371
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 But when it's their turn to pay, to be

372
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 paid, guess what happens, right?

373
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 We already read it. They just get one denarius.

374
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Ooh.

375
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 They worked 12 hours,

376
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 the other ones worked one hour,

377
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 and they get paid the same.

378
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I don't know if you've

379
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 ever been in a work

380
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 situation where you do

381
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 a lot more, maybe somebody

382
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 else is chilling and playing video games,

383
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 and you get paid the same. It just doesn't

384
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 feel good, does it?

385
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I also,

386
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 if this was today, I wonder

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 what people would do on social media.

388
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Right? They might go on

389
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 X, is that what it's called?

390
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Twitter, is it called X? I can't remember.

391
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Okay, yeah, so they go on X,

392
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 shoot out some tweets.

393
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 If there was Google Review, they would write

394
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 a nasty review about this

395
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 horrible land

396
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 owner who is so unfair.

397
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And I think we can feel, we can have

398
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 sympathy with

399
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 that. There does seem to be some unfairness

400
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 from our perspective, right?

401
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And we can feel that.

402
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 So it's no surprise

403
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 that they actually grumble and they complain.

404
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 So in verse 11, we're told they begin

405
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 to grumble against the land owner, so they're angry

406
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 against them. And then in verse 12,

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 we're told, "These who were hired

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 last worked only one hour."

409
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 They said, "And you have made them

410
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 equal to us,

411
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 who have borne the burden

412
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 of the work and the heat of the day."

413
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 You know, "Hey,

414
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 you're making them the same as us, but we

415
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 earned, we deserve more than them.

416
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 We earned this, we have the right to this."

417
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 You know, that's what they're saying.

418
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Like, "We're not equal to

419
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 these other guys that nobody wanted to hire

420
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 that just worked one hour.

421
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 We should get more."

422
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And they're just ticked off.

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 But I want you to notice something.

424
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 All of this grumbling

425
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 and frustration,

426
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 the only reason why it happens

427
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 is because they're

428
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 comparing themselves.

429
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 If the foreman would have paid

430
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 the first-comers first and sent

431
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 them off, they would have gotten what they

432
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 agreed upon, right? One denarius,

433
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 and they go and they would have been happy.

434
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 But it was only when they compared themselves

435
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 that they got angry and frustrated

436
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 and felt like they were treated wrongly.

437
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 So comparison

438
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 can turn something that is

439
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 good into something

440
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 sour.

441
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 It's like me with

442
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 basketball. I was proud to be

443
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 on the team.

444
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I felt amazing. I made the college

445
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 basketball team.

446
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 But then when I compared myself to the one guy

447
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 who was like similar skill level, looking back

448
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 he was better than me, just being honest.

449
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But when I compared myself,

450
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 then I was grumbling, then I was complaining

451
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 and suddenly something that was good

452
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 didn't feel that good.

453
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And my joy

454
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 was drained.

455
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 But then

456
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 let's continue the story. So the landowner

457
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 he actually responds in verse 30, he says

458
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 but he answered one of them,

459
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 "I'm not being unfair to you, friend.

460
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Didn't you agree to work for

461
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 a denarius?" He reminds him of the facts.

462
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 "Take your pay and go.

463
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I want to give the ones who was hired the last

464
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 the same as I gave you.

465
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Don't I have the right to do what I want with my

466
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 own money? Or are you

467
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 envious because I

468
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 am generous?"

469
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Now it's interesting because

470
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 the workers, they're actually claiming

471
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 that the landlord is unjust and

472
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 unfair.

473
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 That he is treating them wrongly.

474
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 But he's saying, "I've actually done what

475
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I promised you. You agree to this."

476
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 So he's highlighting that.

477
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And they're

478
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 trying to make this about a justice

479
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 issue and he shifts

480
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 it and he says, "You're upset.

481
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 You're envious because I'm

482
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 generous." So he's saying

483
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 this is not about justice.

484
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 This is about envy.

485
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 This is about my generosity

486
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 with which you struggle with,

487
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 which you don't want for the other

488
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 person. That's why you're upset.

489
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Ay-yah.

490
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 This is where we get to the heart issue that Jesus

491
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 wants to address.

492
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 That he wanted to address in Peter.

493
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 That he wants to address in us.

494
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 He asks the question, "Are you envious

495
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 because I'm generous?"

496
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 And the truth

497
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 is they are envious because

498
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 he is generous.

499
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 They are envious

500
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 of the grace and mercy

501
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 that the workers

502
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 that nobody wants to hire

503
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 that maybe are not as skilled,

504
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 that look like they have a messy life,

505
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 that maybe smell like alcohol,

506
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 don't look

507
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 the way we think somebody

508
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 who is a good worker looks

509
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 because the landowner

510
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 showed them grace and mercy.

511
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And so he's saying,

512
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 "I'm envious

513
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 of the Lord and grace and mercy."

514
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 That's why they're ticked off.

515
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Now, at this point in time, again,

516
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 we have to remember we're reading a parable.

517
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 This is not a workplace

518
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 situation. This is Jesus

519
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 using life

520
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 circumstance to explain something else.

521
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And so, Jesus

522
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 in this parable,

523
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 as I already said, the landowner represents

524
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 God, and it's

525
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 actually God calling people into his

526
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 kingdom, inviting

527
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 them to be workers in

528
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 his kingdom, inviting them to give

529
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 them some work in the vineyard.

530
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 So when you're a

531
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Christian, God has

532
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 called you and he has given you a place

533
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 in the vineyard to work, every

534
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 one of us.

535
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And it is all

536
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 by the grace and by the mercy

537
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 of God. None of us deserve

538
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 it. None of us are entitled

539
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 to it. It is 100

540
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 percent the grace of God

541
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 that he calls us

542
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 and that we get to be part of his

543
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 family, that we get to be

544
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 his workers in the vineyard.

545
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 But the

546
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 reason the

547
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 early workers in this parable are so upset

548
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 is because they have forgotten that.

549
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And guess what? We forget that as

550
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 well.

551
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And we start actually thinking

552
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 about our relationship with God

553
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 a lot of times

554
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 as we think about relationships in business.

555
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 You know, they're transactional.

556
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 You owe me something.

557
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I did this, God, and you

558
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 owe me this.

559
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Why should he or she have this?

560
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I have

561
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 done this. I am entitled

562
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 to that, but you're not giving it to

563
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 me. And so we start

564
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 grumbling against the landowners. We

565
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 start grumbling against God.

566
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And our relationship with God

567
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 starts growing sour

568
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 because

569
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 we have lost sight that this

570
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 whole thing is all by the

571
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 mercy, by the grace,

572
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 by the love, by the

573
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 generosity of God.

574
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 In the kingdom of God,

575
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 it isn't about earning

576
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 or deserving, but

577
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 about receiving, saving,

578
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 grace, and joyfully

579
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 serving God.

580
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Now, what does all this have

581
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 to do with us? I know I was

582
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 just walking us through the story

583
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 trying to help us understand some of the

584
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 details a little bit better.

585
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 But what is it that this parable

586
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 exposes and challenges within our

587
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 hearts, and what does Jesus

588
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 call us to

589
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 instead?

590
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Well, the first thing is

591
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 we theoretically love grace.

592
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 We theoretically like

593
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 it. We like it when

594
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 God is gracious to us,

595
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 when he's good to us. Oh, thank

596
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 you, God, for the promotion.

597
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Thank you, God, for this that you've done in my life.

599
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 I love you. You're amazing.

600
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 So we love grace

601
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 theoretically. Well, we

602
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 start not liking it

603
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 when God's generosity and goodness

604
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 comes to somebody else, when it

605
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 comes to our competitor,

606
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 when it comes to the other family

607
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 member, when it comes to

608
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 what you can fill in the blank.

609
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 So theoretically, we like

610
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 grace, and we're like, "Yeah, I love grace. We're a

611
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 grace church."

612
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 But then when it actually comes

613
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 down to it, a lot of times we don't like it.

614
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Is this true?

615
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Yeah? I think so, right?

616
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Come on.

617
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Just having an honest conversation here.

618
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 And so perhaps

619
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 we envy a relationship,

620
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 a promotion,

621
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 success, praise,

622
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 gifts that people have,

623
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 scholarships they've been awarded,

624
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 favors from someone

625
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 you can fill in the blank.

626
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Where have you

627
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 envied God's

628
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 generosity towards somebody else?

629
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Where do you find yourself

630
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 being envious right now, and

631
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 comparing yourself, and feeling

632
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 like you are entitled,

633
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 they shouldn't be entitled?

634
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And by the way, I chose a very

635
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 safe example with the basketball team

636
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 on purpose, you know,

637
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 keeping it light and easy.

638
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Where are you

639
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 envious right now?

640
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Where you feel like you deserve

641
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 something, God owes you something.

642
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 You know, and when we compare

643
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 this to the legalistic

644
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 religion within ourselves

645
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 that actually is exposed,

646
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 when I say,

647
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 "I deserve this, why is God

648
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 giving the person that?"

649
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Really what we're saying is,

650
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 "I earned this."

651
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 But as we've said,

652
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 everything from God is something

653
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 we get by grace, by His mercy.

654
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 It's not something that we earn.

655
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 We just receive it by grace and mercy.

656
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 But so it exposes

657
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 our heart that actually

658
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 there's some works religion in there.

659
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 In us.

660
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 You know that,

661
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 and this is what Jesus is kind of teasing out

662
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 in Peter's heart, in his listeners

663
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 heart, in our heart.

664
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And we say, "That person

665
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 should not be of equal status to me.

666
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I should be of higher status.

667
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Because I did so and so,

668
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 and that person is not the same as me."

669
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 You know, and we go on and on and on.

670
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 So you will never

671
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 see the goodness of God

672
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 when you envy His generosity

673
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 towards others.

674
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 It gives you a tunnel vision.

675
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 You lose track of it.

676
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 And I don't know if you've,

677
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 you know, if you struggle with that,

678
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 it's a real struggle.

679
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Sometimes it is hard to get out of that.

680
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And I actually want us to be compassionate

681
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 and graceful towards one another,

682
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 even when we find ourselves in those places.

683
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 You know, but it's

684
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 when you're so focused

685
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 on what somebody else has

686
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 and you haven't, and you feel like you deserve it,

687
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 man,

688
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 you start losing track of all the goodness

689
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 of God in your life.

690
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 You're not able to see it.

691
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And it's just,

692
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 it's just not a

693
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 good place.

694
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And God doesn't want us to live in that place.

695
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 You know, He wants us to see His goodness,

696
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 His love, His grace,

697
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 His mercy.

698
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 He wants you to see it.

699
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 He wants you to know it.

700
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 He wants you to be confident in it.

701
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 That He is faithful to you,

702
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 His people.

703
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 But you will never see

704
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 the goodness of God when you are envious

705
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 of His generosity towards others.

706
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 So what's the anti-door to that?

707
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 What do we do?

708
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 How can we get out of this comparison trap

709
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 that leaves us being jealous

710
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 and envious?

711
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Well, the anti-door

712
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 is that we start

713
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 practicing and seeing

714
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 and giving thanks

715
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 to God's goodness and mercy.

716
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 That we cultivate this attitude

717
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 of gratitude.

718
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 I came up with another way

719
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 right before the sermon, that we practice

720
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 the art of seeing God's goodness

721
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 in our lives.

722
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 You know, we struggle with that.

723
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 But when we do that,

724
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 we start giving God thanks

725
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 for, "Wow, God, thank you for your mercy.

726
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Thank you for salvation.

727
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Thank you for your faithfulness.

728
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Thank you that you are with me,

729
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 that I know your presence.

730
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Thank you that I'm breathing today.

731
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Thank you for my health.

732
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Thank you for whatever God has been good to you.

733
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Just give Him thanks."

734
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 You know, it's amazing when we do that.

735
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Now, there's a biblical scholar,

736
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Michael J. Wilkins.

737
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 He defines gratitude this way.

738
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 He says, "Gratitude is the response

739
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 of the believing person

740
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 to the goodness of God's grace

741
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 in creation and redemption,

742
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 making gratitude

743
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 the authentic hallmark of the disciple

744
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 of Jesus."

745
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 So gratitude, so our thanks,

746
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 our praise is a response

747
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 to Jesus. And our lives

748
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 are meant to be

749
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 a response to the goodness, to the mercy

750
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 of God, where we say,

751
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 "Thank you, Jesus, for placing,

752
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 for calling me into your vineyard.

753
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And I'm going to serve you in this patch

754
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 that you put me in.

755
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And I believe that you have a purpose for me

756
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 here in this patch, that you

757
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 don't make mistakes.

758
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 And I'm going to joyfully serve you

759
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 and work for you. And I'm not going to be

760
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 focused on rewards or who gets

761
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 what. I'm just going to live

762
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 in gratitude

763
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 of your generosity

764
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 towards me, your goodness towards me."

765
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And you know, when we do that,

766
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 there's something really freeing.

767
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 When we just know that God loves us,

768
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 that we are secure, that we're

769
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 not going to miss out, that He

770
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 cares for us, that He has our

771
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 back, it just frees

772
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 us to love other people, to

773
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 serve Him and not be concerned

774
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 about us

775
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 being entitled to this or to that.

776
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And if I only had this,

777
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 then I'd be happy and all

778
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 of that. And He should not have that

779
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 and she should not have that.

780
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 It's just amazing when we

781
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 live in this gratitude and

782
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 just see God's mercy, that we're just freed

783
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 to love other people,

784
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 to do the work of God that He gives us

785
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 and to just enjoy His goodness.

786
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I was at a point

787
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 in my life where

788
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 this was not easy.

789
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 It's not always easy to

790
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 have the attitude of gratitude.

791
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And maybe if you're really feeling bad

792
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 and somebody tells you, "You should have the attitude of gratitude!"

793
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 You know, you're like,

794
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 "Hmm...

795
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 I don't know if I want to hear this right now."

796
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 So I've shared

797
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 some of the story before, but

798
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 basically, you know,

799
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 several years ago,

800
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 I had significant loss of my life,

801
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 loss of relationship,

802
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 loss of home,

803
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 loss of my job.

804
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And, you know, really

805
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 I was like, "God, I'm

806
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 serving you.

807
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 I was a

808
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 pastor. I love you.

809
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Why is my life

810
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 falling apart? And why do

811
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 people, maybe who seem like they don't care

812
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 about you that much, why are they doing good?

813
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 This is so unfair.

814
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 I deserve this."

815
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So I was complaining.

816
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I was grumbling.

817
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And I have to say, you know, sometimes when

818
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 just our life

819
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 knocks us down, sometimes that's where we're at.

820
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 You know, it's not like we can always

821
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 ride away in

822
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 the ideal place.

823
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 But that's where I was.

824
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 But it's interesting

825
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 when we

826
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 say, "Why do they have such a good life?"

827
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Actually, the reality

828
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 is,

829
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 do we really know that they have a good life?

830
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Do we know that

831
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 they don't have marital problems?

832
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Do we know that they're

833
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 not lonely in the evening

834
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 and there's tears every night?

835
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Do we know

836
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 that they're not carrying

837
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 some baggage from the past

838
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 that's just heavy, and that's just

839
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 impacting them even today?

840
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 You know, is that other person's

841
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 life, is it really

842
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 better?

843
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And because we just

844
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 see the facade, right?

845
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 That we are jealous of.

846
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And like, "Why is God generous to this person?"

847
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 But if we actually would swap lives

848
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 like completely,

849
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 maybe their life is really not that great.

850
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Maybe God's just,

851
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 you know, pouring out some goodness in this

852
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 area of their lives just to encourage them, because

853
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 the rest is so difficult.

854
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 But anyhow, I was

855
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 not thinking this way. You know, it's like, "Why

856
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 do they have a good life, and

857
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 right now my life is a mess?"

858
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And so I was talking to a friend,

859
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 and I was,

860
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 you know, sharing all this stuff with him,

861
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 and he was encouraging

862
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 me to see God's

863
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 goodness. Now I have to say, he did listen to me several

864
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 times, then only after a

865
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 while, so this was like after three conversations

866
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 or he started to talk to me

867
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 about seeing God's goodness. It was not the first thing

868
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 he told me. And

869
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 I shared with him that there was

870
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 a family

871
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 that took me in.

872
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 You know, as I had lost my

873
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 relationship, my home, my job,

874
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 that they welcomed me

875
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 into their home.

876
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 And

877
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 my goal was, "I'm just going to be here.

878
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I'm going to hide in this room

879
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 so that they allow me to stay here longer,

880
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 that they don't get annoyed and

881
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 want me out of the house, you know, just try to

882
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 clean up everything

883
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 good." But they

884
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 didn't just want me in their house. They actually

885
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 invited me to be part of their family.

886
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I had dinner with them.

887
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 I went shopping with them.

888
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I went wine tasting with them,

889
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 which was a lot of fun.

890
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 You know,

891
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 they just really loved

892
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 me and embraced me in this

893
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 difficult time where I was like

894
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 a mess, crying and all

895
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 of that. And

896
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 my friend says, "Don't you see

897
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 how much God loves you?

898
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 How he's shown you his

899
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 goodness in this difficult time through

900
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 your family?

901
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Don't you see that?"

902
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Wow.

903
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And that, I really needed

904
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 that because I couldn't see it on my own.

905
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And I could

906
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 see God's goodness. And this was

907
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 a turning point for me where I could

908
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 start giving God thanks

909
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 and

910
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 praise him, you know, for

911
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 his love and care for me despite

912
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 the difficulties and challenges that were

913
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 going on. And I was just saying, "Thank you.

914
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Thank you, Lord." And I started

915
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 slowly, you know,

916
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 naming the things in which God

917
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 has been good to me.

918
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Now, when

919
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 we have God's

920
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 grace and mercy, you know, in view, when we

921
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 get to see it, it is so

922
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 powerful.

923
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Now, for me, there

924
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 was this complaining against God. Now, I don't

925
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 think that I saw God as, like, you know,

926
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 the evil landowner who's so

927
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 unjust to me. But it was a little bit of that.

928
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 And it's amazing when

929
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 we see God's grace and mercy,

930
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 we actually can start

931
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 seeing God again as a loving

932
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 father instead of as that evil landowner

933
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 who's just harsh to us and who

934
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 messes with our lives, you know, and where

935
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 we're upset and we're angry and we're sour.

936
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And he wants

937
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 to restore that.

938
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 You know, he wants to restore our relationship

939
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 with him. He wants to

940
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 restore our joy.

941
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 He doesn't want us to live

942
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 in this place of envy

943
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 and complaining.

944
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 And

945
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 now, one thing that's also amazing about

946
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Jesus, you know, his saving

947
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 work, is that he

948
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 gives us forgiveness. Because

949
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 actually, when we're complaining,

950
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 when we're saying, "Why are you

951
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 giving them that and not me?"

952
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 You know, there's actually pride

953
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 in our hearts.

954
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 We actually need forgiveness for that.

955
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 You know, and he

956
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 forgives us and he gives us his mercy

957
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 and his grace.

958
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And he actually helps us

959
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 overcome,

960
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 you know, that so that we can be free,

961
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 that we can receive his grace and his

962
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 mercy and goodness and just walk in that.

963
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Now, I want to invite the

964
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 worship team to come up.

965
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 And my sense,

966
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 you know, for today,

967
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 is, you know, as I shared,

968
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Jesus, he tells these parables

969
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 to just highlight things in our hearts, where he's

970
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 inviting us to have a different

971
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 perspective. Where he

972
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 wants to also bring healing,

973
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 you know, the parts of our thinking,

974
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 parts of our acting,

975
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 that are not aligned with him.

976
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 And

977
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 he's inviting us today.

978
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 He's inviting you today

979
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 to

980
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 respond to him, to

981
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 come to him. Maybe

982
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 it's asking

983
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Jesus, "I'm

984
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 not seeing your goodness. I'm

985
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 not seeing what I should

986
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 be grateful for.

987
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Can you help me see it?"

988
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Maybe

989
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 that's what you bring to him. And I believe

990
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 that he will help you see it, you know, as

991
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 you ask him for that. That he will

992
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 show you, you know, his

993
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 goodness. Maybe not right in the moment, but he will

994
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 highlight that to you.

995
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Maybe it's, maybe God wants

996
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 to restore

997
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 your relationship with him. Maybe you've been

998
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 sour, you've been bitter, you've been angry

999
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 at God. Like, "How dare

1000
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 God do this to me? You know,

1001
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 why does he give, he's generous to them,

1002
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 but not to me?"

1003
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And so maybe, God

1004
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 is calling some of you,

1005
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 you know, just to find healing in that

1006
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 relationship. To not see

1007
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 God as this angry,

1008
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 unfair, unjust

1009
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 taskmaster in your life,

1010
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 but as your heavenly

1011
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Father who loves you.

1012
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 You know, who cares

1013
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 for you.

1014
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Who just pours his mercy

1015
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 and his goodness out over you.

1016
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And so what I, what I want

1017
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 to do right now, I just want to invite you actually to

1018
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 just talk to God right now.

1019
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And just to talk to him about what he's

1020
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 been speaking to you about.

1021
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And then in a little bit I'll,

1022
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 I'll lead us into what's

1023
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 next. So let's, let's do that right now.

1024
