1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 Anyway, say hello to somebody as you sit down.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,080
 Introduce yourself if you are watching online.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,480
 Introduce yourself online as well.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,720
 We would love to know who you are

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,080
 and where you're watching from.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,200
 Just tell us something about you.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,120
 We have a team online.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,440
 They love to engage with you and keep you feeling

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,600
 that you're part of what this service is,

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,200
 that you're not just watching,

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,960
 but you're actually part of this service

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,920
 and feel part of the Vine family.

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,520
 As well, wherever you are.

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,480
 Well, if you are here today

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,720
 and it is your first time in the building visiting,

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,520
 then we wanna give you a very warm welcome.

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,560
 We would love to know who you are.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,440
 So would you raise your hand, give us a wave

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,760
 so we can welcome you.

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,880
 Everybody's like, "Oh, no."

21
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,840
 Welcome.

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,320
 Yes, if you're sat next to somebody who's waving,

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,080
 give them a great big smile behind that mask.

24
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,520
 And in the upper house,

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,240
 it is good to have you join us as well.

26
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,440
 And if you're watching online

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,680
 and this is your first time tuning in, a welcome to you.

28
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,000
 My name is Carla.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,720
 I'm one of the pastors here.

30
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,320
 And if you're online, we would love to connect with you.

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,120
 So you can scan our code and send us your details.

32
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,440
 We would love for one of our team to follow up with you

33
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,960
 and maybe tell you a little bit more

34
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,640
 about who we are as well.

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,880
 And if you're here in person and visiting,

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,880
 we have a Connect Hub here just outside the auditorium.

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,680
 That's a place that you can go to to ask questions,

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,160
 find out a little bit more about who we are

39
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,600
 as The Vine Church, what we do,

40
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,960
 and how you can get more connected

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
 and feel part of this family as well.

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,560
 And everybody else, it's so good to see your faces

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,600
 behind those masks.

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,280
 Do you know, sometimes it feels like

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,440
 we've been wearing masks for so,

46
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,520
 well, I'm not wearing a mask, but yeah.

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,200
 We've been wearing a mask for so long.

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,960
 Sometimes when I see people without a mask,

49
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,280
 I'm like, "That's what you look like.

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,320
 Wow, you're so beautiful and gorgeous and handsome."

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,960
 And there are days when I am so thankful for that mask.

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,560
 You know what I'm talking about, right?

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,040
 Well, here at The Vine,

54
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,640
 there are lots of things happening all of the time,

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,280
 and this summer is no exception.

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,240
 And our children are going to be having VBS,

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,360
 Vacation Bible School.

58
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,640
 And for all of you parents out there that you know,

59
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,480
 this is such an incredible opportunity for our children

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,640
 to come together, have such a blast.

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,040
 I mean, it is fun on steroids.

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,040
 And at the same time, learn incredible truths about Jesus.

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,440
 And this year, they are looking at monumental,

64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,600
 the theme is monumental, how great is God?

65
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,080
 What a wonderful theme,

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,680
 especially for our children during this time,

67
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,040
 that they can learn that God is great.

68
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,400
 And so, of course, it's a five-day extravaganza,

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
 which means we need lots of volunteers.

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,840
 And so, if you are able to volunteer for VBS this year,

71
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,480
 it's being held from the 1st of August to the 5th of August.

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,160
 That's five days of fun.

73
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,480
 But there are so many different ways

74
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,680
 that you could potentially help or volunteer.

75
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,960
 If you are crafty and you like making props

76
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,120
 or doing some sort of curriculum support,

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,280
 you can do that prior to the event,

78
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,640
 or you can join the actual event.

79
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,280
 And there are a number of different ways

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,880
 that you can help throughout that week.

81
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,960
 So if you are able to, we would love to see you join us.

82
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,960
 It really is a fantastic time to pour into our children,

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,080
 and it's a lot of fun as well.

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,480
 It's a bit tiring, but hey, that's okay.

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,920
 And you can scan the QR code,

86
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,520
 and all the details will be there.

87
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,480
 And showing you different ways that you can volunteer as well.

88
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,080
 There are also new opportunities that are coming up

89
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,640
 through our different organisations

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,320
 that we support through our missions pathways

91
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,880
 in volunteering this summer.

92
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,600
 And they've just posted a number of different initiatives.

93
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,400
 So if you go online, check out what they are.

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,040
 You can scan the QR code,

95
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,080
 and that will give you information about other ways

96
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
 you could serve throughout the summer.

97
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,240
 If you've got a little bit of time,

98
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,960
 maybe you want to do something a little bit meaningful,

99
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,720
 that's a great way of serving the city

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,760
 through serving a lot of our local NGOs during the summer.

101
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,920
 So it'll be fun for you as well.

102
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,720
 We have also got an exciting thing happening

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,720
 at one o'clock today, and that is our baptism class.

104
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,200
 Not baptisms, had to get that right.

105
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
 Baptisms are coming.

106
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
 If you would love to be baptised,

107
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,440
 we would love to journey with you

108
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,400
 in what we at The Vine hold as our pre-baptism classes.

109
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,520
 There are three classes.

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
 It is mandatory so that you really do understand

111
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,800
 what it means to make that commitment to be baptised.

112
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,680
 So if you've been thinking about it,

113
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
 today, it's a very special offer.

114
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,480
 You get to do a walk-in.

115
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,400
 Yes!

116
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,640
 If you haven't registered and you thought to yourself,

117
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,160
 oh, I would really feel that prompting to be baptised,

118
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,800
 you can join the class at one o'clock

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,160
 in the mini hall this afternoon.

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
 And this is, of course,

121
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,920
 this is the only opportunity as a walk-in.

122
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,080
 So if you would like to do that, you are very welcome.

123
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,200
 And for many of those that have registered,

124
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,720
 it's at one o'clock in the mini hall today, first class.

125
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,480
 And then the baptisms will be at Repulse Bay

126
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,880
 later in August.

127
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,400
 Coming up in July, we have an exciting prayer walk.

128
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,240
 Yes, you get to pray and walk.

129
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,840
 How awesome is that?

130
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,520
 And guess where you're going to be prayer walking?

131
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,000
 I know, it's on the screen behind me.

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,560
 Where are we church planting?

133
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,400
 Yuen Long.

134
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,840
 Online, where are we church planting?

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,240
 Good job.

136
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,680
 Yes, we are prayer walking in Yuen Long

137
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,160
 as we prepare and as we have been preparing

138
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,320
 to plant a church in Yuen Long.

139
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,160
 So that will happen on Friday, the 22nd of July

140
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,280
 at seven o'clock.

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,520
 And if that is something that you would like to get behind,

142
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,440
 if you have two legs and you can pray,

143
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,080
 what a great way to do something to support your church

144
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,280
 and the church plant.

145
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,320
 And that is happening end of July on that Friday.

146
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,360
 You can scan the QR code for all of those details.

147
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,720
 All right, that's enough of my announcements.

148
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,920
 Yay.

149
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,560
 Now we're gonna move into that time of offering.

150
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
 So please, if you are part of our family,

151
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
 this is your local church.

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,200
 This is the opportunity that we do as a church

153
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,880
 as part of our worship to give regularly.

154
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,040
 A number of different ways showing on the screens right now.

155
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,400
 And also if you're in-house,

156
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,360
 there are envelopes on your seats.

157
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,520
 So would you join me as I pray for our offering?

158
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,840
 Father, we do thank you for your generosity.

159
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,720
 And I, on behalf of the leadership,

160
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,920
 thank our congregation for their generosity too.

161
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,720
 We cannot do what we do without resources.

162
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,040
 And Father, even though COVID has put such a stop

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,680
 on many different things,

164
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,480
 we as a church do not believe we are called to stop.

165
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,360
 We believe we are called to continue to move forward.

166
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,080
 And we do that with the many different resources

167
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,240
 that you have blessed us with

168
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,200
 and the commitment of our faithful congregation.

169
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,040
 So we thank you for that.

170
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,120
 And Father, we pray that we would have boldness

171
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,240
 to continue to step forward.

172
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,400
 We pray that you would continue to provide faithfully

173
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,720
 and generously as we continue to move forward

174
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,000
 into this city and beyond.

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,400
 We pray for our offering in Jesus' name, amen.

176
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,200
 Well, we are coming to the end of our sermon series

177
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
 on the book of Acts.

178
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,880
 But I am very excited that to end that sermon series,

179
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,120
 we have one of our founding pastors,

180
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,040
 the very, very, very, very, very, very reverend,

181
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,320
 Pastor John Snellgrove.

182
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,560
 Would you give him a great hand as we welcome him on stage?

183
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,640
 (congregation applauding)

184
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,880
 Now let's pray for John.

185
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,480
 Father, we thank you that your Holy Spirit

186
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,440
 is present here right now, wherever we may be.

187
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,440
 And Father, we pray for that anointing over John

188
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,440
 as he speaks boldly and declares the truth of your word.

189
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,920
 Jesus, would our hearts be open to receive this

190
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,760
 and would we be transformed in Jesus' name, amen.

191
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,280
 - Amen, let's hear it for Carla.

192
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,360
 Well, thank you, Carla.

193
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,800
 (congregation applauding)

194
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,560
 Wow, morning, everybody, and hi to everybody online.

195
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,600
 Great to have you with us today.

196
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,560
 But let's get straight to it this morning.

197
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,040
 Open your Bibles or take out your iPhones

198
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,000
 and turn to Acts chapter 29.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,200
 That's right, Acts 29.

200
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,680
 Come on, hurry up.

201
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,880
 I haven't got all day.

202
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,560
 Okay, I'm gonna put you out of your misery.

203
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,600
 It's a trick.

204
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,880
 It's like me saying, "Ken, I wanna invite you to dinner."

205
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,720
 You go, "Wow."

206
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,580
 "Ken, I wanna take you to the Mandarin Grill."

207
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,580
 You go, "Oh, double wow."

208
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,760
 Ken, on the 31st of September,

209
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,220
 you realize it's only 30 days in September.

210
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,900
 The last chapter of Acts, the book of Acts in our Bible

211
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,540
 is of course, Acts 28.

212
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,940
 What effect of COVID?

213
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,020
 I seem to have been watching rather a lot

214
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,940
 of Netflix series.

215
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,780
 Now, the one thing I couldn't help noticing

216
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,260
 is with movies and TV series,

217
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,580
 they always seem to have a sequel.

218
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,580
 Take "General Hospital."

219
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,100
 In June, the ABC soap reached a milestone

220
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,380
 that few other programs have seen.

221
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,380
 It broadcast its 15,000th episode.

222
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,860
 Now, how does that happen?

223
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,760
 I tell you how.

224
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:41,060
 The producers, they leave the story in the air.

225
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,400
 They create suspense.

226
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,580
 I mean, you watch a film for two hours

227
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,200
 and then there is no apparent ending, why?

228
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,180
 Because it leads to a sequel.

229
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,020
 We are talking today about the unfinished story.

230
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,300
 And may I remind you how we began

231
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,700
 the unfinished story series in March.

232
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,640
 From Acts chapter one.

233
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,520
 And yes, there is an Acts chapter one.

234
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,160
 In my former book, "Theophilus," now stop there.

235
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,380
 Luke wrote his gospel again,

236
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,720
 addressed to this guy, Theophilus.

237
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,940
 It was his friend and it means lover of God.

238
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,740
 So he said, "In my former book, my gospel, Theophilus,

239
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,740
 I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and teach

240
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,420
 until the day he was taken up to heaven

241
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,420
 after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit

242
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,020
 to the apostles he had chosen."

243
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,620
 What a great start.

244
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,060
 But have you wondered how it ends?

245
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,720
 I mean, endings matter.

246
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,720
 Whether it's a football game, whether it's a novel,

247
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,100
 whether it's a movie.

248
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,780
 Have you ever wondered how the book of Acts ends

249
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,960
 and why it ends as it does?

250
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,480
 Well, let's investigate, shall we?

251
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,700
 Now, the book has been following the apostle Paul's life

252
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,340
 through all sorts of dangers and challenges.

253
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:31,220
 He ends up in Rome under house arrest.

254
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,220
 He preaches in Rome and has some success,

255
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,620
 although not all the Jews were convinced.

256
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,620
 And then we read this, Acts 28, verse 30.

257
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,940
 For two whole years, Paul stayed there

258
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,940
 in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.

259
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,080
 He proclaimed the kingdom of God

260
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,840
 and taught about the Lord Jesus

261
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,840
 with all boldness and without hindrance.

262
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,540
 The end.

263
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,340
 So what happened next?

264
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,460
 I mean, was Paul released?

265
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,780
 Was he brought to trial before the emperor?

266
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,340
 Was he convicted and martyred?

267
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,180
 We are not told.

268
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:30,300
 I thought, what a strange way to end.

269
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,140
 Why on earth does Luke end this way?

270
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,260
 Perhaps, perhaps he finished writing Acts

271
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,620
 while Paul was still in prison.

272
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,640
 That would be about 62 AD.

273
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,220
 And that this was as far as the story had got.

274
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,140
 But this is very unlikely,

275
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,180
 since Luke almost certainly wrote it after 70

276
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,300
 because he used Mark's gospel as a source.

277
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,600
 And Mark was written about 70.

278
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,620
 So Luke probably writing in AD 80s,

279
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,900
 intended to end it here.

280
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,060
 Why?

281
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:22,420
 Well, what is the book of Acts all about?

282
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,460
 Is it about the life of Paul?

283
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,220
 No.

284
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,620
 What is it about?

285
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,540
 And most scholars agree that Acts 1:8 is the theme.

286
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,740
 It's a methodical statement.

287
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,180
 It's a critical verse, the words of the risen Jesus.

288
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,780
 And he said this,

289
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,020
 "But you will receive power

290
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,500
 "when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.

291
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:03,760
 "And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,

292
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,420
 "in all Judea and Samaria,

293
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,580
 "and to the ends of the earth."

294
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,140
 Acts is not a general history of the early church.

295
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,100
 It is not everything that Luke knows

296
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,420
 about the history of the early Christianity.

297
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,180
 It is too limited for that.

298
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,400
 There's too much that he's left out.

299
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,100
 Rather, I believe that the book of Acts

300
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,100
 is the development, the working out of Acts 1:8.

301
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,100
 So it's about the Holy Spirit coming upon them.

302
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,020
 The book of Acts is sometimes called

303
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,500
 the book of the Holy Spirit,

304
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,580
 the Acts of the Holy Spirit.

305
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,280
 We have Pentecost,

306
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,140
 then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit,

307
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,900
 addressing the Sanhedrin in Acts 4.

308
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,900
 Then the Spirit falling on the new believers in Samaria.

309
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,420
 The Spirit forbidding Paul to go to certain places

310
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,580
 and then guiding him to others.

311
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,580
 The Holy Spirit is mentioned 59 times in the book of Acts.

312
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:29,620
 And the book of Acts is about being witnesses.

313
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:36,040
 Witnesses to Jesus.

314
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,940
 He said, didn't he?

315
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,060
 "You will be my witnesses."

316
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,060
 I mean, think of Stephen.

317
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,500
 Think of Paul, Peter, Philip.

318
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,320
 We examine them all.

319
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:56,520
 But witnessing is a rather foreboding word, isn't it?

320
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:03,300
 I have to say it's somewhat of a dirty word

321
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,580
 in some church circles.

322
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,200
 Everyone says, "Oh, my faith, it's personal."

323
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:17,080
 But in Acts, it's simply telling a story.

324
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,660
 The story of Jesus,

325
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,660
 the story of how Jesus changed someone's life.

326
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,000
 The story of how Jesus changed the whole community.

327
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,900
 And it is about being witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria

328
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,700
 to the ends of the earth.

329
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,620
 So Luke tells this story.

330
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:48,780
 Jerusalem first, then they go to Samaria

331
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,580
 and then the gospel expands.

332
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,380
 Does it reach the ends of the earth?

333
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,820
 Actually, where are the ends of the earth anyway?

334
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,940
 Rome?

335
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,980
 Heck no.

336
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,400
 From a Greco-Roman perspective,

337
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,940
 Rome was the center of the earth.

338
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,020
 If you go back to Luke chapter one,

339
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,820
 or Luke chapter two, sorry, our Christmas narrative,

340
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,660
 we read of a decree going out

341
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,300
 from the Emperor Augustus in Rome

342
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,540
 to the whole inhabited world.

343
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,060
 Rome was the center.

344
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,820
 But for either Greeks or Jews or Romans,

345
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,380
 the world extends far beyond Rome

346
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,340
 to the rest of Europe, to Spain,

347
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,340
 and onwards to America, Africa, Asia, Hong Kong.

348
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:56,620
 The ends of the earth is the ends of the earth.

349
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,500
 So why does Acts end in Rome?

350
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,700
 Endings matter.

351
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,540
 Why end in Rome?

352
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,420
 I'll tell you why.

353
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:16,820
 The story is not complete.

354
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:23,140
 The story is not complete.

355
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,300
 The story is not complete.

356
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,300
 Acts 1, 8 is not fulfilled with Paul's arrival in Rome.

357
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,180
 Witnesses to be to the ends of the earth.

358
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:40,900
 That is a target beyond Rome, which is not reached in Acts.

359
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:47,060
 But the crucial point is that the ending of Acts

360
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,780
 is a non-ending.

361
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,020
 It is not an ending at all.

362
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,420
 Why not?

363
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,540
 Because Luke intended a volume three.

364
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,500
 He intended an Acts 29.

365
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,260
 Not one that he would write,

366
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,420
 but one that the Holy Spirit would write

367
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,580
 in the life of the church.

368
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,060
 Like a movie where the movie writer

369
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,940
 ends with a sequel in mind.

370
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,060
 Like "The Lord of the Rings"

371
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,980
 or "The Pirates of the Caribbean."

372
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,780
 But in this case, Luke is not gonna write volume three.

373
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,580
 Rather, the Holy Spirit will.

374
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:45,260
 With future Christians as actors.

375
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,540
 That's us.

376
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,540
 We are part of the cast of Acts.

377
00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:02,220
 But as a sort of prelude to volume three and Acts 29,

378
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,820
 I wanna look at how Luke ends volume two

379
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,020
 in Acts chapter 27 and 28.

380
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,020
 And to do that, I want to tell you a story.

381
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,140
 It's the story of a journey

382
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,580
 and a very eventful journey.

383
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,300
 A trip across the Mediterranean Sea

384
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,260
 that certainly was not a pleasure cruise.

385
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,940
 To help us navigate, I put a map on the screen.

386
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,060
 We're gonna start with our first scene,

387
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,260
 which is starting out by sailing to Rome.

388
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,860
 As we open the story in Acts 27, we are at Caesarea.

389
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,020
 And we are confronted with the statement,

390
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,020
 when it was decided that we would sail for Italy.

391
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,380
 That suggests that Paul did not travel alone to Rome,

392
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,740
 but that Luke and perhaps other disciples

393
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,320
 accompanied Paul on his journey.

394
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,660
 We certainly know of at least one more disciple

395
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,300
 that traveled with Paul.

396
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,740
 His name was Aristarchus.

397
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,800
 Because he was mentioned by Paul in Colossians

398
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
 as a fellow prisoner.

399
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,860
 From the record, it seems that the Roman governor Festus

400
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,060
 placed Paul and the Roman escorts

401
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,820
 on what we would call a freighter ship

402
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,220
 that would make many steps on the way to Italy,

403
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,980
 dropping off and picking off points.

404
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,780
 I suppose an old-fashioned deliveroo probably.

405
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,460
 Whilst unloading cargo at Sidon,

406
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,140
 Paul was allowed to go and see his friends in that city.

407
00:22:53,140 --> 00:23:00,360
 Now the story continues as Luke recounts for us

408
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,460
 the difficulty of their travel.

409
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,460
 It was the time of year that the winds had shifted

410
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,580
 and made sailing a long and dangerous task.

411
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,980
 Verse nine indicates that they were traveling

412
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,540
 at a dangerous time.

413
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,800
 Things were about to get worse.

414
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,860
 Now some background here in ancient times.

415
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,300
 Sailing the seas after September the 15th

416
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,820
 was not advisable.

417
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,140
 I guess a little bit like our mid-autumn festival

418
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,540
 here in Hong Kong, right?

419
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,620
 Cloudy weather would sit in

420
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,620
 and it would make the navigation difficult

421
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,980
 since sailors were able to navigate their position

422
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,380
 using the position of the stars.

423
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,500
 In fact, from November the 11th to March the 10th,

424
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,140
 all seafaring ships stayed in port.

425
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,780
 Now based on this information, Paul addresses the crew,

426
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,040
 stating it seems clear

427
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,960
 that the voyage is headed for disaster.

428
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,080
 However, it seems that the captain believed,

429
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,860
 ah, he could get them to Italy without harm.

430
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,460
 Therefore the centurion listened to the advice of the captain

431
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,820
 rather than the words of Paul.

432
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,440
 We read this, since they should not stay at Fairhavens,

433
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,440
 they set sail for Phoenix on Crete to winter there.

434
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,040
 And in verse 13, we're told a favorable wind helped them

435
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,160
 on their way towards Phoenix.

436
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,160
 However, the weather quickly changed

437
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,960
 as a violent Northeast wind rushed in upon them.

438
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,360
 In fact, commentators agree that this storm is a typhoon,

439
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,680
 which we in Hong Kong know very well.

440
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,100
 We had a T8 last week.

441
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,140
 And Luke literally writes that the ship was unable

442
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,380
 to face the eye of the wind.

443
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,520
 The ship became unmanageable and they had to ride it out

444
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,980
 as the wind took the bloat wherever it pleased it.

445
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,760
 As the wind drove the ship out to sea,

446
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,020
 they were able to get some shelter,

447
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,600
 providing the crew enough time

448
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,900
 to bring the lifeboat onto the ship.

449
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,060
 Next, the crew tied ropes to the ship

450
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:39,040
 to keep it from breaking apart in the violent storm.

451
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,080
 The crew then let's down the anchor to keep the ship

452
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,140
 from drifting too far out to sea.

453
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:53,040
 The storm is so bad that the crew must jettison

454
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,360
 any extra cargo from the ship.

455
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,400
 In fact, things were so bad

456
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,660
 that the crew must throw overboard the ship's gear,

457
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,460
 which would have included the main mask and its rigging.

458
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:12,080
 By verse 20, we see that hope becomes lost upon the crew.

459
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,680
 They do not believe they are gonna make it

460
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,720
 through the storm.

461
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,360
 And Paul writes in verse 20,

462
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,360
 we finally gave up all hope of being saved.

463
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,400
 It was in the midst of this despair

464
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,720
 that Paul reminds the crew,

465
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,560
 they should have listened to his words.

466
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,080
 I told you so, right?

467
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,440
 However, Paul is able to offer encouragement

468
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,680
 because we read in verse 23,

469
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,120
 the previous night, an angel of God told Paul

470
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,160
 he would stand trial before Caesar in Rome

471
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,160
 and all the people on the ship would not be saved.

472
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,720
 The people on the ship would not lose their lives,

473
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,640
 but they are not immediately to get to the destination.

474
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,640
 They will run aground on some island.

475
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,920
 Now fearing they would run aground on some rocky place,

476
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,600
 some of the sailors tried to escape the ship

477
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,560
 by getting on the lifeboat.

478
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,520
 But Paul warns the centurion

479
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,240
 that unless these men stay on the ship,

480
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,140
 he would not have his life spared.

481
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,480
 The centurion wisely listens to Paul this time

482
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,280
 and cuts the rope holding the lifeboat

483
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,820
 to prevent anyone from escaping.

484
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,160
 At this time, we learn from the book of Acts,

485
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,160
 there are 276 people on this ship.

486
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:53,200
 Knowing that the shipwreck is imminent,

487
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,800
 the crew throws grain overboard to lighten the ship,

488
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:04,200
 which leads us to scene two, which is the shipwreck.

489
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,440
 Not knowing where they are,

490
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,520
 the crew sees a bay with a beach

491
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,620
 and attempts to run the boat ashore.

492
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,640
 Running into a reef, the ship becomes jammed

493
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,800
 and the waves begin to break up the stern.

494
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,160
 The soldiers plan to kill all the prisoners

495
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,680
 so that no one would escape.

496
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,640
 However, the centurion wants to save Paul

497
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,240
 and he keeps the soldiers from carrying out their plan.

498
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,520
 Those who could swim were ordered to swim to shore

499
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,480
 while the rest would float on planks and debris

500
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,180
 on the shipwreck to shore.

501
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,920
 Once ashore, the crew find out

502
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,280
 they're on the island of Malta.

503
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,120
 We've got there.

504
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,280
 I've been there a couple of times, it's very nice.

505
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,000
 We read the local people show kindness

506
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,840
 to the shipwreck crew.

507
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,920
 They provide them with fire and hospitality,

508
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:12,120
 but, and it's a big but,

509
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,440
 while Paul was gathering wood, a viper,

510
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,540
 one of the world's deadliest snakes,

511
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:27,540
 came out and fastened itself onto his hand and gulp.

512
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,700
 The immediate reaction of the local people

513
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,280
 was that Paul was a murderer and justice was coming to him.

514
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,560
 However, Paul shook off the viper.

515
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,980
 He shook it off into the fire and suffered no harm.

516
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,560
 The locals were waiting.

517
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,180
 They expected Paul have his hand swelled up

518
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,340
 or to be killed by the snake bite.

519
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,320
 Obviously showing that the viper was poisonous.

520
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,180
 Seeing that nothing happened to Paul,

521
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,020
 the local people changed their minds

522
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,480
 and they believed he was a God.

523
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,620
 It's funny, isn't it?

524
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,660
 People are fickle.

525
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,620
 While on the island,

526
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,940
 the father of one of the leading men, Publius,

527
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,320
 suffered from fever and dysentery.

528
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,560
 After Paul prayed and laid hands upon him,

529
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,940
 the man was healed.

530
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,720
 And we read that many other on the island with illnesses

531
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,680
 came to Paul and were healed.

532
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,980
 Leads us on to our third scene, onto Rome.

533
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,300
 After waiting out the winter months,

534
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,880
 they set sail in another Alexandrian ship

535
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
 which had wintered there.

536
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,960
 Finally, after much turmoil,

537
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,960
 you'll see from the map, Paul reaches Rome.

538
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:05,920
 Once in Rome, Paul was permitted to stay by himself

539
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,800
 with the Roman soldier who guarded him.

540
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,540
 After three days, Paul summoned the Jewish leaders

541
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,260
 and gives an explanation as to why he has come to Rome

542
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,420
 and why he's in chains.

543
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:26,300
 This gave an opportunity for Paul to preach all day long

544
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,360
 concerning the kingdom of God

545
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,980
 and persuade them concerning Jesus.

546
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,020
 We read in verse 24 that some were persuaded

547
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,640
 but others did not believe.

548
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,100
 And so Paul concluded his teaching

549
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,400
 to those who were leaving,

550
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,660
 saying they were fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah.

551
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,140
 Isaiah said they were being unwilling to see and hear

552
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,760
 about the great work that God had done through Christ.

553
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,060
 Therefore, Paul would go and preach his message

554
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,340
 to the Gentiles.

555
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,620
 Let me remind you this.

556
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,580
 For two whole years,

557
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,260
 Paul stayed there in his own rented house

558
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,660
 and welcomed all who'd come to see him.

559
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,740
 He proclaimed the kingdom of God

560
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,820
 and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ,

561
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,320
 all with a boldness and without hindrance.

562
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,860
 What an amazing story.

563
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,180
 I mean, it beats Johnny Depp and the pirates, doesn't it?

564
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:34,900
 But what are the applications?

565
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,500
 What does it mean for us?

566
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,040
 I'd like to highlight three things.

567
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:49,380
 Number one, trusting God in all circumstances.

568
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:55,780
 One of the first lessons we clearly see in this story

569
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,260
 is the disciples' ability to trust God at all times.

570
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,540
 Paul went from the Jews plotting his death in Jerusalem

571
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,120
 to the foolishness of the captain in the bad weather.

572
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:16,620
 And all Paul had to hold onto was God's promise

573
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,280
 that he would testify about the Lord in Rome.

574
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,580
 But even those words would have been difficult to believe

575
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,820
 when you're on a ship in the middle of a typhoon.

576
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:35,860
 In Acts 27, 20, we see the hopelessness of the situation.

577
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,620
 He said this, "When neither sun nor stars

578
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,820
 "appeared for many days and the storm continued raging,

579
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,820
 "we finally gave up all hope of being saved."

580
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:55,980
 The hopes that they would get out of that mess were lost.

581
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,140
 They believed, didn't they?

582
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,580
 We're all gonna die.

583
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,200
 The storm was unexpected.

584
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,680
 The storm was unmanageable.

585
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,780
 The storm was unrelenting.

586
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,280
 A passing thought.

587
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,660
 Isn't life like that sometimes?

588
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:25,760
 We often face many storms in life.

589
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,460
 But even though we face many storms,

590
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,000
 we can still have a spirit of thanksgiving in our hearts

591
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,400
 in the midst of a storm.

592
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,600
 Paul stands up and declares

593
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,460
 that there will be no loss of life.

594
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,520
 Why?

595
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,640
 Because God says so.

596
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,160
 We see the confidence of Paul

597
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,260
 that God was gonna bring him through.

598
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:55,840
 We cannot overemphasize the confidence

599
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,740
 that we must develop in our faith in God

600
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,880
 that no matter how difficult things get,

601
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,900
 God will remain with us.

602
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,480
 We cannot forget and we must always believe

603
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,840
 that there is nothing that we are experiencing

604
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,280
 that is not common to others as well.

605
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,680
 What an amazing service we had

606
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,400
 with Branches of Hope last week.

607
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,400
 We saw, didn't we, only last week

608
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,080
 from those in our road community, in our stop community.

609
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,120
 We have a great many people at this very church

610
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,940
 who have shown great strength.

611
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,520
 I'll be honest with you.

612
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,320
 Their levels of faith make mine look weak sometimes.

613
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,880
 If God will not allow us to go through

614
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,480
 more than we can handle,

615
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,120
 then church, we have some very strong Christians

616
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,060
 in our midst.

617
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,560
 If we're not that strong yet,

618
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,200
 we can become that strong in our faith.

619
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,280
 We can take strength from the faith of those who are here.

620
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,380
 We are an encouragement to each other

621
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,200
 as we go through our difficulties.

622
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,800
 We feel the pain together,

623
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,360
 but we share in the strength of each other's faith.

624
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,600
 So that's the first application.

625
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,980
 The second application is this,

626
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:35,260
 preaching in all circumstances.

627
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,320
 I love this guy, Paul.

628
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,720
 He never missed, never wasted an opportunity.

629
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,000
 How about Paul preaching in every circumstance

630
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,320
 he found himself in?

631
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,720
 What an amazing man.

632
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,520
 It didn't matter what was going on in his life.

633
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,960
 His first thoughts would be evangelistic.

634
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,680
 Just days after arriving in Rome,

635
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,600
 Paul calls for the Jewish leaders

636
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,160
 to begin to teach to them.

637
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,120
 When Paul was on a house arrest,

638
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,400
 he preached not only to the people who came to see him,

639
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,800
 but even to the Roman guards to whom he was chained.

640
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,200
 That's a captive audience, isn't it?

641
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,880
 Every soldier that was chained to him

642
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,160
 would hear about the kingdom of God

643
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,140
 and the message of Jesus Christ.

644
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,760
 Finally, Paul had run through every guard.

645
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,600
 So that he could say that his imprisonment

646
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,040
 had actually furthered the gospel.

647
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,480
 And the gospel had been spread

648
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,760
 throughout the whole imperial guard.

649
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,400
 What about us?

650
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,880
 We are called to preach the gospel in all circumstances.

651
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,960
 We must persist in proclaiming the gospel message.

652
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,760
 Can you imagine teaching Caesar's household?

653
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,820
 Could you imagine preaching to the imperial guard of Rome?

654
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,540
 Unfortunately, our motto has been this.

655
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:17,620
 Preach the gospel under no circumstances.

656
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,960
 We come up with excuses, don't we?

657
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,000
 Not to speak about the word of God

658
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,380
 in nearly every instance arises.

659
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,460
 We assume that person doesn't want to hear.

660
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,580
 We think it's not a good time.

661
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,180
 Is it ever a good time?

662
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,160
 Or are we just soothing our consciences

663
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,100
 because we know we need to be workers in God's kingdom?

664
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,100
 My friends, preach and teach in all circumstances.

665
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,680
 Let nothing hinder us from the work of the Lord.

666
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,820
 Our last application is this.

667
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:02,640
 Encouraging others in all circumstances.

668
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,900
 As I look at these chapters we just read,

669
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,820
 what an encourager Paul had become.

670
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,500
 When we look at the book of Acts, we say Barnabas.

671
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,380
 Oh yeah, Barnabas was known as the son of encouragement.

672
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,420
 But Paul did a great work

673
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,100
 in encouraging the saints and the unbelievers.

674
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,300
 It is from this house arrest

675
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,980
 that we believe Paul wrote many letters,

676
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,620
 including Colossians, Philippians and Ephesians.

677
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,460
 I'm gonna make a suggestion to you.

678
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,860
 I'm gonna suggest you take some time this week

679
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:45,780
 and that you read Colossians, Philippians and Ephesians.

680
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,740
 And you remember as you read them,

681
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,020
 you read them in the light

682
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,400
 that these were Paul's words that Paul wrote

683
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000
 while he was under house arrest.

684
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,940
 Did tough times stop us from being encouragers of others

685
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,940
 that we ought to be?

686
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,980
 Paul would acknowledge his condition,

687
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,220
 but turn his attention to the needs of others,

688
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,780
 encouraging them to be strong in the Lord

689
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,380
 and never turn away from the truth.

690
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,340
 We too can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.

691
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:28,020
 In all circumstances, let us always trust God,

692
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,180
 preach God and encourage others in the faith.

693
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,580
 As Paul said in 1 Corinthians 11,

694
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,340
 "Imitate me as I imitate Christ."

695
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:42,080
 My dear friends,

696
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,900
 although the book has finished,

697
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,020
 our sermon series has finished as well.

698
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,480
 The story has not.

699
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:00,280
 Luke finishes with a subliminal message to be continued.

700
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:07,540
 The open ending tells us that

701
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,780
 we as the readers

702
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,660
 are to finish the story.

703
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,760
 We continue the writing.

704
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,220
 It is to include the readers,

705
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,460
 you in the continuing work of spreading the word.

706
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:34,020
 It challenges us to press on with the unfinished task.

707
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:42,080
 But what are the contents of Acts 29?

708
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,460
 What is the script for volume three?

709
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,200
 The clue is found again in Acts 1.8.

710
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,600
 You will receive power when the Holy Spirit

711
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,640
 has come upon you.

712
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,600
 There's no full stop by that.

713
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,040
 You will receive power when the Holy Spirit

714
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,560
 has come upon you and, and you will be my witnesses

715
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,640
 in Jerusalem, in Judea and Samaria

716
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,560
 and the ends of the earth.

717
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,800
 You will be my witnesses in Hong Kong, Kowloon,

718
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,520
 new territories, China and the ends of the earth.

719
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,480
 Here I'm writing a new version for you.

720
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,160
 The power of the Spirit at work in the church

721
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,520
 and the world and being witnesses.

722
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,040
 Let's go back to Luke.

723
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,080
 Luke wrote a two volume work.

724
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,640
 It was Luke's gospel and the book of Acts.

725
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,780
 The story of Jesus, Luke's gospel was not complete.

726
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:53,020
 The story of Jesus called for and demanded a volume two,

727
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,640
 which Luke accordingly writes.

728
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,080
 Luke recognised that the story of Jesus was incomplete.

729
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,400
 It pointed forward and demanded the church.

730
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,240
 And just as the story of Jesus called for a volume two,

731
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:19,320
 so it calls for a volume three and Acts 29

732
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:25,000
 and a very, very, very long volume three,

733
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,620
 a very, very long chapter.

734
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:32,420
 The way that Luke ends Acts makes it very clear.

735
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,080
 Acts 29 is to be a chapter that echoes the story of Jesus,

736
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,080
 a chapter similarly empowered by the Spirit

737
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,560
 to be witnesses to Jesus to the ends of the earth.

738
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,360
 A chapter where we live out the reality

739
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,820
 that despite the worst that can happen,

740
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:00,140
 God's Word progresses, God's power sets people free

741
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,840
 and God's love transforms communities.

742
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,400
 Church, the book of Acts is an unfinished book.

743
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,440
 It has never been completed.

744
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,400
 It suddenly ends.

745
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,680
 Luke does not even write finish at the end.

746
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,980
 He leaves it there.

747
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,400
 He never gets back to it because of course,

748
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,720
 the Holy Spirit intended it to be unfinished.

749
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,080
 It is still being written.

750
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:42,140
 The book of Acts is the book of the record of the things

751
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,640
 which Jesus began both to do and teach.

752
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,800
 Is he through yet?

753
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,400
 No.

754
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,440
 He's still working, isn't he?

755
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:59,460
 Acts 29 is now being written.

756
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,180
 Being written, yeah.

757
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:06,740
 Acts 29 is now being written.

758
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,500
 When this great book is completed

759
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,940
 and in glory, you and I get to read it,

760
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,000
 I just wonder,

761
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,020
 what will be your part in it?

762
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,580
 As the band comes back, I'm gonna ask you to stand.

763
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,880
 I'd like to pray for you.

764
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,200
 Can everybody stand?

765
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,320
 If you're watching at home, you can stand if you like.

766
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,500
 If you're riding the MTR, it might be difficult.

767
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,140
 I don't know, but I want you at home to feel part of this.

768
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,300
 My friends, if you feel comfortable,

769
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,500
 either here or online,

770
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,740
 can you just stretch your hands out in front of you?

771
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,320
 (gentle music)

772
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,700
 The Holy Spirit is here today.

773
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:07,000
 The Holy Spirit wants to fill you.

774
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 He doesn't wanna fill you so you feel good about yourself

775
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,680
 or feel good about church.

776
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,140
 He wants to fill you because there's a job for you to do.

777
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,260
 Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, ends of the earth.

778
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,660
 Where's your Jerusalem?

779
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,020
 It might be your family or the people you work with,

780
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,860
 people that you see daily.

781
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:44,840
 Where's your Judea and Samaria?

782
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,820
 Might be the lady outside the Vine Center

783
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,600
 who's collecting rubbish,

784
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,940
 just needs someone to give her encouraging words.

785
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,800
 Where's your Judea?

786
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,460
 Where's your ends of the earth?

787
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,060
 Carla already mentioned there's lots of opportunities

788
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,180
 for our mission organizations this summer.

789
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:10,420
 Rather than just let that go by,

790
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,980
 could that be you who steps out from your desk

791
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,980
 and your comfort zone to fulfill the Great Commission?

792
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,120
 You can't do this on your own.

793
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,560
 You need the Holy Spirit.

794
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,900
 You don't need a little bit of the Holy Spirit.

795
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,340
 You know, I went to church today,

796
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,960
 yeah, there was a lot of Holy Spirit there.

797
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,060
 You need to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

798
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,440
 And actually to be filled with the Holy Spirit,

799
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,240
 you need to be emptied of yourself.

800
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,300
 Many of us do.

801
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,940
 We're too full of ourselves.

802
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,820
 So just take this time as you put your hands out

803
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,880
 to empty yourself.

804
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:06,140
 And Father, we ask that you would come to your church,

805
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:10,820
 here in this building, online, wherever people are listening,

806
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,400
 and fill us once again with your Holy Spirit.

807
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,000
 We need you.

808
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,440
 We need you desperately.

809
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,020
 (gentle music)

810
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:30,000
 Do you realize 94% of people in Hong Kong are not Christian?

811
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,680
 They need you to be filled with the Holy Spirit today,

812
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,040
 so the 6% can reach the 94%.

813
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,620
 (gentle music)

814
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:48,200
 Do you recognize the worldview around the world

815
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,320
 is going decidedly non-Christian?

816
00:48:52,320 --> 00:49:00,440
 They need Christians who will be full of the Holy Spirit,

817
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,240
 who will speak up for the gospel.

818
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:09,760
 You might be saying, "Hey, look, it's not me."

819
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,080
 You know, I understand, John,

820
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,760
 how you'd talk to the taxi driver

821
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,160
 and the guy on the bus, you'd talk to anybody,

822
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,500
 but that's just not me.

823
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,120
 Guys, it's not an option.

824
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,060
 It is you.

825
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,280
 There are people in your workplace.

826
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,880
 There are people in your family.

827
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,760
 There are people in your circle

828
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,940
 that God has ordained you to speak to.

829
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:43,360
 It might start off by you just doing

830
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,380
 a random act of kindness for them.

831
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,560
 (gentle music)

832
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,300
 And being able to follow up that,

833
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,020
 "Yes, I was able to do this because I'm a Christian."

834
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:59,400
 Can I pray for you?

835
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:07,820
 Do you know, I've lived in Hong Kong 35 years,

836
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:12,820
 and I've asked the question, "Can I pray for you?"

837
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,260
 I don't know how many times.

838
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:22,660
 I cannot remember somebody in Hong Kong saying no.

839
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:30,020
 I actually remember three years ago, I was in Jerusalem,

840
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,900
 I asked somebody if I could pray for him,

841
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,740
 and he actually said no.

842
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,940
 I was taken aback.

843
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,260
 It was the first time that had happened for a while.

844
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,340
 You can pray for people.

845
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,680
 You can minister to them.

846
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,640
 You can show Christ love.

847
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,220
 (gentle music)

848
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:53,020
 We need the Holy Spirit for the people of Yuen Long.

849
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:57,200
 It's no point us going to Yuen Long

850
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,060
 with a great plan for a church plant.

851
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:04,060
 We need the Holy Spirit.

852
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:10,560
 Let's just wait on Him.

853
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,840
 Allow Him to fill you afresh.

854
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,780
 Worship Him in your hearts.

855
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:28,220
 Come Holy Spirit.

856
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:33,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

857
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,820
 (gentle music)

858
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,400
 (gentle music)
