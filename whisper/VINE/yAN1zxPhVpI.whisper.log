[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   So recently I was invited to speak at the annual retreat of a large international nonprofit organization.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.360]   I was honored to be invited.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.120]   I was so excited to gather with this group of people overseas and take them through what I sense God had put on my heart.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.720]   I was invited to be the only speaker of the retreat.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.040]   It was over four days.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.000]   There were six main sessions that I was to bring content into.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.040]   And I remember being pretty nervous.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.240]   It was one of my first times to be overseas and speak.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.640]   And I was just really so prepared to bring what I sense God had put on my heart and felt so deeply honored to be able to do this for this group of people.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.920]   And I remember sitting there in the very first session.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.280]   I'm sitting on the front row.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.840]   I'm going through my notes.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.800]   I'm drastically trying to build the confidence in my heart to stand in front of this room that's packed full of all these people.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.760]   And the CEO of the organization, he gets up onto the platform to introduce me, to welcome me to the conference.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.080]   And here's what he says.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.960]   He goes, "Unfortunately, the person that I really wanted to be here to speak at this retreat couldn't make it this year.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.720]   So I'm grateful that Pastor Andrew Gardner from the Vine Church in Hong Kong can be with us today."
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.480]   I mean, can you imagine it, right?
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:26.080]   I'm sitting there and I've been introduced in lots of different ways throughout some 20 years of preaching, but I've never been introduced as the clear second choice.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.600]   And so I'm sitting there and all that inspiration and all that hope and encouragement is just drained from me.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.640]   I'm suddenly feeling like I'm weighing like 400 kilograms.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.400]   I like trudge up to the platform for my opening speech and I get in front of all these people.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.040]   And here's what comes out of my mouth.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.360]   I say, "Hey, everyone, I'm plan B.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.280]   No one likes to be second A.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.560]   I mean, none of us train hard for the silver medal, right?
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.320]   Like second is the great amnesia of history.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.720]   No one ever remembers who didn't win the prize, who didn't get the cup, who wasn't the one who actually succeeded.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.400]   The reason why we don't like second is because second reminds us that somebody else did better.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.240]   Somebody else performed more.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.760]   Somebody else was more desired than us.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.520]   When we're in second, it hurts our ego.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.000]   It hurts who we are.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.840]   And it's an uncomfortable place to be.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.040]   And so I think as humanity, we do everything we can to try to avoid the nastiness of being in second place.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.000]   The reality is, I think we do this in our churches.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.640]   I think so much of the Christian faith is so often from the pulpit shaped around this idea that as Christians, we never have to worry about second place.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.320]   No, as Christians, we get to be first, don't we?
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yes, we do.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.200]   We're victorious.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.800]   We're the overcomers.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.560]   Oh, we use words like we're the chosen and we get to go to heaven, the ultimate first place prize.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:07.360]   And the reality is when we push ourselves into this idea that we should be in first place, we actually have to stop for a second and realize that we completely missed the point of Christianity.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.360]   But yes, it's true.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.320]   As Christians, we will be victorious.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.880]   We will rise again.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.600]   We will be at some point with our heavenly father.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.720]   Those things are amazing.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.440]   They're the great promises of our faith.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.560]   But here's the irony and the beauty of the Christian faith.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.760]   We actually win by losing.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:40.800]   We actually win by actually being way second place, by giving up ourselves, by laying our crowns down, by actually picking up our cross and denying ourselves.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.360]   You will never get to where God wants you with a desire to be in first place.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.480]   Here's the reality.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.000]   First place has always been and will always be reserved for Jesus.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.520]   He is the one who is victorious.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.040]   He is first.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.280]   We are second.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.680]   See, this desire to be first has always been the antithesis of the gospel.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.520]   It's a desire that kicked Satan out of heaven.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.480]   It's one of the temptations that Satan brings Jesus in the wilderness.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.760]   The desire to be first overcame the disciples as Jesus gained in popularity.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.520]   And they said to him, "Who's going to sit at your right hand and sit at your left hand in glory?"
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.960]   The desire to be first, I think, has crushed the global church over almost 2000 years of history.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.400]   And it's created so many problems in leadership.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.600]   And here's the reality.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.760]   Here's the reason why.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.240]   The attributes of first are things like glory and power and authority and worship.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.160]   Things that are rightly for Jesus.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.320]   And here's the thing.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:05:01.920]   As humanity places itself in a position of first, when we try to grab a hold of attributes like power and authority and glory, we get so easily seduced by them.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.520]   They corrupt us.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.360]   They corrupt our hearts because these are attributes that are reserved for Jesus.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.040]   The desire for first is the antithesis of the gospel.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.480]   The desire to be second is fitting and deserving of it.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.120]   Because the idea of being second is the idea of some of the great themes that we see in the gospels.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.520]   The idea of humility.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.880]   The idea of honesty.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.840]   The idea of serving the other.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.560]   The idea of loving your neighbor as yourself.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.640]   The idea of realizing that there is somebody else who is as important, more important, more needful, more anointed.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.120]   That somebody else gets my life.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.200]   I can pour myself out towards them.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.280]   Christmas is the celebration that humanity gets to be second.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.640]   Because Christmas is all about the idea that Jesus comes.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.600]   That Jesus himself comes to model and to demonstrate what the Christian life looks like.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.960]   As we look at the beauty of the birth of Jesus.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.680]   I love how the apostle Paul brings it to us in Philippians chapter 2.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:17.040]   Paul says this, that even Jesus, the rightful one to be first, didn't hold being equal with God something to be grasped.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.320]   But instead, Jesus humbled himself.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.520]   That Jesus came in the incarnation as a human.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.640]   That he was willing to take off that power and that authority and lay it down.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.080]   Why?
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.000]   So he could serve us.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.440]   And what Jesus does in his life, in his death, in his resurrection, is models for us what it is to be in that place of second.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.640]   Everything Jesus did was to honor the reality of where we are to be.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:55.560]   And it blows my mind that the one who should be first chose the posture of being second to lead us out of the desire to be first into a place of second.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.680]   So that he could be truly glorified.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.040]   I hope you're following that.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.040]   Let me say it this way.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.920]   One of the beautiful ways that I think Jesus models to us what it is to be in second place.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.080]   Is that Jesus shows us what it is to be a follower.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.040]   A follower is the beauty of second place.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.280]   Jesus, throughout his ministry, would say this.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.960]   He says, "I can't say anything unless my father tells me to say it.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.120]   I won't go anywhere unless my father leads me there."
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:36.040]   Jesus's whole ministry was about listening to his father and being obedient to what his father was saying.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.560]   Because he was humbling, modeling something of what it is to be a follower.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.800]   And this is so beautiful.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.400]   It's Jesus consciously and deliberately demonstrated to us the art of what it is to be a follower.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.240]   And I call it an art because it's not a science.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.160]   Following after something is an art.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.120]   It's an expression of creativity.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.080]   It's individual.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.480]   It fills our own experience.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.040]   Following someone takes practice.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.680]   It's a sacrifice in order to do so.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.560]   We have to constantly fight that ego and that pride that would want to put us in front.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:17.360]   Being a follower enables us to put Jesus in that rightful place.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:24.920]   The beauty of being able to do that establishes for us something of the centrality of the kingdom of God.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:32.280]   That the foundation of everything we do comes from the idea that we get to follow Jesus.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.560]   You know, I always think of it this way.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.120]   I think following is like the undercoat of the kingdom of God.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.680]   It's like that first piece that's put on that canvas by an artist.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.160]   And he's going to paint over it many, many times.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:54.400]   But the ultimate color at the end only shines so deep and so beautiful because of the undercoat that was first placed on the canvas.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:01.480]   Our following, our welcome into what it is to follow Jesus is the undercoat of God's kingdom.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.720]   It's the foundation of everything.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.960]   And it's exactly what John the Baptist does in the final movement of his ministry.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.120]   We trace these movements that he's been doing throughout our Advent time.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.720]   We've looked at that first movement of calling people to repentance.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.120]   The second movement of welcoming them to the desert place where they could meet with God.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.000]   The third movement, as we saw last week, of being invited into the waters of baptism.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.440]   And the ultimate experience of the washing of the Holy Spirit in the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.000]   And now, right at the end of his life, right towards the end of his ministry, John does the final thing.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.480]   He releases the crowds to follow Jesus.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.760]   John ultimately says, "I must decrease, He must increase."
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:01.200]   Advent, if it's anything, is about the idea of preparing ourselves to truly follow Jesus.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.320]   And I want to show you some ways in which I think John invites us into being followers of Jesus today.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.440]   And you may have been a follower of Christ for many years.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.240]   Maybe like me, you've been a follower of Christ since you were pretty young.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.400]   Or maybe this is a new experience for you.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:25.440]   Wherever we are, I think so often we end up finding ourselves slipping back into the centrality of the world.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.360]   Where we become the focus.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.080]   And Jesus is like this deity on the shelf that we turn to in times of need.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.000]   May I challenge you today that we need to learn what it is to follow Jesus again.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.200]   Let me read this to us from John chapter 1.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.640]   I'm going to start in verse 29.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.560]   "The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.520]   And he said this, 'Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.600]   This is the one I meant when I said,
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.400]   'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.840]   I myself did not know him.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   But the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.'
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.400]   Then John gave this testimony.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.720]   'I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.920]   I would not have known him except for the fact that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me this,
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:24.160]   'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.920]   So I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God."
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.840]   Take a moment to think about the context here.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.960]   This is just probably a day or two after John has actually baptized Jesus in the Jordan River.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.480]   That baptism has taken place.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.280]   And now John realizes that the final movement of his ministry
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.640]   is to try to release all the disciples that had gathered around him.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.800]   Because John had become popular.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.960]   John's message had gone out to the people.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.760]   They were excited that the Messiah was about to come.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.960]   And here's John now saying, "Okay, I don't need all of this.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.280]   I'm not to be in that place of first.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.800]   If you're following me, you're in trouble.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.560]   No, no, I need to release you."
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.320]   And so as he sees Jesus walk past on this one day,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.680]   he shouts out with his whole voice in front of all these people.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   "Look, look, there's the Lamb of God.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.040]   Like right here.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.080]   This is the one who's going to take away the sins of the world.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.520]   I'm not that one.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.400]   This is the one."
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.680]   I love this.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.320]   He says, "Look, there is the Lamb of God."
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.760]   Now that phrase, the Lamb of God, it's actually only used here in John's ministry
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.280]   and also in the book of Revelation.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.560]   But it's actually not very prominent in the New Testament as a whole.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.960]   And the question we should ask ourselves is,
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.040]   why is John using that particular phrase in this moment?
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.560]   Well, he's drawing from beautiful Old Testament imagery.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.440]   The whole imagery of the Passover.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.840]   In the Passover, where they slaughtered the lambs
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.360]   and the Jewish people who were enslaved in Egypt
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.280]   took the blood from the lambs and put it on their doorposts on their walls
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.480]   so that the angel of death would not come across their door
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.600]   so that anybody in that household would be protected.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.280]   And here's John, how many years later,
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.040]   and he's pointing at Jesus and he's saying,
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.520]   "This is the new Passover right here.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.240]   This is the one whose blood will need to be shed."
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.840]   By calling him the Lamb of God, right at the start of Jesus's ministry,
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.000]   John is declaring that he's going to die.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.760]   I mean, that's what lambs were for.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.480]   They were for sacrifice to be slaughtered.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.440]   And here's John saying, "This is the one who's going to be slaughtered
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.640]   so that all of the sins of the world will be forgiven.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.640]   No longer would it just be blood over the walls and the doors for the Jewish people."
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.960]   Notice, he says, "For all the world."
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.120]   Like everybody, Jews and Gentiles alike will come to have their sins forgiven
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.720]   because of this one.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.240]   Look, there is the Lamb of God.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.400]   And I think that's so powerful and so beautiful
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.200]   that we can remember that he forgives our sins,
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.760]   that he can release these things from us,
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.520]   that we get to follow him.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.400]   And John says in verse 30, he says it this way.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.640]   He goes, "This is the one that I meant when I said,
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.160]   'A man comes after me who has surpassed me because he was before me.'"
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.240]   This is classic John.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.280]   I mean, imagine if you said that,
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.360]   "This is the one who's after me before me because he was before me."
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.120]   Like, this doesn't make sense.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.480]   Like, what are you talking about, John?
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.320]   This is like, you can imagine his disciples going like,
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.000]   "Did he eat too many locusts today?"
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.600]   Like, dude, chill out.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.200]   Like, what you, I don't get what's going on right now, right?
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.600]   Here's what John's saying.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.360]   He's saying, "Jesus is first always.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.120]   He was before me.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.120]   He's going to be after me.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.240]   He surpasses me.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.960]   I get to be a follower of the Lamb of God,
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.840]   the one who forgives my sin."
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.320]   This one right here.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.680]   Jesus' ministry was to point out the Lamb of God,
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.320]   to show people the way to Jesus.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.120]   And I don't know about you,
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.520]   but I find that incredibly challenging at this time of the year.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.280]   As I see Christmas just coming up on Friday of this week,
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.160]   I'm thinking to myself,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.480]   "Am I pointing people towards Jesus?"
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.760]   Like, does my life, the things I say, the way I act, who I am,
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.000]   does it make space for the reality
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.160]   where I'm trying to lead my sphere of influence
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.640]   to the place where their sins can be forgiven?
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.080]   Am I an evangelist?
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.040]   Am I pointing out to people that this is the Lamb of God?
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.560]   This is deeply challenging,
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.480]   'cause I want to be honest about it.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.800]   I think so often as Christians,
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.320]   we might have this idea that Jesus is the Lamb of God,
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.720]   but we're not really pointing towards him.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.920]   In fact, most of our lives are actually pointing
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.960]   in the opposite direction.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.120]   Rather than saying, "Look, the Lamb of God."
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   Here's what I think we often end up saying,
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.600]   "Look, the servant of God."
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.840]   And we put ourselves once again in that first place.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.680]   If Advent is anything,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.560]   if Advent is this call to us
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.960]   to prepare ourselves for the coming of Jesus,
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.680]   both individually and as a community,
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.200]   we must ask ourselves, "Who are we pointing towards?
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.720]   Who is getting my focus?"
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.480]   And I wanna invite you to reflect on that right here
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   in the middle of this message.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.840]   I want you to take a moment now to ask yourself,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.680]   "Is my life really pointing to Jesus?
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.120]   I mean, is he really my focus point right now?
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.760]   Or am I actually kind of pointing towards myself?
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.920]   Or I'm pointing towards my career?
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.080]   Or I'm pointing towards this job that I have?
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.400]   Or I'm pointing towards something else in my life?
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.800]   Or I'm pointing towards my social media that's about me?
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.480]   I'm pointing, whatever it might be,
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.240]   we find ourselves pointing in lots of different directions.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   But are we releasing people through our lifestyle,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.360]   through our words and our actions and our voice?
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.480]   Are we releasing people to follow the Lamb of God?
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.320]   Or are we inviting people to celebrate the servant of God?
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.320]   May I open your hearts to this thought right now.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.080]   And the way we're gonna do that is in a moment,
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.360]   I'm just gonna invite the worship team.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.840]   They're gonna come and actually lead us in a song.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   And this song won't be too familiar to you.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.720]   It'll probably be new.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.800]   And I wanna encourage you to read the lyrics.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.360]   It's a song that celebrates this power
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.280]   that is in the name of Jesus.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.840]   This idea of the King being kings,
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.160]   that he is one that's seated on the throne.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.240]   It's a song that celebrates pointing to the Lamb of God.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.440]   And so as you reflect on this,
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.480]   as you listen to the song,
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.680]   as you allow the lyrics to take heart in yourself,
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.840]   allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.840]   And if there's any way that he shows you
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.080]   that you haven't been pointing in the right direction,
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.120]   just in the beautiful kindness of his presence,
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.400]   bring it to him.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.600]   And after we finish this song,
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.720]   I'm gonna come back to us
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.160]   and I'm gonna show us what happens
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.280]   in the rest of the story.

[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.760]   Let's take a look at what happens next in our story
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.400]   as John continues to release people to Jesus.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.360]   I'm gonna pick it up in verse 35.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.920]   "The next day, John was there again with two of his disciples.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.600]   When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, 'Look, the Lamb of God!'
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.240]   When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.800]   Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, 'What is it that you want?'
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.600]   They said, 'Rabbi,'" which means teacher,
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.440]   "'Where are you staying?'
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.320]   'Come,' he replied, 'and you will see.'
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.680]   So they went and saw where he was staying and spent that day with him.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.040]   It was about the 10th hour."
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.120]   I love this.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.680]   This is the next moment in the narrative.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.520]   And it says right again, "The next day,"
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.040]   so immediately after what we had just been talking about before,
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.840]   here's John and he sees Jesus again in the crowds.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.440]   And he once again shouts out and points out, "Here is the Lamb of God!"
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.320]   But something different takes place this time.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.800]   Two, just two, but two of John's disciples
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.320]   who'd been with John the whole time,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.800]   who had seen John and admired John
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.720]   and modeled their lives after John,
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.080]   who had followed him,
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.520]   are then aware that this one is the Lamb of God,
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.240]   that this one is the one who is about to take the sin from the world.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.800]   And so they leave John and they begin to walk in his direction.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.200]   They begin to come towards him, to follow after him.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.280]   And it seems like such a small thing in the text,
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.200]   but it actually is so much.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.240]   It's actually so powerful.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.080]   These are the first two disciples of Jesus.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.680]   And it challenges me because here's the thought.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.520]   See, I think we can very easily be people
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.640]   who can point out that Jesus is the Lamb of God
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.920]   and yet fail to actually follow him ourselves.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.400]   I think one of the dangers of the church,
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.440]   I'm gonna be really honest,
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.120]   I think one of the dangers of the church
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.640]   is that we can be filled with people who sing about the Lamb of God
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.080]   and yet fail to truly follow him.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.720]   And what can end up happening,
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.600]   particularly I would say in a church like the Vine sometimes,
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.600]   is that people can end up following a brand,
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.200]   following a church,
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.720]   following a speaker or a leader,
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.440]   and not actually following Jesus.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.560]   If there's something we are completely about here at the Vine
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.920]   is that we must decrease, he must increase.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.400]   That we must be less, he must be more.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.160]   That is the whole beauty of the Christmas story,
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.480]   that in the incarnation one comes,
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.800]   who takes that power and authority
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.520]   and all the thing that can seduce and corrupt us
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.360]   and brings it to someone else,
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.720]   where we can stand back and go,
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.800]   "There's the Lamb of God,"
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.640]   and actually follow him,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.960]   be released to give our lives to him.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.040]   I mean, what a joy that is.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.000]   What a gift that, my friends, is the heart of the gospel.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.160]   Notice what happens when we follow after Jesus.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.720]   It says in verse 38,
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.760]   "Turning around, Jesus saw them following him,
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.920]   and he asked them, 'What do you want?'"
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.680]   I love this.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.440]   This is classic Jesus, right?
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.240]   So there's Jesus just going about his normal day, right?
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.320]   And he's got a couple of dudes following him now.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.520]   And he's like, "Have you ever been in like Ikea?"
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.560]   I've done this many times.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.200]   It drives me nuts.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.280]   You're in Ikea, there's hundreds of people around you,
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.800]   and you're walking and you turn left,
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.160]   and then some people turn left with you,
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.800]   and you turn right,
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.920]   and some people turn right with you,
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.960]   and you want to turn around and go,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.000]   "What do you want?"
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.880]   Like, "What's going on?"
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.200]   This is like the classic Hong Kong crowd thing.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.560]   Here's Jesus.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.280]   Got two people for the first time following him.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.080]   And he turns around.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.560]   When you read it in English, it's like almost Jesus is like,
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.120]   "What do you want? Why are you following me?"
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.440]   It's beautiful.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.520]   Actually, in the Greek, if you read it, it says it more like this.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.280]   "What is on your heart?"
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.040]   Isn't that cool?
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.560]   Like in the English, it's like, "What do you want?"
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.600]   But in the Greek, it's more, "What is on your heart?"
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.520]   In other words, Jesus turns to these two people,
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.960]   and he says, "Why are you following me?
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.400]   What is your desire?
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.080]   What are you trying to seek?
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.800]   What is ultimately in your heart?"
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.520]   It's a powerful question.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.320]   It welcomes us into a different place.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.520]   It reminds us that following Jesus
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.760]   is not about Jesus walking ahead of us,
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.800]   and us just trying to diligently kind of walk in his footsteps,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.040]   like we're trying to be perfect like Jesus.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.480]   Following Jesus is a relationship.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.080]   Following Jesus is a dialogue.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.200]   It's a community.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.040]   It's a chance to actually commune with the creator of all things.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.040]   When we follow Jesus, we're not distant to him,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   trying to keep up with him.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.840]   We're walking alongside with him.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.800]   In fact, actually, the Greek word for following here
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.360]   means actually to journey on a path
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.000]   or to go on a path with someone.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.840]   So you're walking almost alongside of Jesus.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.720]   And there's this kind of dialogue that you're having with him.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.480]   That's the beauty and the simplicity of what it is to follow Jesus.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.160]   If you want to know just basically what does it mean to follow Jesus,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.160]   it means to live your life in dialogue with the creator of the universe,
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.040]   to have a conversation with him,
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.240]   to listen to him, to hear him, to ask of him.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.720]   And here are these two disciples that Jesus turns to in this moment,
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.880]   and he says, "What is on your heart?"
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.160]   Imagine if Jesus turned to you right now and said those words to you.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.680]   What is on your heart?
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.560]   How would you respond?
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.280]   Maybe you might say, "All right, yeah, I've got a question for you, God.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.640]   I want to ask you, why is it that bad people always seem to get the good stuff?"
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.600]   Or maybe you might ask, "Yeah, God, why is it that when I pray sometimes,
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.760]   it feels like my prayers don't get unanswered?"
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.960]   Or maybe you'd want to ask, "Why does bad stuff happen to good people?"
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.480]   You know, like there's a whole bunch of questions that we might have on our hearts.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.800]   If God turned to us and said, "What is on your heart?"
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.720]   And I want you to hear what these two disciples respond with.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.440]   Could have asked anything of the creator of the universe.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.320]   Here's what they say.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:43.280]   In verse 38, they say this, they say, "Rabbi," which means teacher, "Where are you staying?"
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.280]   Like, where are you staying today?
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.160]   Because we want to come and be with you.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.360]   We want to just spend our time with you.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.280]   We want to sit in your presence.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.800]   We want to be with you.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.520]   If you want to know what following Jesus essentially is, it is exactly that.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:07.120]   It is discovering where Jesus is in your life and spending time with him.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:13.920]   Just desiring to be present with him, wanting to walk side by side with him,
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.400]   wanting to be in the very places in our city where he is.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.800]   The invitation of their hearts is to say, "You're the lamb of God.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.360]   You're the one who's going to take the sin away from the world.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.360]   You're the one who's rightfully first.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.960]   All power and authority and majesty and glory is yours.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.720]   We just want to be with you."
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:38.400]   That heart cry of being a follower of Jesus is as simple as that.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.520]   You don't have to be learned.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.880]   You don't have to be excellent.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.160]   You don't have to be perfect.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.560]   You just have to carry that desire that says, "God, I just want to be with you.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.440]   I want to know you.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.240]   I want to hear you.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.240]   I want to sense your presence with me.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.120]   I want to see what it is that you're up to.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.720]   Would you lead?
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.240]   I want to follow.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.680]   Would you reveal?
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.520]   I want to see.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.480]   Would you tell me?
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.920]   Because I want to learn."
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:07.440]   It's a dialogue and a community with the creator of the world.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.520]   I mean, what could be better than that?
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.960]   And I love how Jesus responds to them.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.760]   He says this.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.840]   He says, "Come," He replied, "and you will see."
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.920]   Think about this for a sec.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.240]   What is on your heart?
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.640]   We want to know where you're staying.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.240]   You want to be with me?
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.280]   Come then, and you will see.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:37.200]   Jesus invites them to not only be with Him, but to see the things that He is about to do.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.320]   And I think this is so profound.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:46.240]   If there is a sentence that sums up all of Advent, where Advent is about the idea that
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:52.160]   I get to come to be with Jesus, that I get to come to prepare myself for the coming of Jesus.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.440]   That's what Advent is all about.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.760]   Here's Jesus turning Advent around, and He's saying, "You know what Advent is for Him?
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.120]   It's for Him to say, 'Come to me.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.680]   You come to me, and I will show you what I'm up to.'"
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:09.920]   Jesus stands over your workplace, and He says, "Come, and you will see."
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:16.080]   He stands over your marriage, and He says, "Come, and you will see."
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.760]   He stands over those relationships that are broken in your life right now, and He's saying,
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.680]   "Come, and you will see."
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:31.120]   He stands over your pain and your hurt of 2020, and He says, "Come, and you will see."
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:37.760]   He's present in the worst places, in the places that are the hardest to find.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:43.600]   He's present in every aspect of our city, and He's crying out to us, and He's saying,
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   "Come, and you will see.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:50.880]   I will show you what I'm doing in all the places where you thought I was absent.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.520]   Emmanuel, God with us."
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.080]   This is the Christmas message church.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.760]   This is the shepherds in the fields hearing the angels say, "Come, and you will see."
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:08.000]   This is the magi wondering what is ahead of them, following a star that's telling them,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.840]   "Come, and you will see."
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:16.640]   Christmas is the manger that says to the world, "Come, and you will see."
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:24.240]   Where is it in your life that you want to see the activity of Jesus?
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.280]   You're called not for first place.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.840]   You're called not to increase, but decrease.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:38.960]   You're called to that great and glorious gift of following after Jesus,
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.800]   and in doing so, being in dialogue and community with Him,
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:50.640]   wondering in your heart where He is, and then in the miracle of faith, seeing Him show it to you.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.800]   Him saying those words, "Come, and you will see."
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.520]   Where for you do those words resonate most today?
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.680]   Where as you prepare your heart for Christmas on Friday,
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.880]   are you longing to see Jesus the most?
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.120]   That's what I encourage you to bring your prayer to today.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.960]   As we finish our time in this series, as we finish Advent,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:19.360]   as we get ready to celebrate Jesus's birth on Christmas day,
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:25.040]   we do so from that posture of following after Him, hungry to see Him,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:33.040]   revealed more in Christmas in 2020 than He has ever been in any time of history.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.880]   Maranatha, come Lord Jesus.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.960]   Let me pray for us.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.520]   Let's pray.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:44.160]   Father, for whoever is listening to this right now,
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.880]   where this is a word in season for them,
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.400]   maybe some who are listening have put themselves in the place of first,
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.320]   where they've been saying more, "Look the servant of God,"
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.240]   rather than, "Look the Lamb of God."
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.760]   Lord, if that's the reality for any of us,
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.360]   thank you that we can bring that to you in this moment.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.240]   Thank you that you love us, you forgive us, and you release us, Lord.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.720]   And so we come in that place of repentance as we've spoken about every week.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.920]   We ask you now to wash us clean again, Lord.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.040]   If we've allowed ego and pride to center the universe around ourselves,
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.160]   would you forgive us, Lord?
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.160]   And may we take on that mantle of John the Baptist today.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.600]   And may our lives point people to seeing Jesus.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.200]   May we decrease, may Jesus increase.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.640]   Or maybe you've been listening to this today,
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.560]   and for you, in all of the things that have happened this year,
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.760]   and all the stuff,
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:50.720]   maybe you need to get that fire again in your heart that says to the Lord,
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.240]   "God, I want to follow you.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.000]   I want to just be where you are.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.480]   And I realize I've been distracted by so many things, but it's simple.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.040]   I just want to follow you, Lord.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.640]   I want to be in conversation with you.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.320]   I want to have dialogue with you again.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.560]   I want to hear your words spoken after me.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.280]   Show me where you are, Lord."
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:15.120]   And for some of you today, those words are a great encouragement to you.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.880]   Come and you will see.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.320]   And wherever it might be that you're looking for a breakthrough,
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.240]   wherever it might be that you're desiring for more of Him,
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.200]   hear the word spoken by the Spirit over you.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.200]   Come and you will see.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.440]   Lord Jesus, for anyone here who's listening to this right now,
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.680]   I want to pray that that would be a reality for them this Christmas.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.360]   That you would show them where you're staying in their businesses,
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.480]   in their marriages, in their families, in their relationships,
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.320]   in the places of healing they need,
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.280]   and all of the things that are going on that are stressing them.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.480]   Would you reveal the power of your glory to them?
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.280]   And would you show yourself new and afresh this Christmas?
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:05.360]   And we pray this together in Jesus' name, Amen.
