1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
 I'm one of the pastors here at the Vine.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,960
 If you're relatively new to the Vine, we're so glad that you're here.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,380
 Welcome to us.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,080
 This is the week that Coldplay is in Hong Kong.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
 Everybody's excited.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,800
 Some of you have tickets in this room.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,600
 Well done.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,280
 Some of you do not.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,280
 Well done.

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,920
 Whether you're going to see Coldplay or not, the Lord is here.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
 Amen.

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,280
 I've been sharing with you a number of times that one of the great highlights of walking

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,380
 the Camino de Santiago in the north of Spain, which is an 800 kilometer journey from south

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,560
 of France over to the west coast of Spain.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,800
 One of the great highlights I've been sharing with you is this idea that you get to visit

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,420
 these amazing cathedrals and these amazing churches as you're going on that pilgrimage

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,240
 and journey.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,520
 There are some spectacular cathedrals on the way of the Camino, particularly when you get

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,360
 to cities, major cities like Pamplona and Burgos and Leon and of course, Santiago de

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,760
 Compostela itself at the end.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,840
 The cathedrals in those cities are some of the most beautiful and sacred in the world.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,840
 And literally, there were a couple of times where I'd walked into those cathedrals and

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,240
 it was like such a moment.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,340
 When you think about for hundreds, thousands of years, people have gathered in those buildings

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,680
 to worship Jesus, just that reverence that comes and I was literally left breathless

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,560
 a number of times.

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,400
 But also along the way on the Camino, it's not just in the major cities where you get

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,200
 this incredible sense of these cathedrals, even in some of the smaller towns that you

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,120
 walk through over the 30, 40 days that you're walking, you see great churches, beautiful

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,720
 local village churches.

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,360
 You walk in there and those beautiful wooden pews, maybe it seats like 100 people, maybe

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,280
 80 to 100 people, beautiful paintings and iconography on the walls, a cross, candles

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
 lit everywhere.

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,440
 So you'd walk into some of these smaller churches but they were equally beautiful, equally profound,

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,200
 equally sacred.

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,920
 And then there was like a third category of church on the walk.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,440
 And that was when you're in like the really rural places, a little bit off the beaten

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,320
 path where the path of the Camino takes you, maybe into some farmland or somewhere like

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,480
 that and you come across these older churches and most of these are like they don't even

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
 operate anymore.

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,640
 They're just old church buildings.

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,880
 They're kind of run down looking.

43
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,920
 Maybe there's holes in the roof and maybe no one's kind of visited it for quite some

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
 time.

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
 And I actually was drawn to these kinds of churches.

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,440
 I loved to find the super rural, super run down, super broken down churches because I

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,160
 would often go into there and put my backpack down and spend some time in prayer and I'd

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,800
 be the only person there.

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,440
 And it'd be a place of complete solitude where no one else is there.

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,960
 And the Camino is famous for being quite social and there's lots going on as you walk the

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
 800 kilometers.

52
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,280
 And so those moments were precious to me where I would go into these broken down churches

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,520
 and just spend time with Jesus there.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,360
 Well about six or seven days before the end of the walk, so right towards the end of it,

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,600
 I was cresting up a hill one day on my own as I was walking and I noticed one of these

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,720
 run down little kind of old parish churches just sitting on the crest of this hill behind

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
 an old stone wall.

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,920
 It looked pretty run down, it looked pretty derelict.

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,000
 I took a photo of it.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
 I want to show you the photo of it.

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,480
 There it is nestled in these trees on the top of this hill kind of out the way.

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,600
 And there was that stone wall you can kind of see at the bottom of the photo there.

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,280
 And I decided I wanted to go in and spend time there.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,680
 So I put my backpack down and I wasn't exactly sure.

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,960
 It wasn't obvious how to get around the stone wall.

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,080
 So I scrambled up the stone wall, walked in and then went through the door at the front

67
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,720
 there and walked into this chapel.

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,360
 And I was surprised by what I found in there.

69
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,040
 It was unlike any other church that I'd visited on the whole walk.

70
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,040
 It was completely barren on the inside.

71
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,320
 There was nothing, no paintings, no pews, no iconography.

72
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,120
 I took a photo of the inside.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,760
 This is what it looked like.

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,440
 It was just this run-down stone-based kind of maybe there was some life here at some

75
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
 point.

76
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,200
 Now it's just kind of like this.

77
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,920
 You could tell that it had been open to the elements for a while and there was mold and

78
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,000
 stuff everywhere.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,680
 It was super cold and dingy.

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,040
 I would have thought it was completely abandoned except for at the front there, you might be

81
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,720
 able to see in the photo, there was a little cross at the front behind the stone precipice.

82
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,840
 And there was a few burnt down candles there.

83
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
 They weren't currently lit.

84
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,000
 You could tell that somebody had been there in the reasonably recent time and had burnt

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,840
 some candles there.

86
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
 And so this was it.

87
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
 And it was a little bit creepy, if I'm perfectly honest.

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,800
 It was just a little bit like, "Oh gosh, this is kind of not too comfortable."

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,120
 So I spent about, I don't know, five minutes there just praying.

90
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
 And then I kind of left, picked up my backpack, started walking again.

91
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,640
 And I walked about another five kilometers.

92
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,200
 And by then I was kind of done with the day.

93
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,480
 I'd gotten to the village that I was going to settle in on that day.

94
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,200
 And I decided, I didn't do this every night, but I decided for this night, there was quite

95
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,720
 a famous church in this town that I was settling in.

96
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,000
 And the monks there offered for pilgrims for a very low price, I think it was about three

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,640
 or four euro, it wasn't very much at all, for a donation, you could sleep on the church

98
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
 floor.

99
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,160
 And I thought this would be great.

100
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,560
 I want to sleep on the church floor, kind of do it pretty rustic style.

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,040
 And as part of the donation that you make, you were then invited to a meal, an evening

102
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,280
 meal that the monks made for you, which I thought was going to be fun too.

103
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,240
 So I donated and I put out my kind of mat on the floor and the evening came and we sat

104
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,480
 down for this amazing meal that these monks made.

105
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,240
 And I was sitting next to this man and I got chatting with him.

106
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
 And it turns out that he was the priest.

107
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,640
 He was a local priest and he was the priest of the parish of that area.

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,120
 And I didn't tell him I was a pastor, but I thought this is fascinating.

109
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,360
 I'm talking to this priest who kind of oversees some churches in the area.

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,560
 And then I began to tell him about this church that I'd kind of visited earlier in the day

111
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,000
 and how I'd enjoyed it, but it was like abandoned and kind of creepy.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,440
 And I got my phone out and I showed him these two photos and he looked at it and his face

113
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
 like lit up.

114
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,440
 He's like, "Oh, that's my church."

115
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
 I said, "What?"

116
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
 He's like, "That's my church."

117
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,720
 He's like, "I'm the parish, a priest of that church."

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,480
 I'm like, "Really, this one?

119
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,960
 This is your church?"

120
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,160
 I'm like, "This abandoned, run down looking church.

121
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,840
 You're doing a really bad job of looking after your church.

122
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,000
 I just want to..."

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 I didn't say that.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Don't worry.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 I'm not going to say that.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
 And his face lit up and he's like, "Yeah, that's my church."

127
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,240
 And he was like, "I prepare a sermon every Sunday."

128
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,040
 And he said, "I walk with my dog the five kilometers to the church from where we are

129
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
 now."

130
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,000
 And he's like, and sometimes he's like, "Some Sundays revival comes and five people show

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 up."

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,360
 And he kind of like, his face was like, "Five people come."

133
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,560
 And then he says, "But most of the time it's just me and my dog.

134
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,400
 And on some Sundays my dog isn't even bothered to come.

135
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,960
 And it's literally just me," he said.

136
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,760
 And he's like, "I prepare a sermon every Sunday and I go there and if no one shows up, then

137
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
 I just pray.

138
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,280
 And if one person shows up, then I give my sermon and I do the priestly ritual and rites

139
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,240
 and then we pray together."

140
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,560
 He's like, "But most of the time no one shows up and I'm just there and I pray."

141
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,760
 And I thought to myself, I said to him, I said, "How long have you been serving this

142
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,040
 church?"

143
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,560
 And this was his honest response.

144
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,280
 He said, "Oh, not very long, just about 38 years."

145
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,680
 Thirty-eight years.

146
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,560
 Now I'm sure there had been seasons at some point for this man where maybe there was a

147
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
 little bit more activity in this church, but for whatever reason over the years, it had

148
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,320
 turned into this.

149
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,280
 A situation where he prepares a sermon each week, shows up and has no idea if anyone is

150
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,680
 actually going to show up.

151
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,240
 Well, our conversation kind of changed and went in different directions and we talked

152
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
 about other things.

153
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,520
 But I remember sleeping that night on the stone floor of this church thinking to myself

154
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
 this, "What a waste.

155
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
 What a waste.

156
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,680
 Like this guy's got gifts and he seemed like a really nice guy.

157
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
 He had a great sense of humor.

158
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,640
 I'm sure he's a good preacher, has a heart for people and a heart for Jesus.

159
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
 What a waste."

160
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,200
 I went to bed that night just going like, "This is kind of weird."

161
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
 I remember saying to myself, "I'm going to pray for this man.

162
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,120
 I'm going to pray that revival breaks out and more than five people come to his church."

163
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,680
 Like that would be the right thing to do, to pray for him.

164
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,240
 So the next morning we pack up our stuff and the monks say goodbye and I say goodbye to

165
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
 the priest.

166
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,760
 And I start to walk for my next day's walk on the Camino and I fell into prayer as I

167
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
 was doing each day.

168
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,840
 And as I fell into prayer, I immediately thought of this priest and my promise to pray.

169
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,720
 And so I begin to pray for him.

170
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,000
 And as soon as I begin to pray for him, have you ever had one of those moments where God

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,880
 shows up when you pray?

172
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
 Anyone had that?

173
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
 Like three people.

174
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 Great.

175
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,800
 Tip, when you pray, God shows up.

176
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,660
 So I'm praying, God shows up, and it's like one of those moments where he's like, he slaps

177
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,800
 you because he's got something to tell you off about, something to challenge you with.

178
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,280
 So I get one of these, like, "Come on, Andrew."

179
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,480
 And he starts to speak to me and convict me.

180
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,440
 I get my phone out and I'm sheepishly journaling kind of what he says to me.

181
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,160
 I want to read you what he said to me.

182
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
 I wrote it down on my phone.

183
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,520
 He said, "Andrew, you need to redefine what you think is successful in ministry and what

184
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,640
 is not.

185
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,680
 Your attitude is wrong and you're thinking flawed.

186
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,840
 I have not called you to be successful.

187
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,640
 I've called you to be faithful.

188
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,960
 And last night, I put beside you one of my favorite examples of this kind of success

189
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
 in my kingdom.

190
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,000
 You were fortunate to be in his presence."

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,320
 I honestly thought he was fortunate to be in my presence.

192
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,360
 That's my honest confession because I run a nice church where we have lots of people

193
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
 that come on a Sunday.

194
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,120
 And this guy, and I thought maybe I could give him some tips and tricks on how to grow

195
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,560
 your church.

196
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,480
 But I was the one who was fortunate to be in his presence.

197
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,600
 I think as we continue to think about what it is for God to call us as a church community

198
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,560
 into uncharted waters and an uncharted season that is ahead of us, I think one of the very

199
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,280
 first things we have to wrestle and grapple with is to completely redefine how we actually

200
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,840
 think about what success will look like in the season ahead.

201
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,480
 It's very easy for us to actually define success in worldly terms, to define what we think

202
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,340
 is successful in God's kingdom in certain ways.

203
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,600
 When we enter into an uncharted season, for example, our excitement might be that God's

204
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,600
 about to do something great, that God's about to do something marvelous and spectacular

205
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
 and amazing.

206
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,200
 It's going to be like the main cathedrals in Burgos and Leon.

207
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,960
 It's going to be awesome and huge and big.

208
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,960
 But actually, so often in God's kingdom, the worldly understanding of what success might

209
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:56,180
 look like, bigger is better, is not actually at all what success in the kingdom looks like.

210
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,040
 And as we begin to grapple with this, we have to begin to challenge ourselves with some

211
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,560
 changes now, a posture of heart now, or we're going to press on into a season like this.

212
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,640
 And because we're defining what we think God is doing, or we're defining what we think

213
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,480
 success will be for this season, whether communally for us as a church or individually for us,

214
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,800
 and God doesn't do it that way, we're going to walk away disappointed.

215
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,040
 Here's how I want to say it as clearly as I can.

216
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:31,520
 If we as a church here in Hong Kong are going to be people who are ready to act and respond

217
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,920
 as the Holy Spirit speaks, then we're going to need to release the pressure to succeed

218
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,080
 with the priority to be faithful.

219
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:47,840
 We're going to have to release that pressure to succeed with the priority to be faithful.

220
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,740
 To be faithful to the thing that God's called us to do, whether no one shows up or not.

221
00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:00,600
 To be faithful to the small, everyday, almost to us seems kind of mundane and ordinary,

222
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,520
 but it's the very thing that God has placed in our hands.

223
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:11,120
 As we stay faithful to what God has called us to do, we begin to shift how we think about

224
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,680
 what God is going to do next.

225
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:19,520
 You see, a definition for success in the kingdom is not found in the abundance of achievement,

226
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,560
 but in the faithfulness of obedience.

227
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,440
 Come on, church.

228
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,560
 What the Lord is calling us to when He calls us to a time of unchartedness is not a call

229
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,600
 to the outcome.

230
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,920
 Come on, church.

231
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,640
 It's not a call to the grand and the spectacular and some outcome.

232
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,680
 It's a call to faithfulness in the small thing.

233
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,440
 It's a call to a commitment to what He's already put in our hearts, a commitment to the thing

234
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,000
 that He might have called us to, which may seem to the world like a small and insignificant

235
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,920
 thing, but to Him, He's going, "Oh, you are fortunate to be in the presence of that one."

236
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,840
 You might remember at Vision Sunday, I shared this idea of the uncharted by giving us a

237
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,680
 picture of those early pioneer boats, right?

238
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,640
 Those early settlers that believed that there was land out there, but no one had ever been

239
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,720
 there before, and there was no map or charter to help them to get there, and it was uncharted

240
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,120
 waters for them.

241
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,600
 And yet they got the boat together and they got a crew together and they set out in hopes

242
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,480
 and excitement that they might find something out there.

243
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,800
 I shared on that Sunday the picture of that captain on the bow of the boat with his telescope

244
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,780
 looking out for the land, and the many people on the boat all had their individual parts

245
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,400
 to play to ensure that the boat was going in the direction that the captain wanted the

246
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,760
 boat to go in.

247
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,920
 And when God is calling us into a season of unchartedness, we have to realize that we're

248
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,780
 not the captain in the bow.

249
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,780
 We might like to be, but we're not the one who's the captain in the bow.

250
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,760
 That's Jesus Christ, and he's leading his church into uncharted waters.

251
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,000
 Our role is not with the telescope looking out beyond, our role is to get a hold of the

252
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,320
 rigging, to get a hold of the sails.

253
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,520
 Our role is to ensure that the ship, his church, his bride, is moving in the direction that

254
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,160
 the captain has called it to go.

255
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:27,760
 Miracled to the small thing, the small beautiful thing of serving the captain.

256
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,440
 Now what you need to understand is that there were many boats in those days that went out

257
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,760
 looking for distant lands.

258
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,000
 Because they didn't have maps, they had no idea how far those lands were.

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,800
 And maybe when they set out for harbor, they put two months worth of food and supplies

260
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,780
 on the boat, and when they get out there, they realize that there's a point of no return.

261
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,000
 We haven't found any land yet, we need to turn around now and go back, otherwise the

262
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,280
 supplies will run out and we're all basically going to die.

263
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,680
 And for every 10 boats that went out, nine of them returned having not found a thing.

264
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,360
 Could you imagine how it would have felt if you were a sailor on one of those boats?

265
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,000
 You had such high expectations and excitement, and yet you've come back without finding land,

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,360
 and they would have felt angry and frustrated, and, "Well, that was a waste of time.

267
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,320
 Why did we even bother to do that?

268
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,600
 There wasn't any fruit at all."

269
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,600
 And when God calls a community to uncharted waters, we have to realize that He doesn't

270
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,800
 promise us something spectacular.

271
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,580
 He doesn't promise us the abundance of all this achievement.

272
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,320
 The point of calling a church to uncharted waters is that He's calling us to faithfulness.

273
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,780
 He's saying literally, "You don't know what's out there, but that's not your concern.

274
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,840
 You're not to be worried about whether you're going to find land or not.

275
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
 It may happen.

276
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
 It may not happen.

277
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,640
 What I'm calling you is to follow after me.

278
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,200
 And if you're the chef below deck preparing the food, prepare the food.

279
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,440
 If you're the one on the deck that's preparing the rigging for the next time we put the sail

280
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,240
 up, prepare the rigging.

281
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,920
 Do the thing that is in your hand."

282
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,900
 And yet so often we desire to know what it is that is about to happen.

283
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:20,000
 We get so obsessed with the achievement and the outcome because we take what a worldly

284
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,920
 understanding of success is and we bring it into the church, we bring it into our Christian

285
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,240
 lives and we begin to say, "Well, unless we see a great outcome, then it's a complete

286
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
 waste of time."

287
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,040
 Like me going to sleep praying for that poor pastor because he's not seeing any fruit in

288
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,360
 his ministry and God coming and going, "You're thinking of it differently.

289
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,040
 You're thinking of it wrongly.

290
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,600
 You got to be very careful that we don't start this season of Uncharted thinking wrongly,

291
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,040
 that it's going to be about something spectacular."

292
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,840
 Look, there may be for some of us in this room spectacular things ahead, things that

293
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,960
 you never would have anticipated or expected.

294
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,620
 There might be for some of us these incredible testimonies of God doing miraculous things

295
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,000
 in our lives and we believe for that, we pray for that and we want that, of course.

296
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,200
 But here's the reality for many of us, actually what will be in this season is simply God

297
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,120
 looking to see whether we'd be willing to sacrifice and give and serve and press in

298
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,640
 to the thing that's already in our hand.

299
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,880
 It's interesting, when you look at the book of Acts, which is a fascinating thing to look

300
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,920
 at, and you look at how the early church grew and what the early church became.

301
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,500
 So often when we look at the book of Acts, we see the heroes of the book of Acts, people

302
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,280
 like the great apostles, like Peter and Paul and James and Barnabas and Silas and these

303
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,960
 other ones with a narrative that Luke is presenting for us in Acts of the growth of the early

304
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
 church.

305
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,780
 He's zeroing in on the spectacular things.

306
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,360
 He often zeroes in on these great moments when Peter literally heals somebody, where

307
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,160
 there's somebody raised from the dead, where even the handkerchiefs of Paul make the sick

308
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
 people well.

309
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,120
 It's easy when you read the book of Acts to think that actually the growth and the

310
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,720
 sustaining of the church was because of these super apostles, when actually if you dig just

311
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,200
 a little bit below the surface, the book of Acts presents to us the growth and the sustainability

312
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,120
 of the church, not because of these super apostles who did amazing things, but because

313
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:33,640
 of the everyday, almost unthought of, unknown, unnamed individuals who were day in, day

314
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,680
 out a part of that church.

315
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,560
 Not the ones that went out and did amazing things, but the ones that remained in the

316
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,200
 cities and the towns and showed up each week.

317
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,880
 The code of faithfulness is not a sexy thing.

318
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,680
 And that's why the world struggles with the concept, because it doesn't seem like it's

319
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,000
 a great thing.

320
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,280
 But the code of faithfulness is how Jesus builds his kingdom.

321
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,640
 It is the priest who prepares a sermon, not knowing if anyone's going to show up for 38

322
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
 years.

323
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,760
 It is the parent who's praying for their adult child to come to faith in Jesus, even though

324
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,040
 for years it seems like they're the furthest away they could be.

325
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,320
 It is the small business owner who's making incredibly faithful, sacrificial decisions

326
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,200
 that no one will ever know in order to make sure that the business stays afloat in a tough

327
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,240
 market.

328
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:40,520
 He's day to day faithfully committed decisions and choices to what God has called us to do

329
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,640
 in the here and now.

330
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
 That is his success.

331
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:52,800
 And he looks on that and he says, "I want my church to be found faithful."

332
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,000
 One thing you have to remember is that large doors swing on small hinges.

333
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,160
 And one of the things that I love about the book of Acts is that it does from time to

334
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:09,760
 time introduce us to these small hinges, not the great Pauls and Peters, but ones who we

335
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,440
 would probably never have known unless there was a little bit of a mention of them, but

336
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,920
 ones that we can begin to get a glimpse of what it was like to be one of these unnamed

337
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,600
 or unknown sort of faithfully committed people in the church in those days.

338
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,000
 And I want to introduce you to one of them here this morning.

339
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,840
 His name is Jason.

340
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:37,520
 His story is found in Acts 17, and he's a Christian in the city of Thessalonica.

341
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,240
 And we pick up the story here.

342
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,880
 He's only mentioned in two verses in the whole of this section.

343
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,640
 But we pick up the story in the middle of Paul and Silas' recent missionary journey.

344
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,120
 They're about halfway through their missionary journey.

345
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,140
 And as part of that, they come to the city of Thessalonica.

346
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,940
 And as was their missionary kind of motif, they went to the synagogue and began to preach

347
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,840
 the good news to the synagogue.

348
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,580
 Let me pick up the story from verse 4 of chapter 17.

349
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,680
 It says, "Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large

350
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,320
 number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women.

351
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,080
 But the Jews were jealous, so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace,

352
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,880
 formed a mob, and started a riot in the city.

353
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,600
 They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out

354
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
 to the crowd."

355
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
 I love this moment.

356
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
 So here's Jason.

357
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,880
 Now, Luke doesn't give us any backstory.

358
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,000
 But just by understanding a little bit of the Greek Roman culture, a little bit of the

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,640
 history of the church, we can begin to make some pretty good assumptions about Jason as

360
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
 a person.

361
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,440
 Jason, obviously, had earned a decent amount of wealth because he had his own home, a home

362
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,200
 big enough to house Paul and Silas and some other traveling missionaries.

363
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,840
 We know that Jason was a Christian, and it was likely that he was a Christian before

364
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,920
 Paul and Silas showed up.

365
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,840
 The church in Thessalonica was already operating before Paul and Silas come as part of their

366
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,720
 missionary journey here.

367
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,120
 And it's likely that Jason may have been one of those that was in the church in Jerusalem

368
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,040
 that had been pushed out because of persecution and had moved to Thessalonica, set up his

369
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,960
 business there, and decided in his home, which was large enough, to be able to host a small

370
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,280
 church there.

371
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,640
 So although we don't have this specifically in the passage, it's very likely that Jason

372
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,400
 is running a church in his house.

373
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,160
 How many are a part of that church?

374
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,600
 We don't know, but it would have been pretty small.

375
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,240
 We're talking a little bit like my friend on the Camino, maybe five, maybe eight, maybe

376
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,400
 15 people gathering regularly in his house to believe in Jesus.

377
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,680
 Thessalonica was a hostile environment to the Christian faith.

378
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,080
 It was an incredibly difficult place to be.

379
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:58,040
 And so here's Jason, pretty much a no one, running a church in his house, doing it faithfully

380
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,880
 day in, day out in a hostile and difficult environment.

381
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,480
 And then he suddenly hears that the apostle Paul has come to town.

382
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,520
 Can you imagine what he must have felt like?

383
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,360
 He must have been like, "Finally, we're going to get a bit of success in Thessalonica.

384
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,400
 Finally, people are going to come to the Lord.

385
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,320
 Revival is going to break out in our town."

386
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,560
 You can imagine Jason being so super excited about this, and for good reason.

387
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,880
 In fact, we know from this passage here already that Paul and Silas had success as they shared

388
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,960
 the gospel in the synagogue in Thessalonica.

389
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,440
 Jews came to believe, a few prominent women came to believe, a large number of Greeks

390
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
 came to faith.

391
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,720
 There was already movement of the gospel.

392
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,720
 You can imagine that Jason and his friends probably had been praying for the gospel to

393
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,860
 take root in Thessalonica for years, and now Paul and Silas have come, and suddenly they're

394
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,680
 beginning to see the numbers that they were expecting, and they're beginning to think

395
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,480
 that now this is success.

396
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,520
 Are you with me?

397
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
 Following this?

398
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,160
 Now notice in the backdrop of that what happens next.

399
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,080
 But when they did not find them, remember the crowd are trying to find Paul and Silas,

400
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,240
 but when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city

401
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,680
 officials shouting, "These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here."

402
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,880
 And Jason has welcomed them into his house.

403
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,760
 They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king called Jesus.

404
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,200
 So here's Jason, just an ordinary kind of nobody, faithful person running a church in

405
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
 the city.

406
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,840
 When Paul shows up, things start happening.

407
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,440
 Success appears to be taking place.

408
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,040
 Then the riots are formed.

409
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,460
 The mob comes, and they show up at Jason's house.

410
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,400
 They didn't know that Paul and Silas specifically were there, but the mob was probably thinking,

411
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,320
 "Well, Jason is the only Christian we know in this town, so if Paul and Silas are with

412
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,560
 anyone, it's likely to be with these guys."

413
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,400
 And when they show up there, they can't find Paul and Silas, so what do they do?

414
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,160
 They drag Jason and some of the brothers from the church into the court, in before the magic,

415
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,040
 and they registrate of the whole city.

416
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,720
 And notice what begins to happen.

417
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,800
 They begin to say about Jason all of the issues that they had about Paul.

418
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,560
 They begin to basically accuse Jason and his brothers of all of the things that were happening

419
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
 because of Paul and Silas.

420
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,760
 In other words, Jason is suddenly in a situation where he thought revival was breaking out,

421
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,400
 but now he's actually before the courts being accused of something he did not do.

422
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:33,200
 He's now getting the punishment for what Paul and Silas should have got.

423
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,760
 He's now in a situation where he's helpless and defenseless, and the court is beginning

424
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,080
 to heap upon him the crimes that he did not commit.

425
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,080
 Not only that, but notice what happens in the next verse.

426
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,680
 It says this, "When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.

427
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,280
 Then they made Jason and the brothers post bond and let them go."

428
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,360
 The posting of bond here is critical, and this is why Luke mentions it.

429
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,480
 The posting of a bond was a payment that needed to be paid, which was an extortionate amount,

430
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,680
 but a financial payment that could be paid to ensure that the punishment had been paid

431
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,840
 for, so they didn't have to go further to jail or seek any further punishment.

432
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,640
 It's a little bit like, have you ever been on eBay and you're buying something on eBay

433
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,140
 and you're kind of like bidding to kind of do it in the auction, but then there's a price

434
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,040
 you can pay to get the thing straight away?

435
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,000
 You've been there, done that?

436
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,680
 This is what that is like.

437
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,080
 It's like if you pay this amount, you will fully pay for the punishment that should come.

438
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,680
 So here's Jason and the brothers.

439
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,840
 They willingly pay that price.

440
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,920
 It was an extortionate amount, a lot of money in those days, but they pay it and then they

441
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
 are let go.

442
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
 Think about this.

443
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,480
 I wonder if this whole thing reminds you of anything or specifically anyone.

444
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,580
 Jesus, in Jerusalem, brought before a court and the magistrates of the city at the time

445
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:08,340
 accused for a crime that he had not done, brought before them and taking on the punishment

446
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,780
 that should have come to others.

447
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:17,640
 Jesus who pays the bond price in the shedding of his blood on the cross for anyone who had

448
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
 ever sinned.

449
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:25,260
 Jesus standing in the gap, taking the punishment and the cost and paying that cost on behalf

450
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,820
 of everyone else so that they might become free.

451
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,200
 And I want you to see this.

452
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:38,700
 The cross of Calvary becomes in the world's eyes, the very definition of failure.

453
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,860
 Like if you think about worldly success and how to define it, the cross is not that.

454
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:48,620
 Jesus on the cross looked like complete and utter failure in the world's eyes.

455
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:55,740
 But God looks on his son on the cross and he sees a man who has been faithful to what

456
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,300
 he's been called to do.

457
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:07,660
 So the cross of Jesus becomes the most successful moment of all of human history where sin is

458
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:14,740
 defeated and salvation is offered for all and forgiveness is made for anyone who would

459
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:20,860
 be willing to recognize that Jesus paid the bond price.

460
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:26,540
 The center of our Christian faith in the world's eyes looks like failure, but in God's eyes,

461
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,860
 he was faithful.

462
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,580
 So here's Jason just a few years later thinking revival is about to break out.

463
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,300
 Thinking like all this great stuff is about to happen and he begins to see little bits

464
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
 of it taking place.

465
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:44,820
 And he's suddenly having to carry his own cross quite literally.

466
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,780
 He's suddenly in the same place that Jesus was in.

467
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,380
 Now I don't know about you, but if I had been Jason, I would have been tempted to react

468
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,940
 maybe like Judas.

469
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,540
 Hey guys, I know, okay, look, look, I know where Paul and Silas are.

470
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,220
 I'll tell you what, if you let me go, we're going to go into the marketplace and the man

471
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,180
 that I kissed on the cheek, that's Paul.

472
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,980
 I think Jason would have been tempted to maybe react like Peter did.

473
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,460
 Don't you think that there would have been a temptation for Jason to go, "No, I don't

474
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,220
 know who this Paul and Silas are.

475
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,500
 I've never been around them.

476
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
 I don't know who they are.

477
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
 I don't know.

478
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
 I've got nothing to do with it.

479
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
 I'm innocent.

480
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
 Look at my hands.

481
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
 They're innocent."

482
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
 Right?

483
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
 We can begin to think that maybe he's going to act like Judas, act like Peter.

484
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,540
 Here's what Jason does.

485
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,100
 He pays the price.

486
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,340
 Jason who really is a nobody, who really has not much said about him at all for the rest

487
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,740
 of Scripture, he's the one who stands in the gap because he decides, "Look, there's a cost

488
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,580
 to pay here, but I am going to be faithful to the thing that God has called me to, even

489
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,860
 if it's going to come at great cost, great price.

490
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,700
 I want to be found faithful."

491
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,540
 Which is really interesting because in the moment of the narrative, Luke continues the

492
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,580
 story of Paul and Silas.

493
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,420
 Finally Paul and Silas that very night leave Thessalonica and the narrative of Acts, you

494
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,580
 can read it later, it follows Paul and Silas off on the rest of their journey.

495
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,100
 It just follows them off and we never hear about Jason again.

496
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,780
 Can you imagine what it would have been like for Jason?

497
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:21,860
 I mean the spotlight follows the super apostles, but Jason remains in Thessalonica.

498
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,900
 Jason remains having to still lead the church.

499
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,060
 Jason remains having to now deal with not only a huge financial loss in paying the bond,

500
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:34,020
 but also now a massive reputation loss in his city.

501
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,400
 We don't know what happened to his business, but I can only imagine it was under struggle

502
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,020
 and trial then.

503
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,500
 We don't know how this would have been for him, but we can only imagine that as Paul

504
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:51,780
 and Silas move on to greener pastures, there's Jason committed to the very thing that he'd

505
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,780
 put in his hands.

506
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,340
 This is a picture of how the church grows.

507
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:05,260
 Paul and Silas would need hundreds of Jasons to stand faithfully and be committed to building

508
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,900
 his kingdom as they went through their journey.

509
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,660
 And I can stand before you here today and tell you that the vine over its last 30 years

510
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,940
 has needed many Jasons here.

511
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,740
 People that really are the epitome of faithfulness, who don't come up on the stage and get a spotlight

512
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,180
 in their face, who don't speak a good message and make you feel a certain way, but who have

513
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:33,420
 given their lives to serve in very small, almost imperceptible ways that have literally

514
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,260
 built the sustainability of this church.

515
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,740
 Let me introduce you to some of those Jasons in our midst.

516
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,620
 This is a photo of Auntie Hing and Auntie Hang.

517
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,940
 Auntie Hing and Auntie Hang are two of our creche workers.

518
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,820
 They have worked in our creche here on Sundays.

519
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,820
 Listen to this.

520
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,860
 They have worked here for almost 30 years.

521
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,300
 30 years, these women have shown up pretty much every Sunday and have looked after.

522
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,020
 And if you've been here for any season, you've had a toddler, a child, and you put that child

523
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,740
 in creche, it's these ladies that would have looked after your child.

524
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,860
 Some of you here have been at the vine for many years and your children are now in their

525
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,100
 late teens or early 20s.

526
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,400
 And these two women looked after them when they were toddlers here.

527
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,420
 These two women have served the vine without any desire for spotlight, for their stories

528
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:29,860
 to be told, for nearly 30 years showing up to do the little small thing that God had

529
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,920
 placed in their hands.

530
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,560
 They weren't worried about some big mega outcome.

531
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:43,460
 They were just being faithful to the beautiful gift of doing what God had called them to

532
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,860
 do.

533
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,140
 These two ladies have resigned.

534
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,140
 They've just resigned recently.

535
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,700
 We took this photo just a few weeks ago, blessing them with some gifts to say thank you as a

536
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,380
 staff because they are at an age now where they want to actually spend their time with

537
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,380
 their families.

538
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,460
 They're retiring essentially to do that.

539
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,500
 And we just so deeply honor them.

540
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 And it's not just Auntie Hing and Auntie Hang.

541
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,260
 There are lots of people here every Sunday.

542
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:15,300
 I think about our hosts, our Filipino ladies that serve us as hosts week in and week out.

543
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,300
 I think about those that give up their time to be with our children in KFC and our flight

544
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,300
 youth group.

545
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,460
 I think about CG leaders who have faithfully committed to being leaders even when only

546
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,700
 two or four people show up out of the 10 or 15 that are on their list each week.

547
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,580
 I'm thinking about the people throughout our church that have built this church, not because

548
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:39,620
 they're looking for some big grand thanks or some massive successful world eyes achievement,

549
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:44,180
 but simply because they want to be found faithful.

550
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:50,980
 See, what might seem like a small thing for us is not a small thing for God.

551
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:57,940
 In His eyes, it's often those very moments that shape our soul and reveal to us the value

552
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:03,180
 of His kingdom and the treasures that are found within, the faithful, small, little

553
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,460
 things.

554
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,780
 And some of you here, you're getting frustrated because you were expecting it to be grander

555
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,860
 or bigger or better.

556
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,220
 And trust me, I've been there many times.

557
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,220
 I know how that feels.

558
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,380
 Some of you, you've been pressing in and trying really hard and it seemed like there hasn't

559
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,580
 been a lot of fruit.

560
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,820
 Some of you, you're wondering, "Well, what is my contribution?

561
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,780
 I can't do this or that.

562
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,380
 I'm not like a singer like that or a speaker like this.

563
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,500
 And what is my role to play?"

564
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,700
 Some of you have been so faithful and yet it's been so challenging and so hard and so

565
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
 difficult.

566
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:44,900
 You're so close to turning the boat back and returning to harbor.

567
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,980
 Mother Teresa said this beautiful thing.

568
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,940
 She said, "Not all of us can do great things, but all of us can do small things with great

569
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
 love."

570
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:57,340
 And for some of us in this room, it's been a hard and challenging season.

571
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,700
 I remember as I was sitting having dinner with the priest in that moment in the church,

572
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,500
 I remember saying to him at one point, "Have you ever felt like giving up?"

573
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,500
 I mean, that seemed like a sensible question to ask a pastor who's pastoring a church without

574
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,300
 people in it.

575
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,460
 And his response was this.

576
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,260
 He thought for a little while and he's like, "Let me be honest with you."

577
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,460
 He said, "I have many times prayed and asked God why.

578
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,020
 Why is it that it seems like my ministry is not very fruitful?"

579
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:31,540
 But he said, "I've long learned that God doesn't very often answer the big why questions of

580
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
 life.

581
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,820
 In fact, the why is not actually to be my concern.

582
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,420
 That's his concern.

583
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,700
 My concern is the thing that he's asked me to do and I will not give up on that."

584
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:50,420
 As I was preparing this message, I felt for many of us here that perhaps we are at that

585
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,820
 moment where we want to give up.

586
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,140
 There's this beautiful moment in the Old Testament when Nehemiah, one of the leaders of Israel

587
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:04,620
 in those days, was allowed to return to Jerusalem with the project to rebuild the walls around

588
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,620
 Jerusalem.

589
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,280
 That was a big, big project.

590
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,460
 It required a huge amount of faithfulness day in and day out.

591
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,040
 It was a difficult journey for Nehemiah.

592
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,500
 Many people didn't want to bother rebuilding the walls.

593
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,500
 It was a lot of resistance to rebuilding the walls.

594
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,340
 And you can look through the story of Nehemiah and you can see the many times where he's

595
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,980
 tempted to turn back, where he's tempted to give up.

596
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,220
 And in fact, there's three chapters where there's a different attack that happens to

597
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,180
 him in each chapter.

598
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,620
 And he's so overwhelmed by that that he gets to the next chapter and he has this beautiful

599
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,620
 moment.

600
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,220
 He's not sure if he can continue, but he turns to God and he says this.

601
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,940
 He says, "Strengthen my hands."

602
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,780
 What he's saying is, "I know that you call me to be faithful to this rebuilding of the

603
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,180
 wall, but it is hard work and many people are giving up on it.

604
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,480
 And there's all these attacks and there's all these temptations to not do the project.

605
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,180
 And I know that I'm shaking and that I'm almost at the point where I'm at breaking point.

606
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:05,780
 Lord, you need to strengthen my hands because I want to be found faithful."

607
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,120
 And I believe as we move as the vine here in Hong Kong into this season of Uncharted,

608
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,780
 this is the great invitation upon us, not the grand and amazing.

609
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,600
 That's in God's hands.

610
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:22,080
 The term success and failure are not the concerns of a servant.

611
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,840
 Those are the concerns of the master.

612
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:31,200
 The concern of the servant was I faithful.

613
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,260
 I want to pray here this morning.

614
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,600
 And if you're feeling particularly like your hands are shaking, and trust me, I felt like

615
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
 that many times.

616
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,800
 If it's been a hard season for you and it's been just difficult and you're almost at the

617
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,280
 point where you want to give up, whether that's in a relationship with someone that's been

618
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,360
 really hard and challenging, whether that's in work where you've been hitting a bit of

619
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,760
 a wall at work and you're not sure how to break out of that.

620
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,760
 Maybe it's in your relationship with Jesus and it feels like there's been pushing water

621
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,320
 uphill and you're not getting much from it or whatever.

622
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,760
 For each of us, it might manifest in different ways, but we know what it feels like to want

623
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,800
 to give up on the thing that God has called us to.

624
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,800
 My prayer is that the Lord would strengthen our hands.

625
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,520
 If you would like me to pray that, would you just stand?

626
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,880
 And I want to pray over each one of us here this morning.

627
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:27,320
 And as you stand, if you would like to be prayed for in that prayer of Nehemiah's, would

628
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,440
 you just gently open your hands before you?

629
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,360
 Father, I want to thank you so much for the men, women, children, families that are here

630
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,200
 in this room, those watching online, those in our overflow.

631
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,160
 Father, we stand before you now recognizing that in this season of calling us to uncharted

632
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,360
 territory and uncharted waters, the temptation might be to expect the grand or look for the

633
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,360
 bigger and better.

634
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,320
 We are grateful, Lord, that you do not define success in the kingdom in the same way that

635
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
 the world does.

636
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,920
 And Lord, I want to pray first of all over every family in this room, over every marriage

637
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,120
 in this room, over every relationship in this room.

638
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:17,200
 I want to lift the pressure to perform as the world would expect, the pressure to succeed

639
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,120
 as the world would define it.

640
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:26,520
 The Lord does not look over you and expect you to produce amazing things, but he does

641
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:33,200
 look over you and asks if you're being faithful.

642
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,960
 And Lord, I'm so grateful that in that parable of the talents, where those that had been

643
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,880
 faithful with what you had given them, you come to them and you say, "Well done, my good

644
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
 and faithful servant.

645
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,440
 You have been faithful in the small things.

646
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,200
 Now come and partake and share in your master's happiness."

647
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,080
 Lord, for these people in this room, Lord, I want to pray that as you pour out your spirit

648
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,280
 on them and as you strengthen their hands for the season ahead, they would hear your

649
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:07,440
 voice personally say to them, "Well done, my good and faithful servant.

650
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,440
 My prayer for us as a church community is that in our workplaces, in our education spheres,

651
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,120
 in our spheres of influence in Hong Kong, that the Lord would say, "Oh man, the people

652
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,820
 around you, they are privileged to be in your presence."

653
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,960
 Not because you're suddenly getting great promotions, suddenly making loads more money,

654
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,720
 suddenly achieving awards, but simply because you've been found faithful with the gospel

655
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,920
 in your hands, to the thing that perhaps no one will ever know that you did, but it was

656
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,100
 an act of integrity.

657
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:47,480
 And Lord, I want to pray for each one of us who are feeling weak, myself included.

658
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,840
 Lord, we want to join with Nehemiah, knowing that it's not easy to be faithful.

659
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:59,400
 It's not easy to remain like Jason behind and have to do the hard everyday work of showing

660
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
 up.

661
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,360
 But Lord, for those in this room where they're close to giving up, we pray, Holy Spirit,

662
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,480
 you would strengthen their hands.

663
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,480
 We pray for a faithful church, Lord.

664
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,940
 We pray that you would release upon us your spirit that would strengthen us and enable

665
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,760
 us to walk to whatever future it might be.

666
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,920
 Lord, we let go of whether there are lands ahead of us or not.

667
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,440
 You're the one with the telescope.

668
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,480
 It is in your sovereign hands.

669
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,880
 But right now, Lord, the everyday commitment to what you've asked us to do in this moment

670
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,520
 is in ours.

671
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
 Strengthen our hands.

672
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:44,440
 And Father, as we're strengthened, we pray that what happened for Jason might also happen

673
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,640
 for us.

674
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,440
 Because we know that years later, Paul would see that the church at Thessalonica was significant

675
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,160
 enough that he would write letters that we now have in the Bible.

676
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,760
 And Lord, I pray that in our everyday faithfulness to even the ordinary and the mundane, your

677
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,720
 glory would be seen.

678
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,720
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

679
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,680
 Everyone says.

680
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,260
 (gentle music)
