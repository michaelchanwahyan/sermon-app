[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   Today we continue our sermon series on a remedy for relationships and we have Pastor Tim.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.000]   Communal relationships. The last three and a half years, they've been exhausting.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.120]   First we had social unrest, we had the protests in 2019, and then in 2020, Covid-19, the pandemic hit.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.600]   So I don't know about you, but this season just has been tiring and has been wearing us out to
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   one degree or another. So it's no surprise that this has impacted us in many different ways.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:50.640]   So in some ways that this has impacted us relationally, socially, economically,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.640]   emotionally, but also spiritually. Our relationship with Jesus
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.800]   has suffered during this time for many of us.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.760]   There's many different reasons for that and I'm just going to name a few. It might not be your
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.360]   reason, but I believe there's ways that everyone has been impacted by what's been happening.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.720]   So perhaps during this time you got stuck in addictive behavior.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.880]   Maybe it's an old addiction, maybe it was something new.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:37.840]   Maybe the worries that all this, what's happening around us, the social isolation, all that brought
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.680]   just was so overwhelming and absorbed all our time and all our energy. That was just crushing us
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.800]   and it's this heavy burden that's been like just laying on our shoulder.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:02:00.240]   Then for others, perhaps you've been upset with God, the church, even church leadership,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.120]   or maybe we're just tired and we're drained and there's just a level of exhaustion that
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.680]   just doesn't seem to go away. It's been running on empty for quite a while.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.320]   So I don't know exactly what's been happening in your life, but to one degree or another,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.080]   we all have been impacted and our relationship with Jesus has impacted.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:29.680]   So today, we want to hear how God wants to speak to us about that, speak into our lives about this
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.280]   tiredness, this exhaustion. And so we're going to explore two questions together. The first one is,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.520]   how does Jesus invite us to receive the grace and the life that he has to offer that restores,
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.640]   renews, and truly satisfies? So that's the first question. And then the second one that we're
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.400]   going to look at is, what are some of the ways of relating to Jesus that have kept us from
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:07.680]   experiencing all the fullness that he has to offer to us? So we are in the Remedy of Relationships
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.800]   series, and today our topic is communal relationships. We're going to look at the
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.040]   count of Jesus in the Gospel of John. And before we read the passage together, I just want to set
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:27.600]   the context for us. So Jesus is by the Lake of Galilee, and he's in the middle of nowhere,
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.040]   but people have been following. So there's 5,000 plus people with him, and he does an incredible
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.080]   miracle. People are hungry, they need food, and so he multiplies bread and fish so that everyone
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:49.440]   has enough to eat. I mean, it's amazing. But then Jesus discerns that the crowd, they want to make
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.840]   him king, and they have an agenda for him, but that's not the type of king that Jesus has come
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.840]   to be. And so he decides to withdraw, and he goes to the mountainside. And in the meantime,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.520]   the disciples, they take the only boat, and they start heading back to Capernaum,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.400]   on the other side of the lake. And I'm like, "Why are the disciples taking off without Jesus?
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.800]   What kind of friends are that? Just leaving him behind, right?" So then in the middle of the night,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.000]   Jesus, he also starts heading back, and another miracle occurs. He walks on water,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.400]   and he meets some of the disciples, and they go to Capernaum. So that's where we are picking up
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.760]   the story. The crowd wakes up from their camping trip in the wilderness, and they're looking for
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.080]   Jesus. Where did he go? And they take some boats, and also head to Capernaum, and that's where we
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:51.920]   enter. It's John 6, verse 25 to 35. So it says, "When they found him on the other side of the lake,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.240]   they asked him, 'Rabbi, when did you get here?' Jesus answered, 'Very truly I tell you,
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.080]   you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed, but because you ate the loaves
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.680]   and you had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.840]   which the Son of Man will give you. For in him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.'
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.800]   Then they asked him, 'What must we do to do the works God requires?'
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.760]   Jesus answered, 'The work of God is this, to believe in the one he has sent.' So then they
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.240]   ask him, 'What sign will he give us that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?'"
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.720]   Just think of this right now for a moment. He just did this incredible miracle,
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.560]   and right now they're asking Jesus again for a sign. Crazy, right? Continuing,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.640]   "Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.520]   eat.' So Jesus said to them, 'Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who gave you that bread from
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.640]   heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:22.720]   bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.' 'Sir,' they said, 'always give us
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:30.240]   this bread.' Then Jesus declared, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.320]   and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.'"
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:41.920]   So here we have a part of a dialogue between the crowd and Jesus.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.320]   And there are some postures and some attitudes in the crowd that I want us to take a look at,
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.800]   because these postures and attitudes, they actually undermine what Jesus wants to do
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.160]   in the people's lives. And it's keeping them from fully experiencing and fully receiving
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.160]   what Jesus has to offer to them. And I believe that we hold those same postures,
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.200]   and they also stand in the way of what Jesus wants to do in our lives.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.800]   So let's look. There's three things we're going to look at. Let's look at the first one.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.240]   So when they find Jesus in Capernaum, they ask him, "When did you get here?"
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:32.720]   And asking this question, "When," is rather trivial. Basically, it's small talk.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.640]   And Jesus, it's interesting how he responds. He doesn't say when he got there, how he got there.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:46.000]   He's not like, "Oh yeah, so I was on the mountain, and then about 3 a.m. at night, I decided to walk
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.720]   on water, and then at 3.45, you know, I arrived." So he doesn't do that. But what he does is he cuts
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.320]   right through the chase, and he gets right to what's going on. He speaks truth, and he says this.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.800]   He says, "Very truly, I tell you, you're looking for me, not because you saw the sign I performed,
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.680]   but because you ate the loaves and you had your fill."
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:18.000]   Now, Jesus, he loves us, and he doesn't shy away from confronting us, but also speaking truth to us.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.320]   Because he wants for us to fully receive what he has to offer. He doesn't want the crowd to
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.800]   miss that. But he doesn't shy away from calling things out. Whenever we come before Jesus,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:37.680]   he knows everything about our lives anyhow. And he already has decided that he loves us,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.000]   and his grace and forgiveness, he wants to extend that to us.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.560]   But the crowd, he's discerning that they're coming to him with wrong motives.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:59.200]   And they don't come to him because they saw him perform the sign that pointed to that he is the
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.600]   son of God, that he's the Redeemer, he's the way that Messiah. That's not why they come to him.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:11.120]   They come because their stomachs were filled. They got food. And so they focus on the sign,
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.480]   the bread, instead of what that bread and that multiplication of the bread, what that points to,
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.280]   the significance of it, and the thing that Jesus wants them to see.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:38.240]   And they approach Jesus with their own agenda. They want Jesus to make more food for them.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:46.480]   Now, today when you ask somebody, or if you ask, actually let's do it this way, if you ask somebody
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.800]   back then, "Why do you work?" They would say, "We work just to put food on our table and to survive."
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.440]   You know, that's really the reason why you work. And scholars, they estimate that about 80% of
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:06.400]   people's income back then went just to providing for food. Now, for some of us, that might still
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.520]   be true today, but for a lot of us, we don't use as much of our money for providing food.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:17.600]   And so this food was very significant to the people. It was a matter of life and death.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:26.960]   And so they're focused on the food, and they want Jesus to make more food. They want to fit
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.240]   Jesus into their agenda, into their business. They're like, "Hey, Jesus, let's make more food.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:39.040]   You make more food, and then we can start this fishing business. We can buy a boat,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.320]   you know, the thing that we always dreamed of. We can buy that field." I'm just trying to imagine
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.960]   what people dream of, you know, back then. Fishing boats, fields, chickens.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:58.400]   But we still do the same thing today. We also approach Jesus with the wrong motives,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:04.800]   and we try to fit him into our agenda, that Jesus helps us, you know, succeed in business,
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:11.040]   that Jesus helps us or does this relationship thing for us. And it's okay to bring those
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.360]   things to Jesus. Actually, we can come with those things to him, and he loves when we pray and bring
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:23.280]   those up. He loves to bless his people. He loves to give good gifts to his children. He loves that.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:30.240]   But when we only come for him to accomplish our agenda, and we don't care about the relationship.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.840]   We're just, we miss Jesus who's standing right in front of us.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.880]   We miss what he wants to give us, because we're just so focused on our agenda.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.640]   So, when we only approach Jesus with the purpose of having him help us achieve our goals and
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:51.680]   accomplish our own ends, we miss out on what he truly has to offer us, which is a life-transforming
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.320]   relationship. Now, I don't know if you have experienced that when you're interacting with
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:03.360]   somebody, that they just talk to you because they're trying to get you to accomplish their agenda. And
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.640]   they're super focused on that. I've had this experience to the point where I'm like, even like,
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.920]   "Hey, I'm here." Like, but I felt like not even acknowledged as a person. So, Jesus is saying,
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.120]   "I'm right here to the crowd. Don't miss out on me, what I have to offer to you."
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:27.360]   So, we try to fit Jesus in our agenda, and we miss out on the relationship, the grace, and the life
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:35.200]   that he has to offer to us, that he wants to give us and pour out over our lives, and let this good,
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   beautiful work unfold in us. So, what are some ways that you're trying to fit Jesus into your agenda?
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:53.280]   Well, let's look at how the conversation can take place.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:13:00.320]   Well, let's look at how the conversation continues. So, Jesus continues to respond. He says,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:07.360]   "Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:15.440]   Man will give you. For in him, God the Father has placed the seal of approval." So, besides exposing
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:22.320]   their wrong motives and agendas when they come to Jesus, now he encourages them to stop striving
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.960]   and working for food that does not truly, fully fulfill.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:37.360]   And he asks them to focus on food that endures to eternal life. So, what Jesus is saying to
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.240]   the crowd is, "Stop chasing after things that don't fully satisfy you. You're chasing after
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:53.600]   the wrong things." And so, we long for this deeper quality of life. We have these deep longings of
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.960]   significance. We want to be significant. We want to be worthy. We want to be lovable, loved.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:08.960]   And we try to find those things in material things and other things, and we chase after them.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:18.560]   And we say to ourselves, "I know what will make me happy. If only I could have this flat, this job,
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:24.400]   this education, then I will truly be happy. Then I will truly be whole."
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.480]   And so, then we start chasing after those things.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.640]   Now, I remember when I was a teenager in the 90s, so it's been a while,
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:44.720]   the big popular thing at that time were Levi 501 jeans. Come on now. I heard, somebody told me that
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:52.320]   they're popular again. Is that true? Yeah? Kind of? Yeah? And so, for me, I thought, "If I get those
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.840]   jeans, I'm going to be cool. And the girl I have is going to have a crush on, she's going to like me."
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:04.400]   And so, I went to my parents, and I also told them what the, how much the jeans cost, which at that
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.960]   time was 200 marks, 100 US dollars, which now is like 200 or something like that. And they're like,
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:18.000]   "No." So, my dreams were crushed. But then we went to the US, and in the US, that pair cost $32 or
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.200]   something like that. And I was like, "Yes!" And so, I got a pair or two. And when I came back,
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:32.880]   did they really deliver on being cool? Not really. Did they really help with the crush?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.560]   So, I wrote her a little love note, put it in her pencil case, that was like the thing back then.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:45.120]   And then she thought that somebody was trying to mess with me and had sort of written a fake note.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:53.120]   Ouch. So, it didn't work with either. But I know this is kind of a silly story, but the reason why
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.840]   I'm telling this story is because I had this object, these jeans, and they stirred within me
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:04.960]   a desire that I thought, "If only I had this, then I will be cool. Then I will be loved."
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:12.800]   We do the same thing with objects and with relationships. They stir within us a desire
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.680]   and a longing. They touch on something very deep inside of us. We say, "If only I have this,
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.520]   then I will be okay. Then I will be whole. Then I will be content. Then I will be truly happy."
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:36.960]   And so, we make things that are good things in themselves, we make them ultimate things.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:45.120]   We turn them into idols that we believe will fulfill our deepest longings, and we chase after
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:52.400]   them. Now, Tim Keller, a well-known New York City pastor, he defines idols as follows. He puts it,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:58.240]   "An idol is anything more important to you than God, anything that absorbs your heart and
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:05.200]   imagination more than God, anything you seek to give you what only God can give."
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:15.200]   Now, those jeans, they stirred in my heart and my imagination. It really was a focus for me,
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:22.000]   and we have other things in our lives that do the same thing for us. And we think that this
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.520]   job or this degree or this relationship will bring this deep satisfaction.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:34.640]   And a lot of times, they do bring pleasure. They're not bad things in themselves,
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:41.600]   but they never fully deliver what we hope for and what we expect. And what we do then is like,
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.520]   "Well, you know, oh yeah, that's okay." And then we set our heart on something else,
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.960]   we chase after that, and we think that that will give us this true contentment, this true happiness.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:58.880]   But it fails to deliver. And so Jesus is saying to the crowd, "Do not work for food that spoils,
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   but for food that endures eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:10.000]   Come and receive from me the life that I have to offer to you. Let me fill you,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:20.960]   because I do deliver. I do satisfy. I do meet those deep longings that nothing else can fill."
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:31.760]   So Jesus challenges us to stop investing all our time and energy into trying to find fulfillment
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:38.960]   in material things, and instead invest ourselves in Him as our source of true and lasting satisfaction.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:49.920]   So what's been taking up your imagination? What's been stirring in your heart? And what have you
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:19:00.800]   been chasing after? So the third thing in that dialogue between a crowd I want to highlight is,
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:07.040]   so Jesus, He challenged the crowd to work for food that endures. And so the crowd,
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:14.880]   they pick up on the word "work." "Work? I like to work." And they asked Him, "What
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:21.840]   must we do to do the works God requires?" They're asking Jesus to give them a to-do list
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:29.440]   so they can receive His favor, receive His blessing, that they can be acceptable.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:37.280]   Because they want to know what they need to do. And basically the idea with which
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:44.240]   they're relating to Jesus is that God's goodness, love, and generosity towards them, towards us,
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:51.920]   depends on our efforts. Like if I'm a good person, if I'm a good Christian, if I pray more and stop
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.720]   doing the bad thing that I'm doing, then Jesus will love me, then I will be okay, then He will
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:05.440]   bless my plans that I have. And we do that. And it's not surprising because that's actually how
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:12.480]   a lot of our life works. You know, when we were children, if we were a bad boy or a bad girl,
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.440]   then we didn't get the reward, but if we were good, we got the cookie.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:30.400]   And it also works in a lot of relationships for us that way, that we have to earn favor or work
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.600]   on, you know, recovering the favor that we maybe had and earn that love back. And so it's no
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.800]   surprise that we apply the same thing to God. Maybe try to earn God's favor, we try to earn
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:49.840]   God's blessing, we try to earn God's love, but that's not how it works. Because Jesus, He loves
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:58.000]   us. So Jesus, He responds to that, that way of approaching Him through works and through our
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.600]   efforts. In verse 29, He says this, "The work of God is this, to believe in the one He has sent."
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.960]   And it's interesting because before the crowd asked Him, "What works must we do?" So they're
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:19.040]   focusing on themselves and the works that they need to do. But now here, it's talking about
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:26.720]   the work of God, so the work that God already has done. And all they need to do is to believe
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.360]   in the one He has sent, which is Jesus talking to them.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.000]   Because the only way of receiving and experiencing God's love is
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.960]   if we place our trust in Him. We can't earn it. It's a grace gift,
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:49.520]   this unmerited God's goodness that He just wants to pour on us and give us.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:55.200]   But a lot of times, we work really hard to earn God's love.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:04.240]   We try to redeem ourselves instead of letting Jesus redeem us. We put faith in our own works
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.720]   instead of putting faith in what God has already done.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:15.520]   And a lot of times, we like it that way because then we can feel like God owes us something or
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:22.400]   we can demand something from God. But God, just in His love and goodness, He just wants to pour
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:28.000]   His forgiveness, His life. He wants to renew us. He just wants to pour that into our lives.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:36.480]   But we can only receive it as a gift when we come to Him and just receive what He has to offer to us.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:46.080]   So let's briefly review these three ways of how the crowd related to Jesus and how we a lot of
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:52.240]   times relate to Jesus. First, there was trying to put Jesus, fitting Jesus into our agenda,
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.200]   where we just try to have Jesus accomplish what we're trying to do. We don't really care about
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.840]   how He wants to relate to us or who He is. We just want Him to do for us what we want done.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:12.480]   So that's the first thing. Then, there is the part where we focus on material things
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:18.560]   and we think that they're going to fully satisfy us. We even forget about Jesus. We get distracted.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.440]   And we think that these things will make us happy. And so we chase after them. We give
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:30.000]   it our energy. We give it our life. But it always comes up short. Yes, there is some pleasure,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.960]   but it always comes up short. It never fully delivers.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:43.120]   And then, we try to earn favor. We try to earn God's love. And we strive so hard. And it's so
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:51.600]   exhausting and depressing because it's never enough. But again, that's not how it works.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:58.320]   Because Jesus just freely wants to pour the Spirit on us and give us this life that He has for us.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:09.040]   So now, we see in all these ways that we come and we approach Jesus or have or that has crept back
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.960]   into our lives. But let's turn to the question we originally asked, which was, "How does Jesus
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:21.760]   invite us to receive the grace and life that He has to offer that restores, that renews,
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:28.080]   and that truly satisfies?" How do we receive that? How do we receive that today?
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:36.960]   Because a lot of us are exhausted and tired. And there's brokenness in our lives.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:47.760]   Maybe we barely made it to church today. Maybe we're just watching online. We've barely turned
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:54.080]   on the service because we're so ashamed about what's been happening in our lives.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:02.480]   And we feel so distanced from God. But if you notice throughout the dialogue, Jesus keeps
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:10.160]   leaning in. He doesn't give up on us. He didn't give up on the crowd. He keeps wanting to draw
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:16.240]   them in and wanting them to fully see Him, who He is and what He has to offer. And He wants to do
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:25.040]   the same here today with us. He wants you to fully see Him and to receive what He has to offer to you.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.320]   His love, His grace, His goodness, His kindness. He just wants to pour it on you.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.680]   We're exhausted. He wants to renew you.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.400]   Where there's an addiction, He wants to break the power of addiction in your life.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:49.440]   That's what Jesus does. So the dialogue continues with the crowd.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:56.800]   And then we come to this ultimate declaration that Jesus makes in verse 35. He says,
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.400]   "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:16.880]   will never be thirsty. I am the source that fully satisfies in a way that nothing else can satisfy."
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.720]   That's what Jesus is saying. If you notice, He used the phrase "I am."
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.400]   In the book of Exodus, God uses that phrase to reveal who He is, His name to Moses.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:37.760]   And so this is a revelation moment where Jesus is revealing who He is to the crowd
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.840]   so that they may fully see Him, that they know that life and satisfaction are found in Him.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:51.600]   And in the Gospel of John, there's seven "I am" statements where every time Jesus reveals
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.160]   a little bit more about who He is and who He wants us to know who He is.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:07.840]   And He does the same today. He reveals Himself to us. He makes Himself known to every person.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:14.960]   Because He wants you to see, He wants us to see who He is,
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.640]   and how He loves us, how He meets us,
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:29.920]   even when our lives are a mess, when they're broken, when they're in shambles, when they're ugly.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:41.840]   So the remedy for brokenness, for our brokenness,
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.080]   tiredness, and emptiness is found when we come to Jesus.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:51.280]   When we commune with Him, He invites us into a relationship.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:58.080]   And when we receive His grace poured out over us through the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.960]   I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:12.480]   Our messy and broken lives, they're renewed not because of what we do,
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:18.160]   but they're renewed because of what Jesus has to offer and what He has done.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:24.560]   And a lot of times you feel like that we first need to clean up our life and get our lives together.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.040]   And I first need to stop my addiction before I can come to Jesus.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.080]   But that's not how it works. Jesus is just saying, "Come, come to me.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:43.040]   Let me fill you with that bread, with that water that quenches your thirst and your hunger."
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:55.040]   And that's when we come, and because we come to Jesus, that the power of sin is broken in our lives.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.520]   And when He pours out His Spirit, His Holy Spirit into us,
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:10.320]   because of the Spirit's work and the grace, we can become different people. We can live differently.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:17.440]   That's how it works. We come to Jesus' empty hand and we say, "Jesus, I need you."
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:27.280]   We just pour whatever's been going on. And then Jesus, He loves pouring out His grace for us.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.680]   He loves us and He wants to give us this life that He has to offer.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.440]   So as we receive this grace, it never leaves us untouched.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:45.200]   God's grace touches us, moves us, because it's so beautiful and it's so undeserved.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   The grace of God, it breaks the power of sin and addiction in our lives.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.680]   And today, as I was praying, I did really have the sense
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.480]   that some of us are struggling in that area, and there's been a lot of shame,
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.880]   and it's even been making it hard for us to come to church.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:11.360]   But Jesus today, He wants to break the addiction and the sin, the power of that over your life.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:17.680]   He wants to set you free, because He loves you. You're not created to live in that way.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:24.880]   He has something better for you.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:33.600]   And so when the grace of God is poured out over us, we become, it says in the Gospel of John,
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.560]   "become born again, born by the Spirit." He gives us new life. We're a new creation.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:44.080]   If anyone is in Christ Jesus, He's a new creation. The old has gone, the new has come.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.440]   Jesus does something new, something beautiful. We come with our brokenness. He takes it,
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:57.600]   and He does something new. And He does it over and over again, because even if you're Christian,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:04.880]   we still need His grace. We still need His filling. We still need His renewing work in our lives.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:13.520]   And so He's inviting all of us to come to Him, to receive, to be filled up again, to be renewed.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:27.040]   I was at a point in my life a few years ago where I was just empty, had nothing left.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:33.760]   I honestly didn't care if I died at that point. I've shared this story before.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.680]   And I came to Jesus empty-handed.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:52.800]   And He met me, and He poured where I had lost hope. He gave me hope and renewed faith. I thought
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:57.600]   there was no point in living on and moving forward. But He gave me hope to move forward.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.720]   And where I saw a dead end, He created a new and an open way for me.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.800]   And He spoke words over my life. "I am not finished with you yet."
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.320]   And Jesus right now, He's speaking that over our lives here. "I am not finished with you yet.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.200]   I'm going to do something new. I'm going to break the power of sin that's been holding
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.840]   you back from all that I want to give you. And He's not finished with us yet.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.800]   So I'm going to pray over us. Let me do this right now.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:38.080]   Jesus, we come to you. We're tired. We're exhausted. We're stuck in sin.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:49.120]   We're angry. You know what people are feeling and experiencing and where they're at.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.160]   And Jesus, I thank you that when we come to you, when we come empty-handed, we say, "Jesus, I need
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:03.920]   you. That you meet us every single time. That you never disappoint. That you pour your Spirit over us.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:11.440]   That you do a beautiful, healing, renewing, and restoring work. And Jesus, I pray right now,
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.480]   you know what everybody's going through. And I pray that in the unique way that everyone needs
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.120]   us right now, that you, Holy Spirit, we ask you to come and minister to people's hearts.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.720]   That you do that healing, renewing, refreshing work in people's lives.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:38.240]   That you pour out your grace. We need it, Jesus. And we give you the thanks that you forgive us,
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.240]   that you love us, that you redeem us, that you renew us, and that you are refreshing us right now.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.560]   I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:55.200]   I do want to invite you to just meditate and come to Jesus right now on your own.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.720]   And then in a little while, the worship team will lead us in worship. So let's do that right now.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:06.000]   Talk to God. Share with him what's been going on. And receive his grace.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:17.440]   And receive the Holy Spirit and the work he wants to do in your life.
