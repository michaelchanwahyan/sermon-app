1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
 Yeah, actually, Philip, why don't you come up here?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,200
 So this is Pastor Philip.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,680
 He's, let's welcome him, yeah?

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,560
 (audience applauding)

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,640
 He's a colleague and a friend,

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,360
 so he's the young adult's pastor in one tribe.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,360
 And you know, one thing that always strikes me about Philip

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,200
 is sometimes you meet people who just have

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,080
 a genuine, deep, personal relationship with Jesus.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,240
 You know, and that's something that I always see in Philip,

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,960
 just when he talks, when he prays for me, when we share.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,880
 You know, it's somebody that lives in that intimacy.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,920
 And so I'm always blessed, so I know we'll be blessed also

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,640
 by what God has spoken to him.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,360
 Also, his wife, Christina, and Cyril are here as well,

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,840
 so we're excited to have all of you,

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,160
 but I would love to pray for you and for us,

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,280
 so let's stretch our hands and let's pray.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,920
 Jesus, thank you so much for Philip,

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,480
 for your work in his life, for your calling,

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,080
 for your anointing.

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,760
 Pray that, Holy Spirit, you strengthen him,

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
 empower him today to deliver what you have spoken to him.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,440
 And Lord, I also pray for us as a church

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,760
 that you would open our hearts, our minds,

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,000
 for what it is that you wanna speak,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,120
 and that we would be ready to respond to what you say.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,720
 We pray this in your name, Jesus, amen.

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,120
 - Amen, thank you, Tim.

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,640
 Hello, exciting to be here.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,360
 So, you know, if you do see me in Yuen Long or in Wan Chai,

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,440
 just call me Philip.

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,960
 I feel the more endearing term is just Philip, you know.

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,800
 Anyway, we're back in this Longing for Healing series,

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,800
 and I am so excited, particularly because I also possess

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,520
 a chronic health condition.

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,160
 Some of you might know of it from our January devotions.

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,280
 I'm gonna share a little bit more about it.

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,680
 But, you know, starting in my youth,

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,400
 I was always circling and marking places in the gospels

41
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,800
 where it talks about Jesus's healing,

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,360
 as I prayed for that healing to also take effect

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,400
 and take place in me.

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,040
 And so today I'm just gonna share what God's heart

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,760
 is on healing for all of us,

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,040
 and maybe there is something for all of us to learn.

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,880
 The over the past few weeks,

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,720
 there was one important point that we learned about healing

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,480
 and that God's healing is universal.

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,280
 God's healing is for all.

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,120
 And as I was mincing these words,

52
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,960
 two things really draw out.

53
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,920
 One is that when we say that God's healing is for all,

54
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,040
 we're talking about the non-discriminatory nature

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,240
 of God's healing.

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,040
 God wants to heal regardless of our status,

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,960
 regardless of our condition,

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,480
 regardless of what religion we have, what gender we are.

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,400
 So it's regardless of what disposition it talks about worth,

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,560
 he doesn't care, he gives healing in that way.

61
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,720
 This is very important because we, as Pastor Tim shared,

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,440
 we also play a part in each other's healing.

63
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,000
 We are agents of healing,

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,120
 and we don't wanna get in the way of God's healing

65
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,560
 just because we have a different opinion

66
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,920
 about who should get healed and who shouldn't get healed.

67
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,120
 Okay, so I talked about the non-discriminatory nature

68
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
 of why healing is universal.

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,960
 Now I wanna talk about the breadth of healing.

70
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,080
 It is for those who are seeking physical healing like me,

71
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,120
 it is to those who are seeking

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,540
 under the service kind of healing,

73
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,960
 some deep psychological, mental, social,

74
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,040
 any types of healing that we can't really see in the outside.

75
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,640
 And if we go even one step further,

76
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,800
 and I'm talking about the breadth here,

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,440
 we're talking about people

78
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,840
 who aren't necessarily seeking healing as well.

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,520
 Healing is also for them.

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,320
 Healing is for those who think,

81
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,040
 actually, I'm quite fine on a perfectly fine day.

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
 There isn't much or any to heal from.

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,520
 And we believe that God's breadth of healing,

84
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,200
 also there's healing taking place for them.

85
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,580
 Healing is discipleship.

86
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,200
 And so if we draw together the non-discriminatory nature

87
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,280
 and the breadth of God's healing and why healing is for all,

88
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,000
 we come to this message today.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,680
 We arrive here and we can say, hang on,

90
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,200
 maybe that this message is also for all.

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,840
 Healing is for all, this message is for all,

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,940
 and nobody could actually be complacent here

93
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,180
 to say, actually, it doesn't apply to me.

94
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,680
 And so with this, how about we go into today's message?

95
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,480
 Notice here in today's message,

96
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,480
 Zacchaeus, which we're gonna be talking about in Luke 19,

97
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,160
 he wasn't necessarily seeking healing as well,

98
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,320
 if we notice it.

99
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,420
 If we know the story,

100
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,400
 he was trying to get on the tree to see Jesus,

101
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,880
 and he wasn't after anything.

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,160
 And yet, the irony of picking this story today

103
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,720
 for the Longing for Healing series is making this point,

104
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,900
 that this message and that healing is for all of us.

105
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,900
 So why don't we read together Luke 19, verse one to 10.

106
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,280
 You can follow me on three, one, two, and three.

107
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,680
 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.

108
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
 A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus.

109
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,480
 He was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.

110
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,000
 He wanted to see who Jesus was,

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,600
 but because he was short, he could not see over the crowd.

112
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,200
 So he ran ahead and climbed the sycamore fig tree

113
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,400
 to see him.

114
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,600
 Since Jesus was coming that way,

115
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,120
 when Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him,

116
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,840
 Zacchaeus, come down immediately.

117
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,440
 I must stay at your house today.

118
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
 So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.

119
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,520
 All the people saw this began to mutter.

120
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,560
 He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.

121
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,160
 But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord,

122
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,320
 look, Lord, here and now,

123
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,920
 I give half of my possessions to the poor,

124
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,920
 and if I've cheated anybody out of anything,

125
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,960
 I will pay back four times the amount.

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,560
 Jesus said to him, today salvation has come to this house

127
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,120
 because this man too is a son of Abraham.

128
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,840
 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.

129
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,960
 Thank you, Jesus.

130
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,440
 So as we read the passage, it doesn't take a fine eye

131
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,440
 to notice that something is quite not pleasant with Zacchaeus.

132
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,000
 We know everything that Luke writes about

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,760
 has been handed on to him by eyewitnesses.

134
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,600
 And so as we are Luke's audience,

135
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,520
 we can really gauge the sentiment in the room.

136
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,560
 We can exactly visualize what's happening here

137
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,320
 that nobody really likes Zacchaeus.

138
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,320
 The first descriptions already tell us how far off

139
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,760
 he fared in his own people's estimate.

140
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,400
 He's a tax collector, and assumedly,

141
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,040
 he was made very wealthy from tax collecting.

142
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,160
 And it wasn't just that the people didn't like pay taxes.

143
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,160
 My green envelope just came in this April.

144
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,840
 I guess none of us gladly anticipate the green envelope

145
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
 that comes in our mailbox every year.

146
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,520
 And yet, we know that the tax collected

147
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,400
 actually goes into the public system

148
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,520
 for at least some sort of good.

149
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,760
 And so we don't have a personal kind of hatred

150
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,760
 on the officers and the inland revenue.

151
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,360
 And yet, for Zacchaeus, the people had it going against him.

152
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,320
 It was very personal.

153
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,680
 And the reason is that the tax collected

154
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,400
 didn't just go back into the local public systems.

155
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,560
 Instead, it was a tax Zacchaeus collected

156
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,480
 in collaboration with the Romans.

157
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,440
 Whatever money that was collected,

158
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,320
 and after meeting the Roman quota,

159
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,040
 Zacchaeus could pocket this money as his own.

160
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,680
 And he was able to do so on his own people

161
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,480
 because the Romans had afforded him the authority.

162
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,200
 So in effect, Zacchaeus betrayed his own

163
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,880
 with the national enemy at the time

164
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,360
 and made a living out of dishonest gain.

165
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,920
 The tax collector, the term the tax collector,

166
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,960
 is so detested in Jewish society that it

167
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,520
 is used in conjunction with another term, sinner.

168
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,520
 And all sorts of foul language one could think of,

169
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,040
 you would use it and mix it all with the term tax collector.

170
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,080
 And think about this.

171
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,040
 Out of all of them, Zacchaeus was chief.

172
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,880
 He was chief tax collector.

173
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,720
 OK, we're going to top up some more unpleasantness

174
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,360
 on the image of Zacchaeus.

175
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,920
 Verses 3 and 4 makes mention of his stature,

176
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,400
 that the crowd was too tall for him,

177
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,200
 and that Zacchaeus had to go up a tree just to be

178
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,720
 able to see Jesus come through.

179
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,720
 So Luke is not just simply passing on information

180
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,120
 as objective facts here, but he needs us to read the room.

181
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,000
 When do we ever see short people climb trees?

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,680
 Can you just detect the sour negativity here?

183
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,000
 It's not just facts here.

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,840
 It's not how many centimeters, but actually a short person

185
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,560
 climbing a tree.

186
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,200
 He also wasn't just short like how Pastor Tim kind of towers

187
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,400
 over us and how he sees all 90% Hong Kong people.

188
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,720
 But he is abnormally short.

189
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
 Zacchaeus was like a dwarf.

190
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,440
 He had a dwarfism stature, someone

191
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,280
 who was abnormally short.

192
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,200
 And the crowd is not just too tall for him physically.

193
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,520
 The crowd is not simply just physically towering

194
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,080
 over Zacchaeus and overshadowing his sight for Jesus.

195
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,480
 That is just the face value of the reading.

196
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,760
 Sure, sometimes things can just physically

197
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,520
 get in the way of us meeting with Jesus, missing a bus.

198
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,720
 That's a physical thing.

199
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,440
 And yet the debilitating thing here

200
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,840
 is that Jesus was unnecessarily kept out of reach and sight

201
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,120
 because of the social stigma and perception

202
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,960
 that the crowd had placed on Zacchaeus.

203
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,800
 And so we see it in verse 7 with the people's

204
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,200
 whinging and muttering.

205
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,000
 Jesus has gone to be the guest of a sinner.

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,880
 Again, in this verse, it's not an objective fact here.

207
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,000
 They're actually grumbling and moaning

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,360
 that somebody, a sinner, is actually

209
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,840
 tagging alongside a moral teacher in those days.

210
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,920
 So if we are honest to ourselves,

211
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,440
 at times we have been like the crowd, whereby

212
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,760
 we choose to serve our emotions on who should rightfully have

213
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,920
 access to God's grace and mercy, rather than playing ball

214
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,120
 in the spirit's leading.

215
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,160
 In the past years, depending on political sides,

216
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,760
 we have seen different people groups and nationalities

217
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,240
 and occupations fall from faith and grace

218
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,040
 because we have associated with one side of the opinion.

219
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,800
 We have consciously or unconsciously

220
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,560
 viewed these people groups and nationalities and occupations

221
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,520
 in a lesser light.

222
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
 And what this means is that by virtue,

223
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,520
 we have given up on God's very opinion about people

224
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,640
 and adopted, because we were serving our own emotions,

225
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,480
 adopted our own instead.

226
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,200
 We have become the very tall crowds

227
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,040
 that have gotten in the way of letting people see Jesus.

228
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,960
 Has that got anything to do with a healing perspective?

229
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,720
 Yep, it also applies.

230
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,920
 Even when Jesus is very powerful and Jesus is sovereign enough

231
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,480
 to decide to heal anyone at his disposal,

232
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,240
 we are supposed to be partners of Jesus.

233
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,640
 And the way that we can get in the way

234
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,400
 is that people don't want to seek healing

235
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,720
 in the first place.

236
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,200
 They're overshadowed by this social stigma and perception

237
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,360
 that they don't even want to have healing in the first place.

238
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,560
 And so today, if you just find two minutes

239
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,960
 and if you find that this really applies to you,

240
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,240
 maybe just spend two minutes with Jesus

241
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,840
 just to reclaim his opinion.

242
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,280
 It could just be like, Jesus, I know

243
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,240
 that your healing is universal and irrespective of worth.

244
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,480
 Sorry, I was wrong about this particular person or occupation

245
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,880
 or people group.

246
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,920
 And I wish to partner in your activity

247
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,920
 again of letting the person see you and your church

248
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,240
 in the right light.

249
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,600
 OK, we're going to move on.

250
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,160
 And we're going to do a little bit of forensics.

251
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,440
 We're going to do some internal investigation on Zacchaeus.

252
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,320
 We're going to investigate and name the deeper

253
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,720
 wound inside of Zacchaeus.

254
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,160
 What was the problem with Zacchaeus

255
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,520
 that had caused him to essentially turn

256
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,680
 against his own people?

257
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,800
 And as I was finding answers, I simply

258
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,240
 couldn't help but realize that Zacchaeus is actually

259
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,000
 a brother of ours.

260
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,560
 And so any speculation made against him, it has to be fair.

261
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,800
 But it also has to be for identification's sake.

262
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,600
 Identification is not judgment.

263
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,480
 Identification is saying, I can identify

264
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,000
 with this person.

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,280
 I can share in the feelings.

266
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,400
 I really understand what this person means.

267
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,480
 Because that's what Jesus's incarnation was about.

268
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,280
 Jesus came into this world, and he identified with humanity.

269
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,040
 He didn't judge humanity.

270
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,520
 God is growing a very compassionate church globally,

271
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,880
 but also here in Yuen Long.

272
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,040
 And our motives need to be holy as we probe

273
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,680
 into the lives of others.

274
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,720
 And we can start doing that in our scripture reading

275
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,080
 when we come across the tax collector, or Judas,

276
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,920
 or this person, Zacchaeus, or the Levites

277
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,600
 who passed about the Samaritans and just walked through.

278
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,280
 Actually, spend a moment just to identify with these people.

279
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,680
 Why are they doing these things instead

280
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,960
 of the normal Sunday school children's school routine?

281
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,040
 Oh, he was a baddie.

282
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,200
 He did this, and this, and that.

283
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,680
 I think that's going to nurture us

284
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,120
 into a very compassionate church that Jesus would like to see.

285
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,920
 Anyway, back to Zacchaeus, something is not quite right,

286
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,560
 not quite coherent with him internally, emotionally,

287
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,720
 morally, spiritually.

288
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,840
 And if we were using contemporary language,

289
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,560
 we're going to say he's a broken mess.

290
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,720
 How can somebody make it a living deeply hurting

291
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,960
 his own kind without feeling guilty?

292
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,640
 There are possible reasons here.

293
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,560
 Either Zacchaeus didn't regard his ways of tax

294
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,520
 collecting being wrong, which is quite doubtful because he can

295
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,640
 really read the sentiment in the room,

296
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,880
 or he wants to justify this action

297
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,240
 and rationalize this decision because people

298
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,440
 have bullied him.

299
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,760
 And so it was a time for him to dominate and assert power

300
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,840
 over those who had bullied him, or those he otherwise couldn't

301
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,240
 because of his short stature.

302
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,760
 Or possibly a third reason, and it's just indifference

303
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,040
 and apathy.

304
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,120
 Zacchaeus was so hurt that there was just

305
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,200
 a lack of moral concern over what he did.

306
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,480
 So out of all these examples, anyway,

307
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,580
 out of all these possibilities, we

308
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,560
 don't see a lot of guilt in Zacchaeus,

309
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,160
 but we see a lot of shame in Zacchaeus.

310
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,080
 Now, as Hong Kong people, we might use these words

311
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,800
 interchangeably and not knowing the difference.

312
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,200
 Pastor Tim gave some really good definitions of Brene Brown

313
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,160
 the other day.

314
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,280
 I'm not going to go and dwell on it,

315
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,600
 but I want to talk about the difference here.

316
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,200
 Different from guilt, shame actually

317
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,760
 focuses on the negative evaluation

318
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,880
 of the whole entire person rather than the single

319
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,880
 perceived offense that we do when we're guilty.

320
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,200
 And in effect, this inward turn to negative self-evaluation

321
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,520
 left Zacchaeus so stuck in a cycle of humiliation

322
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,440
 and idolatry where holding on to money and power,

323
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,480
 even at the expense of his own people,

324
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,200
 was the temporary antidote to deal

325
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,920
 with his ostracism and pain.

326
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,640
 And this is why we see people going

327
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,200
 to very obsessive and addictive regimes

328
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,320
 when they navigate around shame.

329
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,600
 And for Zacchaeus, his way of dealing with shame

330
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,720
 was to amass and accumulate wealth and power.

331
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,400
 Shame is so detrimental to a person's holistic health.

332
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,000
 It clouds out every judgment.

333
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,080
 The way we see ourselves, the way we see right and wrong,

334
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,080
 shame leads us into a life of sin, addiction,

335
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,800
 and unhealthy living.

336
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,360
 We only need to turn a few pages into the second story

337
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,680
 of the Bible, and we know that because of sin

338
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,080
 and because of rejection, Cain had turned against

339
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,120
 and actually killed his own brother, Abel.

340
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,320
 Shame leaves us so isolated from God and others,

341
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,360
 and it is so dangerous because we were never

342
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,160
 called to be on our own.

343
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,920
 We were called in the first place

344
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,600
 to be in a loving community, just like our triune God.

345
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,880
 So at the very beginning, I shared a little bit

346
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,040
 about my condition.

347
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,280
 And for some of you who don't know,

348
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
 or the many of you who don't know,

349
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,640
 I have lived with eczema for the majority of my life.

350
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,040
 And when we say chronic, what we mean

351
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,280
 is that the condition is long lasting.

352
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,640
 It doesn't really have a cure to.

353
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,000
 And for the longest time, I've prayed against it.

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,480
 I've prayed for it to go away.

355
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,960
 And we know with eczema, if you know about eczema,

356
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,720
 it doesn't really fall off.

357
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,360
 If you pass adolescence age and you still have eczema,

358
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,680
 you pretty much have eczema, and you can expect

359
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,760
 to have eczema forever.

360
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,360
 And I prayed for it to go away because it has

361
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,160
 all sorts of problems in me--

362
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,920
 the pain, the sleepless nights, the itch, very itchy skin,

363
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
 and attributing to all these problems,

364
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,840
 I actually also carried a lot of shame in me.

365
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,040
 If you think about the names and the labels

366
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,840
 that I had when I was in school from teasing schoolmates,

367
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,280
 if you think about my daily commute to work

368
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,080
 or to the groceries, and I was always

369
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,200
 hoping that I'm not getting stared at for shedding off

370
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
 my flakes.

371
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,680
 To the people, maybe even you guys who really love me

372
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,120
 and yet still fail to understand why this guy can't

373
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,080
 stop itching.

374
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,640
 And so all these kind of things and experience and events

375
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,800
 just spiraled off to shame, and it also

376
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,500
 spiraled off to a lot of unhealthy living inside of me.

377
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,120
 I remembered a time in my undergraduate--

378
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,760
 and there was one year in my undergraduate university life

379
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,040
 where my attendance was at a mere 4%.

380
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,720
 Think about it.

381
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,760
 I remember that year so clearly.

382
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,440
 Not actually sure when it was day or night

383
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,360
 because I had my curtains shut.

384
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,840
 And it didn't really matter anyway

385
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,160
 because I wasn't turning up to lectures.

386
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
 But this pain and this shame just

387
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,080
 led me into just hiding in my dormitory,

388
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,680
 just binging on the screen or binging on movies and games.

389
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,480
 And after that, I would just fall back into sleep,

390
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,160
 and it just rinses and repeats.

391
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,960
 What I didn't know, why God didn't take away

392
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,720
 the physical healing, although I was blaming him

393
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
 on the physical healing, I even told him,

394
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,480
 hey, couldn't you just give me a condition that

395
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,760
 isn't shown outside, in the outside?

396
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,880
 But what I didn't know is that God actually

397
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,360
 wants to do a deeper healing in me.

398
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,640
 And without that experience all till today,

399
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,280
 I wouldn't have received such deeper holistic healing.

400
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,520
 And I would have just sufficed on maybe a clear skin.

401
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,640
 And maybe internally, I would still have a very poor image

402
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,880
 about myself.

403
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,880
 So we know that shame has such a negative impact on us.

404
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,280
 So what are we to do?

405
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,440
 Wretch people that we are.

406
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
 Paul says, wretch people that we are.

407
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,560
 What can we do?

408
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,320
 Thankfully, that's the wrong question

409
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,040
 to be asking because it's not something that we can do.

410
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,880
 And it is only Jesus who could do something and save us

411
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,680
 from this problem.

412
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,800
 On our own, we can't come out of shame.

413
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,480
 And we see this clearly here in the slide.

414
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,800
 It is Jesus who initiates Zacchaeus in this story.

415
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,800
 It is he who came to seek and to save the lost.

416
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,000
 It is he who must enter our empty and lonely homes

417
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,280
 and to get rid of the shame off of us.

418
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,640
 So in the Bible, there are actually two ways

419
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,040
 where Jesus deals with shame.

420
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,400
 The first one we can see here, Jesus

421
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,600
 is repeatedly portrayed as somebody

422
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,520
 who refuses to buy into the culture of shame.

423
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,840
 He befriended those whose society labeled as sinners.

424
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,440
 He defied social customs around the notion of who's holy

425
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
 and who isn't holy.

426
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,280
 He pronounced God's blessing upon those

427
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,000
 who had been stigmatized.

428
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
 He also tells a lot of parables and stories

429
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,600
 about people with no social standing or religious standing

430
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,440
 being ushered into God's kingdom and presence.

431
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,040
 And this is the story that we see.

432
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,080
 This is one way of Jesus dealing with shame.

433
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,480
 Moreover, Jesus deals with our shame by carrying it.

434
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,920
 When Jesus faced death by crucifixion,

435
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,520
 by dying on the cross, he was publicly

436
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,520
 shamed in every possible way.

437
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
 He was stripped naked.

438
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
 He was mocked.

439
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,520
 He was physically abused.

440
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,840
 He was labeled a blasphemer and a traitor.

441
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,120
 He was nailed onto a cross.

442
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,120
 And the biblical accounts of Jesus's death

443
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,160
 attach great significance to the fact of this public shaming.

444
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,120
 Because Jesus was, in a sense, carrying this shame

445
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,440
 on our behalf and in our place, shared the burden of this shame.

446
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,240
 And in bearing this, he had robbed the power of shame.

447
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,320
 Such a debilitating power, he robbed it away

448
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,440
 through carrying it for us.

449
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,640
 And this is why Apostle Paul would later say, "From now on,

450
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,960
 and therefore, we don't see anyone

451
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,760
 from a human point of view.

452
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,400
 For in Christ, there is a new creation."

453
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,360
 That's a verse that we always go back to whenever

454
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,440
 somebody is baptized.

455
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,880
 And I was just wondering, are we seeing ourselves

456
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,720
 in a human point of view here?

457
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,160
 Brothers and sisters, are you seeing each other?

458
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,240
 This is the best place to learn about this.

459
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,000
 Are we seeing ourselves in a person point of view,

460
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,960
 in a flesh point of view?

461
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,120
 Or in Christ, a new creation point of view?

462
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,640
 Husbands and wives, are you doing the same in your houses?

463
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,880
 Are you looking at each other as new creations?

464
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,520
 So when sin and shame and all sorts of deep wounds abound,

465
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,520
 we can know that God's grace abounds even more.

466
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,000
 I'm borrowing Paul's language here.

467
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,280
 Experiencing such profound acceptance and healing

468
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,280
 from Jesus, there's only one appropriate response.

469
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,040
 And the response is one of repentance.

470
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,760
 We might like to think of repentance

471
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,120
 as somebody goes off their very high horse,

472
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,920
 saying sorry for what they've done,

473
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,800
 an offense that they have created or made.

474
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,400
 But that's only repentance in part.

475
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,840
 Repentance, if we go back to the original language,

476
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,640
 means turning towards God, a turn towards God,

477
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,160
 and also another turn, a turning away from wrongdoing.

478
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,600
 And Psaki has fully embodied repentance

479
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,000
 because firstly, he turned to Jesus.

480
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,640
 Look, Jesus.

481
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
 He said that.

482
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,200
 But he also turns into his actions later on.

483
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,320
 So essentially, he's saying, look, Jesus,

484
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,720
 I've put a lot of emphasis in finding security and comfort

485
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,960
 in holding and amassing this money and power.

486
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,280
 And that is idolatry.

487
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,600
 I should be seeking that comfort and healing and security in you.

488
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,320
 And yet, I've looked on it.

489
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,880
 I try to look for it in money and power.

490
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,720
 And so letting go of these idols,

491
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,160
 it also means that he is seeing Jesus in a new light

492
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,080
 with worship and with praise.

493
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,240
 The turning in repentance also means turning away

494
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,360
 from wrongdoing, as I said.

495
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,560
 And as I said, with shame, there's

496
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,360
 not much we could do in our own selves, this negative feeling.

497
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,200
 But if we have guilt instead, there's

498
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,920
 something that we can do.

499
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,960
 As long as we are turning Godward,

500
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,960
 there is a positive effect, feeling guilty sometimes.

501
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,480
 And it is for our repentance.

502
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,520
 The feeling of guilt, if we are turned Godward,

503
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,920
 it can potentially lead us to wanting

504
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,160
 to make up for the offense.

505
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,440
 And for Zacchaeus, to make up, it

506
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,280
 means to make up the broken relationships that he

507
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,160
 has with his own countrymen.

508
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,000
 Regardless of what is perceived of him, what

509
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,160
 was said and done to him, Zacchaeus

510
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,400
 initiates and he lets go of escalating this old offense

511
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,840
 with a 180 degree turn.

512
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,080
 He turns money extorting into charity giving.

513
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,600
 And such radical liberation is found

514
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,720
 in a man who is met by the love of Jesus

515
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,520
 and healed from of his inner wounds.

516
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,080
 In the end, Jesus leaves no room for doubt.

517
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,160
 There was no second guessing on where Zacchaeus now

518
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,080
 fares in Jesus' eyes, in God's eyes.

519
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,720
 If Zacchaeus was still unsure the moment Jesus locked eyes

520
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,560
 with him, called him down the tree, called his name,

521
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,080
 and without any upfront judgment to say that he

522
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,520
 has to go to his house, by verse 9,

523
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,280
 Zacchaeus could put this to bed.

524
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,720
 He can put this doubt to bed.

525
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,640
 Jesus really loves him.

526
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,360
 And if we were to paraphrase verse 9,

527
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,240
 I would paraphrase it this way, that Jesus just

528
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,720
 assured Zacchaeus that he is one who belongs to him.

529
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:36,240
 So I wonder whether we can leave today's message knowing

530
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,480
 that God also has assurance for us.

531
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,920
 No matter how we deem and evaluate our own selves,

532
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,320
 no matter what we think of in terms of our distance from God,

533
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,600
 or no matter what we've done, actually, last year, last month,

534
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,760
 or last week, regardless of all this,

535
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,600
 we can know that Jesus is very close to us.

536
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,440
 Or in a healing perspective, regardless

537
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,280
 of whether we are cured, regardless of whether we're

538
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,440
 waiting on healing, regardless of whether healing has not

539
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,840
 come yet, or for those who have given up on healing altogether,

540
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,200
 Jesus gives his assurance today that he is very close to us.

541
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,160
 And that is his estimation.

542
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,240
 And we better ought to start applying that estimation

543
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,200
 on ourselves as well.

544
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,200
 God brings his final verdict.

545
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,080
 And it's not because of what we have done,

546
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,000
 but because of what Jesus had accomplished

547
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,560
 in his humanity and divinity.

548
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,400
 Can I welcome the band up again?

549
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,440
 I just want to do a bit of ministry time.

550
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,560
 So as you guys get ready, can we all

551
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,320
 stand as we go into a time of ministry?

552
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,560
 So with the message that we just preached,

553
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,680
 I'm mindful that there are a few ways that we can actually

554
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,120
 go about this.

555
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,360
 Maybe there are friends here who are yet to be Christians.

556
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,240
 Jesus wants us to know that he is very close to us.

557
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,800
 And despite our brokenness, he insists

558
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,080
 on knocking on that heart door and hoping

559
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,360
 to come into your homes, your heart homes.

560
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,640
 And so like Zacchaeus' story, I wonder

561
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,480
 whether we could, in repentance, start a relationship with him

562
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,040
 today.

563
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,160
 It could just be, sorry, God, for the things

564
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,040
 that I've done up to this point, the sins that I've committed.

565
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,720
 Thank you for loving me in such a way so that I am one of yours.

566
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,160
 I am a child of God.

567
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,540
 And then for those of us who are in Christ,

568
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,280
 we can also have a moment welcoming Jesus

569
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,200
 through our repentance.

570
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,660
 First, we are going to turn to God.

571
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,680
 And then we're going to talk about some of the wrongdoings

572
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,920
 that we might have committed.

573
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,640
 Notice that repentance isn't just the moment

574
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,840
 that we get saved, the sinner prayer,

575
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,560
 but repentance is this every frequent now and again thing

576
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,560
 that we do every so often for discipleship, for healing.

577
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,440
 We know that God has a very longstanding care and affection

578
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,400
 for us.

579
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,100
 And we can trust that actually in the repentance,

580
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,980
 there's also healing that is coming through.

581
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,320
 When we lock eyes with Jesus and we hold on to that loving gaze,

582
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,520
 we know that we are far from his standards.

583
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,360
 And there is some shame and there are some guilts

584
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,960
 that he wants us to address.

585
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,760
 So firstly, it's the shame.

586
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,200
 God, I'm just so sorry for not seeing myself

587
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,000
 in the way in the estimation that you see me.

588
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,320
 Notice that I can't take this away.

589
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,200
 Notice shame.

590
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,660
 It's just so detrimental to me and that you

591
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,600
 need to take it away.

592
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,160
 Lord, would you let me see the new creation in me?

593
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,960
 And now God wants to address our guilt as well.

594
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,960
 Jesus, I'm so sorry for the things that I've done

595
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,440
 and also the things that I've not done,

596
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,560
 which I know that I shouldn't be doing or I should be doing.

597
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,400
 And the gift that you've given us

598
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,200
 allows us to know right and wrong.

599
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,680
 Lord, I want to hold on to that, hone in, and really use it

600
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,320
 as my compass again.

601
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,040
 Lord, I obviously, through these offenses and these wrongdoings,

602
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,360
 I've also mucked up in some relationships.

603
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,480
 And I need you to heal me.

604
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,080
 And I need you to lead in these relationships.

605
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,600
 And I need you, Holy Spirit, to give me a new revelation

606
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,000
 how to lead me in these new relationships.

607
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,240
 So we're going to pray.

608
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,640
 And we're going to talk about these three things, OK?

609
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,120
 Everybody, let's join.

610
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,280
 Let's not just leave it to non-Christians

611
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:20,040
 to do this welcoming Jesus in our life prayer.

612
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,720
 So if you repeat after me, Heavenly Father,

613
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,160
 thank you for loving us.

614
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,760
 Thank you that you have met with me today again.

615
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:38,080
 And I know that you're knocking on my door.

616
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,960
 So I just wish to fall into your lap.

617
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,160
 I want to start a relationship with you.

618
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
 I also want to confess my sins.

619
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,360
 Notice I've done something that I'm not proud of.

620
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:09,400
 But in your loving and forgiving,

621
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,640
 I know that I am a child of God.

622
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,240
 And so I want to thank you for letting

623
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,640
 me become your own children.

624
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,080
 OK.

625
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:27,680
 And if we follow after me again to address those categories

626
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,640
 again, the shame and the guilt. Father,

627
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,400
 I have such a poor image of my own self.

628
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,120
 If you do.

629
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:42,480
 Lord, I try to use other ways to navigate around this.

630
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,720
 But it's always temporary.

631
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,640
 And so Lord, would you remind me of how you take away our shame?

632
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:03,040
 So that I can see myself in a new light.

633
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:14,080
 Thank you for dying on the cross for me, bearing my shame.

634
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,440
 And it is no longer for me to carry.

635
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,720
 Father, I'm also guilty.

636
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:28,400
 I've hurted others.

637
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,840
 I've done something wrong.

638
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,600
 Lord, thank you for the fact that I know that I've

639
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,480
 done something wrong here.

640
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,440
 The fact that I know that I've done something wrong.

641
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,400
 Lord, I want to turn to you and turn away

642
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,560
 from these wrongdoings.

643
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:58,440
 Install a new law in me so that I don't need

644
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,720
 to do these things anymore.

645
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:10,320
 And Lord, if there is anything that I've mucked up,

646
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,440
 Lord, would you restore them?

647
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,480
 Especially relationships, because they

648
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,800
 matter to you the most.

649
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:29,200
 Would you lead me in these relationships

650
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,240
 as we see healing come through?

651
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:37,320
 In Jesus' name we pray.

652
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,800
 Amen.

653
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,640
 (water splashing)
