1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Thank you, thank you so much, Tim. Thank you, everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 I'm so happy to be back in Yuen Long.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 I don't come as often as I want,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 but every time I come, it seems to have changed,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 a lot more new people, so I'm really excited to be here.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Today, I am going to continue in the series that you've been in,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 and the title of the message is

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 "Are you willing healing in community?"

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I'm going to first start and talk about a story about

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 when we got COVID. How many people can relate?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Okay, so most of you didn't get COVID.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Anyway, COVID started in 2020, as we all well know,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 and my family and I, like most people, did everything not to get it,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 especially in Hong Kong, right?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 You didn't want to get it, you didn't want to go to quarantine,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 you didn't want to be isolated,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 and we were successful until 2023, last year.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Just before everything was lifted, we got COVID.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 In 2022, I was pregnant, so I didn't want to get COVID

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 because that would have been a disaster,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 but God was faithful, He kept us without COVID until last year.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 The whole family got COVID, and our helper was very sick,

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 my kids were sick, we were all sick,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 but my husband was testing negative, so he had to go to work.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 (laughter)

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So I remained with the whole family, our helper was very sick,

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 so she couldn't do anything.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Even though I was sick, I had to be the strong one

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 and take care of my children and take care of the helper, right?

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And because we couldn't see anyone, I really felt overwhelmed.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I remember on day two, I felt overwhelmed, I felt like crying,

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 and for the very rare times, I felt sorry for myself.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I felt isolated, I felt like nobody was there to help me,

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 and I just felt helpless at that time.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 So I know many of you have got similar stories,

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 maybe even worse stories, right?

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Maybe some of you were isolated for longer, for us it was seven days,

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 maybe for you it was 14 days, 21 days, or even longer during that period.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 This actually made me realize how relational we are.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I'm an introvert, by the way, but we are still very relational people.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 So I'm going to read today from Mark 1, verse 44,

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 and it says, "A man with leprosy came to him and begged and came to Jesus."

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 So when it's saying him, it came to Jesus.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 "A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 'If you are willing, you can make me clean.' Jesus was indignant.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 He reached out his hand and touched the man.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 'I am willing,' he said. 'Be clean.'

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 'See that you don't tell this to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest,

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing as a testimony to them.'"

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 In this passage, we see a man with leprosy.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 In the Bible, this was a chronic infectious disease, and it was incurable.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Because of its devastating effects on the skin,

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 leprosy in the Bible was feared as much as COVID or more.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And you can imagine, because the people with leprosy would probably have it for years.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And in the Bible, in Leviticus 13, verse 45 to 46,

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 it describes how lepers were required to stay outside the camp

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 and cover their mouths to say that we are unclean.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Now, I was feeling overwhelmed, and I was feeling so sad,

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 with seven days of separation and isolation.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Now, imagine a person with leprosy.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Not only were they separated from everybody else in society,

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 but they were separated from their own family.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I was feeling sorry for myself, and I was separated with my family.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Now, imagine a person with leprosy.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 They were not allowed to contact anyone as long as they had that disease.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 You were unclean as long as you had the disease,

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 but afterwards, you would go through a purification process

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 and verification process with the priest.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 That's why Jesus said, "Go and show yourself to the priest."

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 He had to fulfill the whole purification process.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 When you had leprosy, it didn't only affect your body,

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 but it affected you emotionally.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 You were not supposed to be close to anybody,

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 so you were not interacting emotionally with anybody.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 You were not allowed to work, so it affected your livelihood.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 In fact, it affected every area of your life--

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 your social life, your health, your livelihood, your emotions.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 It was not just the physical.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 So when we read this passage, sometimes we just think of the disease.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 But like my experience with COVID, it comes with a whole lot of other things.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 When Jesus touched this man and restored his health,

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 he also healed him emotionally.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 He healed him socially. He healed him financially.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Jesus restored this man back to community

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 because he was willing to reach out and touch someone society said should not be touched.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Today, we are saying, "Are you willing?"

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Jesus is willing.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 In this place, maybe there are people here who feel isolated.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 In any one of those areas, maybe emotionally you feel isolated.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Maybe financially you feel isolated.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Maybe socially you feel isolated.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 In whatever way you feel isolated today,

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Jesus is willing to touch you in those areas.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 In the passage above, we see that the man with leprosy had to go to Jesus.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Jesus was willing to touch him, but the man had to be willing to seek out Jesus.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 I believe we are all willing here because we've come only for that name,

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 for the name of Jesus. Amen.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 So Jesus is willing, but are we willing?

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 A lot of the time, sometimes we isolate ourselves

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 and we don't reach out to Jesus for different reasons.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Sometimes we are so scared that what if nothing happens?

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Sometimes a lot of things block us from reaching out to Jesus.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 But today my question is, are you willing to reach out?

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Some of us here are feeling lonely or isolated,

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 and Jesus is willing to touch us.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 We need to break down the walls we have built around us

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 and allow Jesus and other people in.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Today, COVID may be over, but there are many other things

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 that isolate us from community and finding our healing there.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 When God made us, he made us in his likeness,

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 and God by nature is relational.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 We were never meant to live in isolation or loneliness.

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 God's heart is that everyone who is isolated in any way,

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 whether physically, socially, emotionally, and mentally,

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 is restored back to him and back to community.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 The loneliness statistics after COVID are staggering.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 I mean, when I was looking after at these statistics,

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 they are staggering, especially for Gen Z.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I don't know if everybody knows who Gen Z are.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Okay, Gen Z is the generation--I think it ends 2012,

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 those born 2012, between about, I think, maybe 1990 to 2012.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 That's Gen Z. Anyone here in Gen Z?

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Oh, wow. Okay. Not as many. Okay.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I'm not Gen Z, by the way.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 1990 to 2012, my daughter is Gen Z.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And in this generation, it's the most hard hit

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 because the statistics say loneliness is at its peak

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 between the ages of 18 and 30,

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 with 30% to 50% of this age group feeling lonely.

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 The effects of isolation of COVID are still being felt,

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 whether emotionally, mentally, or even in physical health.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 God says the lonely in families.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 This is Psalm 68, verse 6.

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 It says, "God says the lonely in families.

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 He leads out the prisoners with singing,

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land."

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 He places the lonely in families because this is God's heart.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 He wants everybody who feels lonely to be in a family.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 And you being in this church, it means if you are in this church,

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 or you want to join this church, this is your spiritual family.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 God has led you to be in this family, so you are not lonely.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 I'm going to read from 1 Kings 19, verse 15 to 18, and it says,

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 "The Lord said to him, 'Go back to where you came from.'"

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Here we're talking about Elijah.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 "The Lord said to him, 'Go back the way you came,

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 and go to the desert of Damascus.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Also anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel,

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel,

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000

 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

466
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 and anoint Jehu son of Shaphat from Abel,

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 and the community group I spoke about earlier.

468
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 There are times I've also prayed for other people.

469
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 There are times I've also been strong spiritually.

470
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 There are times I've also spoken into people's lives.

471
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 In those times, it doesn't mean we will always get everything right,

472
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 and we will have conflicts sometimes,

473
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 but it means we believe we all have good intentions

474
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 and truly want the best for each other.

475
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Needs are different, and we won't always have the answers for everyone,

476
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 and thank God we don't have to because God does have the answers.

477
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 But we have to be willing to be that place where people can come to,

478
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 and not just people who have it all together.

479
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 We have to be willing to be that place where the broken come to.

480
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 We have to be willing to be the place where the vulnerable come to.

481
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 We have to be willing.

482
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Sorry, I get emotional when I think of this.

483
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 We have to be willing to be the place where the lonely come to.

484
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 We have to be willing to be the place where the marginalized come to.

485
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 This is not just the place where people who have it all together come to.

486
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 We have to be open and see the people society shuns.

487
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 We have to see them because a lot of the time it's hard to see those people.

488
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 It's hard to see the people that God wants us to touch

489
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 because they're hiding in the shadows because they've been shunned by society.

490
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 We have to be willing to be those people.

491
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 The widows, the orphans, the widowers, those who are sick,

492
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 those who are marginalized, those in need.

493
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 We have to reach out if we are willing.

494
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Sometimes they won't come, so we take the steps to step out

495
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 and touch those like Jesus did.

496
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 It takes a deliberate act and a willing heart

497
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 to reach out to those in society who need it the most.

498
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Jesus, when he was on earth,

499
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 he deliberately sought out those who were marginalized like in Mark 1.

500
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Those who were sick, those whose society shunned,

501
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 to be low, to be more like Christ.

502
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 It's to do the same.

503
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 We need to love like Jesus.

504
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 We need to let the love of God flow through us to those around us.

505
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 It is through God's love that we are able to reach others in need and community.

506
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 We need God's love.

507
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 We need to reach out.

508
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 You know, the Bible says, "They shall know you for your love for one another."

509
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 We start here in community, here in the church,

510
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 love for one another, meeting each other's needs.

511
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Then we go out there and they see the love.

512
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 They see the love in our hearts.

513
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 That's how they'll be able to tell the difference.

514
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Through our love, through our love for each other.

515
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Today I want to pray for us.

516
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 And I really sense the first thing I want to pray today,

517
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 and I'm going to ask us to all stand.

518
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 The first thing I want to pray for today,

519
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 I really sense that there are a lot of people who are saying,

520
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 "I need the love first in order for me to give out that love.

521
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 I need that love first."

522
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 So I don't know where you are, but if you're comfortable, if you can open your hands.

523
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 You're saying, "I need that love.

524
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 I want God to pour out that love in me first.

525
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 I need that love to heal me."

526
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 It says, the word says, "Perfect love casts out fear."

527
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Fear of being in community, fear of being that community.

528
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 God's perfect love casts out that fear.

529
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Today I want to first pray for that love.

530
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Oh Lord, you're such a loving God.

531
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 You're such a loving God.

532
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Through your love, you heal.

533
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Through your love, you heal us, Lord.

534
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Today I just want to pray, Lord, that you would touch

535
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 each and every person who needs your love this morning.

536
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Pour out your love today.

537
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Pour out your love today.

538
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Pour out your love today.

539
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Oh, to overflowing Lord, that we may be that community that people need.

540
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 There is so much need in the community, my God.

541
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 There is so much need.

542
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 But Father, I pray that you would heal us to be able to heal other people.

543
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Because healed people are so grateful and they reach out and heal others, Lord.

544
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I pray that you would create communities in this church, Lord,

545
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 that will be able to help each other, bring each other closer to you,

546
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 heal each other in the name of Jesus.

547
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I pray, Lord, that we become the communities that are not just closed up

548
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 because now we're healed, but we become the communities that are open

549
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 and begin to see the vulnerable people in community, Lord.

550
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 I pray that people begin to know that this is a church full of your love

551
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 and they are drawn to you.

552
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 They are drawn to you, Lord, in this place.

553
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 I pray, Father, that you would bring, bring, bring all the people who need healing in this place.

554
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Bring all the vulnerable people in this place.

555
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 May we not shun people of any kind, my God.

556
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 I pray that you would draw people to yourself in this place

557
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 and people's hearts will be ready in here to receive the people you send

558
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 in the name of Jesus.

559
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 I pray for healing of relationships in this place.

560
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 I pray for healing in community, my God.

561
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 I pray for healing for anyone who's been hurt in this community.

562
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 I pray for healing for people who've been hurt in their families.

563
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Maybe there was no love in the family.

564
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Father, I pray for that healing in Jesus' name.

565
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 You're a God who loves and I pray that you would pour out your love

566
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 into each and every person who needs that love today in the name of Jesus.

567
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Maybe some people have felt marginalized even in this place.

568
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Father, I pray that you would break down every wall and every barrier

569
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 and everything that separates people in this place in Jesus' name.

570
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Father, people have been even hurt maybe in the city.

571
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Father, I pray for your healing balm over every single person in this place.

572
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Father, touch each heart, Lord.

573
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 You came to heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds in Jesus' name.

574
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 I thank you for your healing, Lord.

575
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 I thank you for your healing in this place.

576
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 I thank you for your healing in this place.

577
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Thank you, Holy Spirit.

578
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 That you're even speaking to people in here about the communities they should join.

579
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Thank you, Holy Spirit.

580
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 You're touching the hearts of people in this place.

581
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 I thank you, Holy Spirit.

582
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 I thank you, Holy Spirit.

583
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Today, I want to challenge us to find someone

584
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 whether in this place or elsewhere, I challenge us to find someone to speak to today.

585
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Ask them how they're really doing.

586
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Sometimes we come to church and we put a facade that everything is okay

587
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 when everything is not okay.

588
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 We say, "How are you doing?" We smile and we say, "I'm okay."

589
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 But inside, we're not okay.

590
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 But today, I want us to go to someone

591
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 with the intention of finding out how they're really doing.

592
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 How they're really doing.

593
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Let us be willing to open up and say how we're really doing.

594
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 If you're tired, say, "I'm tired."

595
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 If you're stressed, say, "I'm stressed." Please pray for me.

596
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 If you're overwhelmed, say, "I'm overwhelmed." This is what's going on.

597
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Let's be willing to listen to people.

598
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Let's be willing to be that place.

599
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Sometimes just listening brings the healing.

600
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Somebody just needs that listening ear.

601
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Let's be willing today to be those people

602
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 as we become the community that heals each other through the grace of God.

603
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 So Father, we thank you for this healing series.

604
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 We thank you, Lord, for each and every person that's in this room.

605
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 For each and every person that spoke.

606
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 All the pieces to the puzzles that have come together.

607
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Father, we thank you.

608
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 For each and every person you've used, we thank you.

609
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 We thank you even for Pastors Tim and Ivan.

610
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 We thank you for Pastors Chapman.

611
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 We thank you for each and every person.

612
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 We thank you for every volunteer, every full-time staff.

613
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 We thank you for each and every person who comes to the prayer.

614
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Every person who serves on a Sunday.

615
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Every person who is contributing to the community

616
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 that is bringing healing to others in this place.

617
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 We thank you for every community group leader.

618
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 All the sacrifice that they bring.

619
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 We thank you, Lord, for each and every person

620
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 who has reached out to somebody in need in this place.

621
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 We thank you, Lord, for those you have sent out in this place

622
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 to bring healing to other people.

623
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 We thank you that you're strengthening them.

624
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 We thank you that you are even bringing healing to them that they need.

625
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 We pray for physical healing.

626
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 We pray for emotional healing.

627
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 We pray for financial healing.

628
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 We pray, Lord, for each and every type of healing in the name of Jesus,

629
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 even socially those who feel isolated.

630
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 We pray, Lord, that you would heal them too,

631
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 that they may be able to do more work out there in the name of Jesus.

632
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Father, increase your healing in this place in the name of Jesus.

633
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 We thank you, Lord, and we bless your name in Jesus' name.

634
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Amen.

635
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 What a powerful message.

636
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And as a response, I just want to sing this song

637
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 so that we really make room in our hearts for the Holy Spirit to work in us.

638
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 And for those that are in need,

639
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 may we just surrender to God's inkling on our hearts

640
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 and be obedient to what the Holy Spirit says.

641
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,360
