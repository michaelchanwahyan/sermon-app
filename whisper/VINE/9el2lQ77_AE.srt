1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
 Imagine with me for a moment a church.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,440
 This is not a church in the singular, on its own and distinct, but a church in the plural,

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,000
 united across a nation, joined in purpose, focused on building up God's kingdom one

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,540
 life at a time.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,900
 It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA the grand narrative of the redemptive

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,640
 story of Jesus Christ, and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,960
 brings.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,160
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building, but actively engaged in the

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,160
 community it is planted in, desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,400
 soil.

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,800
 A church that sees salvation as holistic, transforming God's people for God's work

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,600
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart to the poor, the weak, the oppressed

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,680
 and the persecuted.

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,760
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family as integral to all that it's called

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:19,060
 to be and do, involving intentional, committed and authentic relationships across all levels.

16
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,040
 It is the sort of place where both the young and the old feel cared for, supported and

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
 equipped.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,960
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions come to feel at home, a cultural

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,000
 mosaic that honors and embraces a richness in diversity that marks us as the body of

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,200
 Christ.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,540
 It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively, reflecting the

22
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,880
 boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,240
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God and passionate to see this

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,280
 invade all aspects of their lives, where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,320
 faith rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

26
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,320
 A church that does not make its Sunday services the exclamation mark of its existence, but

27
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:20,120
 instead the comma in its ongoing sentence, a time of service, love and engagement that

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,400
 inspires and emboldens all equally for the conversation that lies ahead.

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,720
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

30
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,920
 This is our city.

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,240
 This is our church.

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,000
 This is our home.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Good morning everyone and welcome to the Christmas Day service.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 It's so good to have you.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,540
 We have lots of reason to be thankful and joyful.

36
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,840
 We have a lot of exciting things planned, but before we do that, I want to invite you

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,600
 to turn to your neighbor and say Merry Christmas.

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,080
 Yes, Merry Christmas everyone.

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:10,640
 Well, I want to invite everyone to stand and I'll pray for us and then we'll sing joyful

40
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
 Christmas songs.

41
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
 Let me pray.

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,960
 Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for sending Jesus.

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,720
 Jesus, we thank you for coming to us because you love us to rescue us, to show us your

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,200
 love, to lay down your life for us so that we can have joy, that we can know you.

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,160
 And today we just want to lift up these songs and give you praise and say thank you Jesus

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
 for coming.

47
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,800
 Thank you that you love us.

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,520
 Thank you that you give us new life and that we can know that.

49
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,280
 Thank you that you give us peace that we can experience.

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,280
 So we pray all this in your name, Jesus. Amen.

51
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,280
 The herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king.

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,280
 Peace on earth and mercy wild.

53
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,280
 God and sinners red with blood.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:21,280
 The herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king.

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:30,280
 Joy the triumph of the skies with the jubilant hosts proclaim.

56
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,280
 Christ is born in Bethlehem.

57
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:45,280
 Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king.

58
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:55,280
 Christ my highest heaven adored.

59
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,280
 Christ the everlasting Lord.

60
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,280
 All on high behold him come.

61
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,280
 Offspring of the Virgin's womb.

62
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,280
 Held in flesh the Godhead see.

63
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,280
 Held in mind a deity.

64
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,280
 Christ the Spirit meant to dwell.

65
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,280
 Jesus our Emmanuel.

66
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:34,280

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,780
 Day and night.

185
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,780
 Night and day.

186
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,780
 Let it sense to rise.

187
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,280
 Day and night.

188
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,780
 Night and day.

189
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,280
 Let it sense to rise.

190
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,780
 Day and night.

191
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,780
 Night and day.

192
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,280
 You are worthy of it all.

193
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:36,280
 Oh, you are worthy of it all.

194
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:43,280
 For from you are all things.

195
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,280
 And to you are all things.

196
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,780
 You deserve the glory.

197
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
 Let's sing it out.

198
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,280
 Just the voices.

199
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,780
 You are worthy of it all.

200
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:01,780
 You are worthy of it all.

201
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,280
 Worthy God.

202
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,780
 For from you are all things.

203
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,280
 And to you are all things.

204
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
 You deserve the glory.

205
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:28,780
 Yes, Jesus, you are worthy of it all.

206
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,780
 We praise you and we thank you that you have come because you

207
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,780
 love us, to rescue us, to give us new life,

208
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,280
 to put us on a different trajectory,

209
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,280
 to give peace where there was no peace,

210
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
 to give hope where we had lost hope,

211
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,780
 to give comfort where we felt like nobody could comfort us,

212
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,280
 and also to remove any shame that we are carrying.

213
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,780
 So we thank you for your love.

214
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,280
 We celebrate you today on Christmas that you have come,

215
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,780
 which is the greatest sign of love.

216
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,780
 So we pray all this in your name, Jesus.

217
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
 Amen.

218
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,780
 [applause]

219
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,780
 Good morning.

220
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,780
 You may all have a seat.

221
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,780
 You may all have a seat.

222
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,280
 So I know that last time when Pastor Tim preached,

223
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 he gave you guys a pop quiz.

224
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,780
 And I'm just going to follow up that tradition and give you guys

225
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,280
 a pop quiz as well, okay?

226
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,780
 I know that last time Pastor Tim gave you guys a pop quiz,

227
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,780
 and so here it is.

228
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,280
 How many sheep were there when the angel showed up to the

229
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
 shepherds?

230
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,280
 How many were there?

231
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
 Take a guess, take a guess.

232
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,280
 99, I heard someone say.

233
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
 Three, three.

234
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,780
 Any other guesses?

235
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,280
 How many?

236
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
 Five, five, five.

237
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,280
 Okay, so in a minute you are going to hear very biblically

238
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,780
 correct -- no, I'm joking, no.

239
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,280
 You are going to watch a really excellent performance by our

240
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
 fantastic kids at K4C.

241
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
 Let's give them a round of applause first.

242
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,280
 [applause]

243
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,280
 They have worked really hard, so during the show,

244
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,780
 please sing along with them, please clap along with them,

245
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,780
 give them the encouragement that they deserve.

246
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
 And I hope that whatever happens,

247
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,280
 we're all going to have a great time.

248
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,280
 And now, without further ado, let's introduce our amazing kids.

249
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:36,280
 [applause]

250
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
 Greetings all.

251
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
 Now please take a seat.

252
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,280
 We'd like to give you a small Christmas treat.

253
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
 This play is about Christmas.

254
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
 We'll do it in a rhyme.

255
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,280
 Some people have lines while others will rhyme.

256
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
 So don't forget cameras.

257
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,280
 Please take a snap and always remember to sing with us and clap.

258
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,280
 Our play will begin with a girl who's called Mary,

259
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,280
 a lovely girl who heard something scary.

260
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,280
 [baby crying]

261
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,280
 Mary, you are going to have a baby boy,

262
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,280
 and you will call him Jesus.

263
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,280
 Wow, what an exciting day.

264
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:21,280
 [laughter]

265
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,280
 Meanwhile, Caesar and Rome made a decree.

266
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
 You must all go home.

267
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,280
 For Joseph this month off to Bethlehem town,

268
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,280
 so they rode on their donkey all the way down.

269
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,280
 Everyone has to go back to their hometown.

270
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,280
 [applause]

271
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
 Where's the star?

272
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,280
 There's supposed to be a star, right?

273
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,280
 When they got to Bethlehem, the birth day was looming,

274
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,280
 but they couldn't find any hotel with a room in.

275
00:20:49,280 --> 00:21:13,280
 [background chatter]

276
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
 Do you have any room?

277
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:24,280
 My brother has a room.

278
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:36,280
 You can stay in my stable.

279
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,280
 He's here, Joseph said, and Jesus was born in a cold,

280
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:46,280
 cattled shed.

281
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:56,280
 [singing]

282
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:06,280

283
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:16,280

284
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:31,280

285
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:38,280
 [applause]

286
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,280
 So now we see heavenly angels appear to shepherds

287
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,280
 who were worried and shaking with fear.

288
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,280
 The angel said, hurry, I bring you good news.

289
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
 Quickly, get moving.

290
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:57,280
 No time for a snooze.

291
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,280
 I bring you good news.

292
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,280
 Today in Bethlehem Jesus is born.

293
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:14,280
 You will find him in a manger.

294
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,280
 Glory to God.

295
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,280
 Glory to God and peace on earth.

296
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:43,280
 [applause]

297
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,280
 Three wise men lived far in the east.

298
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,280
 They followed the star to get to the feast.

299
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,280
 Let's visit the newborn king.

300
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:05,280
 We need to get him gifts.

301
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
 Let's follow the star.

302
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:28,280
 It will take us to the baby.

303
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:38,280
 They all gathered around.

304
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
 The new baby boy.

305
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,280
 Everyone welcome to share in the joy.

306
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,280
 From angels to donkeys, from shepherds to kings,

307
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,280
 share in joy.

308
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
 Everyone shares the joy that he brings.

309
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,280
 No one snapped out no matter how small.

310
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,280
 Happy Christmas to one and to all.

311
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280

420
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,280
 We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

421
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,280
 We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

422
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,280
 We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

423
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,280
 We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

424
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,280
 We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

425
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,280
 We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

426
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,280
 We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

427
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,280
 We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

428
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,280
 We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

429
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:16,280
 We all sin against God, so our relationship with God is broken down.

430
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,280
 We say hurtful things to each other,

431
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,280
 so there's a lot of breakdown in relationships with other people.

432
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,280
 And even our relationship with creation is broken down,

433
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,280
 because we were called to be stewards of creation,

434
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,280
 but yet we treat God's beautiful creation as just something we can do whatever we want to with.

435
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:44,280
 And so what I want to do is I want to actually set things in the larger story of the Bible.

436
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,280
 So first, this is a story in four acts.

437
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,280
 It's a mini overview.

438
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:57,280
 The first one is God says he created the world, creation,

439
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,280
 and that it was good what he created.

440
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,280
 And he also said that when he created humans, that it was very good.

441
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:11,280
 It was the pinnacle of God's creation, because they're made in God's image.

442
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,280
 But then we're told that sin enters the world.

443
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,280
 It's known as the fall, where people rebel against God,

444
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,280
 and they struggle to trust God, that God really means it well with them.

445
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,280
 And so they did what God asked them not to do,

446
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,280
 and that's what we know as the fall, the sin fall.

447
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:40,280
 Now, as already shared, this sin has impacted everything, every fabric of society.

448
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
 And it's not just that we ourselves sin,

449
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:49,280
 it's also that there are sinful structures that cause people to be oppressed and suffer and injustices.

450
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:56,280
 And so when we talk about Jesus bringing good news and being the Savior,

451
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,280
 he has come to rescue us from our brokenness, from our sin.

452
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,280
 And God's Word also says that we ourselves cannot do it.

453
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
 We can't do it out of our own strength.

454
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
 There's nothing within us.

455
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,280
 We can't try harder to be a better person.

456
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,280
 It's not about putting in that little bit more effort.

457
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,280
 God's Word says you cannot do it.

458
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,280
 You cannot fix your sin issue yourself.

459
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,280
 Now, some of us might wonder, am I even a sinner?

460
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
 What is that?

461
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,280
 So I want to say a little bit more about that.

462
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,280
 Sin means missing the mark of what God desires of people.

463
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,280
 And that means it can be even things we do in our heart.

464
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,280
 It's not just that we murdered someone or something like that,

465
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,280
 though that also, of course, is a sin.

466
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,280
 But it can be like having judgmental thoughts, envying other people,

467
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,280
 acting selfishly when we know what is good.

468
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:54,280
 And so Jesus has come to rescue us from our sin, to forgive us our sins,

469
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,280
 and to invite us into his family.

470
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:04,280
 And that's why we celebrate Christmas and we're like, "Wow, this is amazing."

471
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:12,280
 The King of Kings humbled himself, became a little child to start his rescue mission

472
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,280
 so that we can move from being estranged from God to become family of God

473
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,280
 and be in that relationship and experience this peace, this joy, this life

474
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,280
 that Jesus only gives.

475
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,280
 Jesus really puts us on a different trajectory.

476
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,280
 Before we know Jesus, we're enslaved to sin.

477
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
 That's what God's Word says.

478
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,280
 But when Jesus comes, he rescues us from sin.

479
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
 He breaks us free.

480
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,280
 And then we can learn to live a different way

481
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,280
 because of Jesus being at work in our lives.

482
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
 And we can rely on him.

483
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,280
 He gives us the grace and the strength to become more loving people,

484
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,280
 become the people he created us in the first place to be.

485
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,280
 And so this is the incredible news of Christmas.

486
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,280
 So there is room in God's family for all people.

487
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
 It's for everyone.

488
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
 Nobody is too far away.

489
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,280
 Nobody is too broken or too messed up that they are outside the scope

490
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,280
 of Jesus' rescue and love.

491
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
 Nobody.

492
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,280
 So that means that Christmas is also good news for every single person

493
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,280
 because we can receive this gift of salvation, this gift of new life

494
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,280
 that Jesus gives when we place our trust in him and believe in him

495
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,280
 and turn away from our way of living apart from him.

496
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,280
 Now, I was watching Instagram.

497
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
 Anyone?

498
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
 Scrolling.

499
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,280
 Sometimes you get stuck in that endless scrolling to another thing.

500
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,280
 And there was an image that I want to leave us with.

501
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,280
 There was a family that asked this little boy to unpack a gift.

502
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
 And so he unpacks it.

503
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,280
 He opens up the package, and he gets out a picture frame.

504
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,280
 And on the picture frame was a family picture, but he was not in it.

505
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:16,280
 And then there was a note that said, "Next year, we want you to be part

506
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,280
 of this family picture."

507
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,280
 And so the kid was trying to figure out what this meant, and it was like,

508
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
 his name was Connor.

509
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
 "Connor, we want to adopt you.

510
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,280
 We want you to be part of our family."

511
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:38,280
 Now, on Christmas, what Jesus is saying is, "I want you to be part of my family.

512
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
 I want to adopt you.

513
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,280
 I want to welcome you in because he loves us, and there's room for every

514
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,280
 person in God's family."

515
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,280
 And so that same gift is extended to us, and it's just up to us, you know,

516
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
 whether or not we receive it.

517
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,280
 So this, indeed, is the great news of Christmas, that Jesus has come,

518
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,280
 that he has addressed our sin issue, that he forgives us, gives us new life,

519
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,280
 and that he invites us to be part of his family because he wants you to be

520
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,280
 part of his family picture as well.

521
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,280
 And so as we celebrate Christmas today, as you celebrate with friends and

522
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,280
 family, I want to encourage you to take some time to just express thanks,

523
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,280
 if you know Jesus, to what Jesus has done, or to talk about Jesus if you

524
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,280
 don't know Jesus yet and what Jesus means.

525
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,280
 And to, yeah, thank God for the greatest gift of all.

526
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,280
 And so what I'd love to do is pray for you, but I also want to invite the

527
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,280
 worship team to come back up as well.

528
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,280
 So let me pray for us.

529
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:57,280
 Jesus, we thank you so much that you didn't leave us stuck in our sin,

530
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,280
 but you chose to come in a way that we can receive you as a child, as a

531
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,280
 little baby, vulnerable, though you are the King of kings.

532
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,280
 And you came to ultimately to lay down your life on the cross for us and to

533
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,280
 rise from the dead so that we can be forgiven and become new creations in you.

534
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,280
 And so we thank you, Jesus.

535
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,280
 We worship you, and we are just humbled and moved and touched by you,

536
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
 that you love us so much.

537
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,280
 And we thank you that you make us part of your family, that you give us a new

538
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,280
 family to belong to, and that we can know your love, your acceptance, and

539
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,280
 also the new life that we have in you with peace and joy and hope that we do

540
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
 not know without you in the same way.

541
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,280
 So we give you all the glory, and I pray this in your name, Jesus.

542
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
 Amen.

00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,280
 So what better way would it be to wrap this Christmas up, this Christmas

545
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,280
 service with another carol?

546
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,280
 And I think as we were singing "O Come All Ye Faithful" earlier, I was just

547
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,280
 really moved when we were singing "O Come Let Us Adore Him," and we'll

548
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
 praise his name forever.

549
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
