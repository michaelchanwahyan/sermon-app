[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   Amen. - Amen. Thank you, Alison.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.560]   Good morning, everyone. - Good morning.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.360]   Morning, morning. So, like Alison said, if you have been involving in CGs,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.440]   you might have known me, but let me introduce myself a little bit.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.400]   So I joined the pastoral team almost for four years now.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.360]   So four years ago, I was the former CG pastor
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.640]   who's pastor team leading Yuen Long Church right now.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.120]   Oh, by the way, hi, Tim. I know you've been watching.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.320]   And so he invited me to join the CG team to work on the pastoral team.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.760]   So it was a long journey for me as well, but long story short, I'm here.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.200]   So it's a privilege for me to share the word with you all this morning.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.480]   So I was chatting with my brother last week,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.360]   and I told him that, "Oh, I'm going to preach on forgiveness today."
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.680]   And then he laughed immediately.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.760]   He was like, "You? Teaching on forgiveness? Seriously?"
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.480]   And yeah, why did he laugh?
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.360]   Something that he has been teasing me a lot is,
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.080]   like, I think my colleagues will be able to testify as well,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.320]   that I have slightly better memory than average.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.280]   So I remember things.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.160]   So it's helpful for me at work because I remember things,
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.000]   gets me more efficient, and also for me to be in a bigger church community,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.520]   it helps me to remember people as well.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.360]   But it's really unhelpful when we talk about forgiveness.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.080]   So my brother has been describing that I have a register to remember,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.720]   like, to write down who has offended me, how they have offended me,
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.720]   and it's probably thicker than my Bible.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.960]   Well, FYI, this thing does not exist, I don't have a register,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.240]   but these things do stay in my head sometimes.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.200]   But we have been hearing that forgiveness is not about just forgetting, right?
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.920]   And no matter how forgetful you are, there are things that you remember.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.040]   There are things that it is hard for you to let go as well.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.160]   There are times for you to struggle with forgiveness.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.480]   So what I'm trying to say is, if you find it difficult to let things go,
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.400]   you are not alone. I'm like that as well.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.800]   These past three weeks, we have been hearing and reflecting
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.360]   on the importance of forgiveness, how we have been forgiven by God,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.720]   and what forgiveness is.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.240]   And today, we will look into forgiving others.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.920]   Before we open the Bible today, I have a question for us.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.720]   I wonder, what does it look like when we struggle with forgiveness?
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.320]   Those people you need to see regularly, perhaps not someone stepping on your feet
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:10.120]   on MTR, but maybe our colleagues, our family members, our friends,
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.320]   or even our brothers and sisters in the church.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.920]   If they have offended you, how would that impact you?
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.960]   When you struggle with forgiving them, how would you react?
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.520]   And what comes to your mind when you see them?
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.280]   Do you just hide your thoughts, hide your emotions,
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.640]   and try to act normal in front of people?
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.040]   Do you try to avoid these people?
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.640]   Or would you want to exclude them from your circle?
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.240]   For me, if someone offends me, I would definitely go to the avoidance side.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.040]   If you offend me, I don't want to see you.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.680]   If I see you in a pantry, I will not get water until you walk out the pantry.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.440]   If I see you in the lower house, I would probably go to the upper house.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.160]   But actually, I don't get to decide.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.120]   And if I see you in my family dinner, I would try to get the furthest seat I can
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.160]   just to avoid talking to you.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.720]   I wonder if you can resonate with any of these.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.320]   But this is not what God intend us to be, right?
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.840]   Especially when it happens in our church community.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:40.080]   We are brothers and sisters, and we are all part of the same body of Christ.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.520]   So today, we will look into the forgiveness within the church body in our early church.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.880]   Last week, Derek shared one of the biblical examples of forgiveness with us,
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.480]   with Stephen getting stoned, and he released his forgiveness to the people who killed him.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.640]   Such a beautiful testimony from one of the followers of Christ.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.680]   And I would like to continue to read that passage, the immediate verses after that.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.680]   So Acts 7.59, "While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.920]   'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.'
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:31.440]   Then he fell on his knees and cried out, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against him.'
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.680]   When he had said this, he fell asleep."
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.520]   And immediately after this, "And Saul approved of their killing him.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.880]   On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.760]   and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.280]   Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.360]   But Saul began to destroy the church, going from house to house.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.560]   He dragged off both men and women and put them in prison."
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.200]   So the scripture tells us that it was Saul who approved the killing,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.640]   and we know that this Saul is the apostle Paul,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.720]   who later became an apostle and has done a lot for our church.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.400]   "And he killed Stephen."
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.960]   Stephen is now with Jesus, he does not need to struggle with forgiveness anymore,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.600]   and in fact, he doesn't need to struggle with anything anymore.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:45.280]   But how about his brothers and sisters, those who witnessed the killing?
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.280]   If we read chapter 6, we can see that Stephen was one of the seven people
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.920]   whom the twelve apostles appointed to help with the ministry.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.320]   And the scripture describes Stephen as a man full of God's grace and power,
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.000]   performed great wonders and signs among the people.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.680]   Such a faithful brother that they have lost.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.400]   Those who witnessed would struggle with their emotions,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.520]   they mourned deeply for him.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.920]   And there were even more and more people getting imprisoned and killed
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.240]   by the Jews and Saul.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.160]   How would the church community feel towards the Jews and Saul in this case?
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.920]   Sometimes when we read this passage, we go too fast into,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.720]   "Oh, he's the apostle Paul, has done so much for Jesus later,
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.680]   wrote so many letters that we are still reading today."
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:57.280]   And it's true that he's a great apostle that built up the foundation of our faith.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.880]   But perhaps sometimes we miss the perspective from other disciples at that time.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.400]   In their eyes, in the church's eyes at that time,
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.800]   he is a murderer who killed a lot of Christians.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.480]   And he is an oppressor as well.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:24.000]   If I were one of them, if I personally witnessed that my friends are getting killed by a person,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.600]   this is something that I will always remember.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:35.280]   And I would definitely struggle with forgiving them.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.720]   So,
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:46.480]   but we remember that in the past weeks that we can't rely on our own strength to forgive people.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.240]   This is the good news for us. We don't need to do that by ourselves.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   And God's work in people are amazing.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:05.200]   As we continue to read, we can see how God moves the people in the early church to forgive in this case.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:13.120]   "Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision,
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.760]   'Ananias,' and he said, 'He I am, Lord.'
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.280]   And the Lord said to him, 'Get up and go to the street called Strait,
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:32.080]   and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:39.920]   And he has seen a vision, a man named Ananias came in and lay his hands on him,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.280]   so that he might regain his sight.'
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.920]   But Ananias replied, 'Lord, I have heard from many people about this man,
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.000]   how much harm he did to your saints in Jerusalem.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.840]   And here he has authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.'
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:08.000]   But the Lord said to him, 'Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.520]   to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel,
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.600]   for I will show him how much he must suffer in behalf of my name.'
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:28.000]   So Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him, he said,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.280]   'Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming,
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:43.040]   has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.'
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:50.560]   And immediately something like fish scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:57.920]   and he got up and was baptized, and he took food and was strengthened.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:06.560]   So we can see that when Ananias hears about the idea of going to find Saul and laying hands on him,
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.200]   he was unsure about that.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:16.160]   Saul was literally still on his way to persecute the church before his conversion.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.560]   The danger is real before we even talk about forgiveness in this case.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.680]   And we can see that Ananias was subtly against this idea.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:35.360]   See how he called Saul 'this man', not even addressing his name.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:46.080]   But God explains his plan to Ananias, that Ananias has a role in God's work as well.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.800]   His role is to redeem Saul's life, so in the future,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.400]   Saul can proclaim Jesus' name to Gentiles and other people.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.200]   So we are under the Gentiles category, right? Most of us.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:10.720]   Can we imagine what happens to us if Ananias disobeyed God at the moment?
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.600]   Would we even exist?
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   I'm sure God has his own way to work that out if Ananias refused to do that.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:29.120]   But thankfully, Ananias chose to obey, and he is willing to be part of God's work.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:35.200]   I want us to pay attention to how Ananias addresses Paul when he gets there.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:42.480]   The first word he said is, "Brother Saul, this is powerful.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.920]   From this man to brother."
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.080]   Ananias knows his assignment.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:13:01.040]   The way that he calls him 'brother' demonstrated forgiveness and also full acceptance to Saul,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:08.240]   that he has included Saul into the church community, which is essential.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.440]   Because Jesus could have healed his eyes, healed Saul's eyes in his own way.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.760]   He doesn't need to send people there.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:22.800]   But Jesus chose to send someone to do that, to be part of his work.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.280]   Have we thought about why?
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.800]   God intended his people to be accepted in his community.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.960]   No matter what terrible things we have done in our life,
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:44.800]   and no matter how unworthy we feel we are, we are all accepted.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:54.320]   Jesus sends Ananias to Saul to accept him before he even proves that he is a worthy Christian.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.640]   This is powerful.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.000]   Because how can Saul convince the acceptance of the forgiveness of God
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.080]   if he didn't experience that from other Christians?
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:15.120]   However, being accepted by Ananias does not mean that the whole community has accepted him.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.640]   Yet.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.440]   I want to continue to read the story as I want us to know that
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.080]   it was uneasy for the early church community as well.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.040]   It takes time for the community to go through the forgiveness journey.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:37.760]   And different people would have their own pace, would have their own journey on that.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.040]   Just like you and me.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:49.200]   When he, he is Saul, came to Jerusalem, he tried repeatedly to associate with the disciples.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:57.200]   And yet, they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was a disciple.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:03.760]   But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:09.200]   how he had seen the Lord on the row, and that he had talked to him,
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:15.760]   and how he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus at Damascus.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:25.600]   And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.560]   And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews,
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.800]   but they were attempting to put him to death.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:43.760]   Now when the brothers learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:51.520]   So the scripture tells us, emphasizing that he repeatedly tried to associate with the disciples,
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.240]   but they were afraid of him.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:03.040]   We can see that Saul's repentance and conversion did not immediately lead to forgiveness
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.320]   and acceptance from the whole community.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.800]   People still remember what he has done,
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.400]   and probably still wrestling with the loss that they have experienced.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.240]   How would they trust this murderer immediately?
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:27.360]   It indeed takes time and people's effort to encourage forgiveness in the community.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   But here we've got a Barnabas who didn't only offer his own forgiveness to Saul,
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:42.400]   but also to help Saul to be forgiven by other people.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:49.440]   Barnabas put in effort in helping the community to see what has happened in Saul
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:57.520]   and more importantly to see Saul's new identity as a Christian, as a follower of Christ,
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.800]   and to help Saul to be accepted by the community.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.680]   And forgiveness does not mean that what Saul has done is forgotten.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:15.680]   In fact, what he has done is remembered forever, as it is recorded in the Bible.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:21.200]   But forgiveness is letting go of our sense of being wronged and offended,
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:29.840]   and to see the person in God's sight, to see them from God's perspective.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:38.160]   And this act, this act of forgiveness, is to fulfill God's work in our community.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.720]   And at the same time, I want us to see that Saul also takes his ownership of his actions.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.480]   Firstly, he didn't force others to forgive him.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:56.160]   He didn't say to other Christians, "Oh, you are a Christian. You're supposed to be gracious.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:01.840]   You're supposed to be merciful. You're supposed to be forgiving."
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.040]   These words sound familiar, right? But Saul didn't do it.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.880]   Also, if we read the letters he was writing to the church,
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.800]   he has not been hiding the things that he has done.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:21.520]   He takes responsibility of his own sins and actions.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:30.000]   And it is important that we know that it is by the grace of God that he has been forgiven.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.040]   Forgiven by God, and forgiven by others.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.120]   Church, this is a reminder to us as well.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:45.520]   If we have wronged others, take responsibility of our own actions.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.720]   Ask for forgiveness with the posture of asking grace.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:57.360]   For us who need to forgive others, we are not only doing that for the sake of our mental health.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:03.600]   There's something more. We are doing the work of God.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:10.160]   Ananias, with his obedience, becomes part of God's plan to redeem Saul's life
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:17.520]   so that he can become the apostle Paul that God intends him to be.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.840]   And Barnabas and the whole community works together on their forgiveness with Saul.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:31.120]   Together, they have demonstrated the forgiveness of Jesus to Saul.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:37.760]   This is the church. This is who we are.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.800]   Starting with a strong foundation of forgiveness.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.120]   Perhaps today in this room, we don't have an apostle Saul for us to redeem,
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:58.320]   but will we lay down our preferences and rights to fulfill God's work within our community?
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.840]   I want to share a little bit of my personal story as well,
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:08.720]   which I took a long time to forgive the people in my church community as well.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.040]   It happened in my uni time. I was not in this church yet.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:20.320]   I was part of a young adults community, just like 180 here, similar.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.440]   So one time we were planning for an event together,
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.640]   and then the communication was bad. It was terrible.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.600]   And the event did not turn out as we wished.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:37.200]   So it ended up like the organizers were having a conflict among us.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.920]   So for sure, I was part of that conflict.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:46.800]   And then people in our community heard of this conflict among the organizers,
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.760]   and people started to take sides,
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:55.040]   which we know is unhelpful when we are involved in a conflict.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.960]   But we were young, right?
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.160]   It wasn't that of a big deal at the beginning,
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:07.280]   but things got worse, and then we get to a point that we can't really resolve it.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:14.960]   So just as I said in the beginning, if I get offended, I will avoid the people.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.560]   So that's what I did. I stopped showing up to my community gatherings.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.880]   And then later, I felt, "Oh, I still want a community."
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:33.360]   I made an even worse decision that I joined another community in the same church.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.920]   My church wasn't that big, just a few hundred people, so we all know each other.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.440]   It was very weird that we show up in the same church,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.800]   but I just went to another community.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.400]   But I am quite stubborn, if I'm honest.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.000]   So I did that for almost half a year,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.560]   until someone from my original community came to me and told me that,
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:05.440]   "Jennifer, you know what? We missed you, and we want you to come back."
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.400]   At the bottom of my heart, I wanted to do that as well,
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:14.960]   but at that time, I was not brave enough to do the conversation that I need to do,
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.640]   to forgive what has happened, to forgive the people,
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.600]   and at the same time, ask for their forgiveness.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.480]   So I was being immature for a few more months,
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.840]   and then finally, I got myself together and felt, "I really want to go back."
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:38.480]   So in that period, more people came and asked me to go back,
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.760]   to encourage me, "You can do it."
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.000]   They are like Barnabas and Ananias in my situation,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.520]   to help me to go back and have conversation with the people.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.240]   So at the end, I did that, I went back,
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.440]   and then I have the conversation with my community,
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.400]   and we all lay down what has happened,
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.480]   and continue to have fellowship together.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.760]   From this experience, I personally experience the power
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:16.560]   of both forgiveness and also unforgiveness in a church community,
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:23.200]   and how a few people's actions can impact the whole community.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.400]   Well, the honest truth is, as long as we are in community,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.640]   as long as we are with people, conflicts will happen,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.280]   and we will need to forgive.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:41.840]   For Saul as well, after him being accepted, became an apostle,
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.040]   he still has conflict.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.080]   He had a conflict with Mark later, and then it leads to splitting,
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.880]   and even more conflicts within the early church community.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.560]   But later, they sort that out, the relationship,
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:05.200]   and then both Mark and Paul are having important roles in the early church.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:11.680]   So what I'm saying is, as long as we are in the community,
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.520]   we can't really avoid conflict,
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.920]   we can't really avoid the conversation of forgiveness.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.400]   Earlier this year, we have gone through the Ephesians series,
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.920]   which is written by Paul.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.560]   There's a passage that Paul writes his reflection about forgiveness.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.320]   Let me read it to you.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.640]   "Get rid of all bitterness, rage, and anger.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.920]   Brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.200]   Be kind and compassionate to one another,
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:49.760]   forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.520]   We see, this is Paul's reflection after all the things that had happened in his life.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.640]   It is essential for the church community to forgive one another,
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.120]   as the sense of unforgiveness will birth into something else
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.960]   that will harm the whole community.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.560]   And forgiveness is hard.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.600]   It's not as simple as just saying, "I forgive you," to each other.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.600]   But it is a hard work.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.600]   We need to do that from the bottom of our heart.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.760]   And there are things that it's really difficult to handle.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.360]   Things like people that broke your trust,
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.600]   people who betrayed you,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.560]   or even people who abused you.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.960]   And again, if you are in an abusive situation,
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.400]   do seek help from the people you trust.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.120]   But what I'm saying is,
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.600]   "I forgive you" does not have the magical power
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.720]   to heal all the wounds that are in your heart.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.760]   It takes time, and it takes effort,
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.000]   and it takes God's grace for us to do the forgiveness.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.480]   I'm not sure what you are going through right now,
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.560]   but you are not alone.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:18.400]   You don't need to do this alone if you are struggling with forgiveness.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.080]   If you are struggling with forgiving people,
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.200]   again, this is hard.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.760]   It takes time and effort to do that.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.240]   But do ask for God's grace and strength to do that.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:36.400]   He is with you, and only by His power we can do that.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.280]   And if you have offended someone,
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.520]   if you need to ask for forgiveness,
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.160]   take responsibility of your own action.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.360]   Go find the people that you have offended
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.000]   and ask for their forgiveness.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.880]   Make known of your heart to the people
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.280]   and ask genuinely.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:04.080]   And ask again for God's grace and strength to do that.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.360]   And for some of us,
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:11.680]   we might be the people that are seeing the struggle of forgiveness around us.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.240]   If you are walking with people on that,
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.200]   let's come around the people who struggle
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.960]   because they need the community to help them.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.400]   Be like Barnabas or Ananias,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.680]   that help people, to encourage people to forgive.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.240]   To come around them, to support them,
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.400]   because it is a long journey.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.840]   Do not take sides.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.640]   I'm saying this from my very painful experience.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.880]   Try to see the things in God's perspective.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.080]   And try to see that we are doing the work of God.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:59.920]   And we are doing this together as one body.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.120]   And this is like we are called the body of Christ
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.840]   to demonstrate who Jesus is to the people around us.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.320]   So let's demonstrate the love of Christ
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.200]   and the power of forgiveness as this is to fulfill God's work.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:20.160]   So right now, we will hear some testimonies from our own community.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.040]   May I invite Pasajan to facilitate that
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.480]   and invite our guests for today, Charles and Alison.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.000]   Thank you, Pasajan.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   And let's welcome, this is Alison.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.200]   Alison and Charles, let's give them a warm welcome.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.720]   Yes, so Alison and Charles, you've both led community groups here.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.400]   Alison, you're currently serving on Alpha
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.120]   and Charles, you've been involved, you've been leading a CG
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.440]   and you've been involved in Cleansing Stream as well.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:55.440]   And today, we've heard a story from Jen's life within church community
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.400]   and we'll hear different communities from you both.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.880]   And Alison, why don't we start with you?
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.040]   Could you share about just a recent testimony of conflict?
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.480]   Sure. My story comes from the workplace.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.800]   So ever since I was a teenager,
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.920]   I've dreamed of becoming a really kick-butt CEO.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.800]   I don't know if I'm allowed to say the word "butt" but I will just say it.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.280]   And I've had a passion for the corporate world and the business world.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.600]   And for much of the last decade and a half I've been working since university,
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.960]   I felt I was very successful and confident in my career.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.000]   You know, in these companies that I worked for,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.800]   every year they would give annual performance reviews
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.200]   and I tended to place pretty high.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   So it just affirmed the confidence I had in myself that, you know,
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.880]   I'm a good leader, I'm a good worker,
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.160]   I'm recognized for my, you know, characteristics at work
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.320]   and identified as a high achiever.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.520]   So when this incident came two years ago in the workplace,
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.200]   it was extremely hard for me.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.640]   I had the toughest challenge yet in my career
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.040]   and I had a horrible relationship with my boss.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.360]   And my relationship with him wasn't always strange,
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.320]   but suddenly a year into working with him,
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.240]   things took a really bad turn.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.000]   We would often have very big team meetings.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.560]   Who has big team meetings, you know, when you have work?
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.360]   He, every time when I spoke up,
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.640]   I felt that he would vocally just humiliate me
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.160]   and turn the things down I said
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.840]   and make it known that, you know,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.880]   what I was saying or suggesting was not the right way.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.760]   And he would get very vocally nasty in front of the whole team
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.640]   and say that to me.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   And in other smaller team discussions, it was the same.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.160]   And, you know, he was very condescending in his speech.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.880]   So I felt humiliated, I felt hurt, and I was surprised.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.680]   And I tried to address this in our one-on-one discussions
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.800]   and ask him, you know,
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.280]   "How do you see me doing better, Mr. Boss?"
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.760]   Because obviously there's some issues.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.520]   And it was a very hard discussion.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.320]   He eventually never really gave any clear answers,
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.280]   but made it known that he would be hiring someone else
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.040]   to take over from my role.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.640]   So that was very difficult for me.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.840]   - Not easy, thank you.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.560]   And Charles, could you share with us your family background?
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.240]   - Sure, good morning, everyone.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:19.680]   I'm sharing a story from my family background.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.440]   So I grew up in a family with a lot of relationship challenges.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.000]   So there's a lot of emotional abuse
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.520]   happening within the family.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.400]   And eventually my parents are divorced.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.720]   And my brother and I, after we got into university,
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.800]   we moved out of the family just to be on our own
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.240]   so that we can have some peace.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.400]   So at first I thought I just, I'm in a clear,
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:50.880]   but because the family didn't really have a common practice
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.720]   of forgiveness and apology.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.760]   So I actually needed to learn it much later on
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.840]   in my adult life.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.120]   So I will share one example with you, one story with you.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.120]   So this was when I was in my late 30s already.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.400]   And at that time, my father was in his 80s
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.680]   and we were all living separately on our own.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.600]   And one year he had a stroke.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.120]   And then of course the family rallied together
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.120]   to try to care for my dad.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.400]   And during this time, we found out that he actually
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.120]   has been involved in a mess for a while
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.160]   and nobody in our family knew about it.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.200]   So in order to help him out, I decided that
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.400]   at that time I was still single.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.720]   So I moved back to be with him.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.440]   I packed up half of my belongings.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.000]   I moved back.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.600]   I still kept my place, trying to support my dad
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.800]   and try to hopefully, hoping that he will not,
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.920]   he will have a new life and not be involved
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.920]   in messy situations again.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.720]   So long story short, after about six months,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.360]   I realized that, my brother and I realized that
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.960]   my dad is still involved in the mess.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.080]   And I was very upset because I put in a lot of effort.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.560]   My life was really difficult, going to work,
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.120]   having two places, having pets to look after,
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   like just really chaos.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.080]   So I was really obsessed.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.840]   I packed my stuff and I went back home
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.040]   and I just disassociated.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.520]   So it felt like, okay, I'm back in my own place.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.760]   I should be feeling better now.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.920]   And I learned a very valuable lesson during this season
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.120]   because when I moved back home for the next six months,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.360]   I was tortured by memories.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.600]   And these are memories of my past wrongdoings,
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.280]   things that I've done that I hurt people in the past.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.680]   And these are old stuff as well
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.360]   that I thought I have resolved with God.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.760]   I've confessed and I thought I received forgiveness.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.800]   But these memories, for some reason,
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.480]   in that season came back and they would replay in my mind
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.760]   like movie trailers.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:05.040]   Imagine you have a movie trailer of your bad deeds playing.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.800]   That's really a torture actually.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.160]   So after about six months, I really couldn't stand it.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.000]   So I was thinking to myself,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.720]   what had actually really changed that this is happening?
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.760]   And it still took me about two weeks to realize
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.720]   that it might be because I have held a grudge against my dad.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.840]   And at that point, I realized that I really need to forgive my dad.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.840]   And also at that point,
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.720]   because it was just a decision to forgive my dad,
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.200]   I also realized I was holding a grudge
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.720]   based on my own choice as well.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.240]   And the forgiveness was also a choice that I could make.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.480]   So I made the choice to forgive my dad.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.120]   When I made up with him, I totally behaved like normal again.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.440]   And actually, very, very, almost instantaneously,
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.520]   all the tormenting videos would stop playing in my mind again.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.720]   So it was a very dramatic lesson for me.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.320]   And Charles, how did that impact you when you were growing up?
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.040]   How did you cope with people?
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:12.400]   Because when I was growing up, there was a lot of emotional abuse.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.040]   So I would withdraw.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:21.360]   I would try to stay away from the pain, the source of the pain.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.480]   And I will grow up to become a very self-reliant person
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.200]   because I want to minimize my reliance on people
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.320]   so that I will have less pain, right?
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.440]   Basically, that's how I coped with it when I was growing up.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.560]   When I grew up, when I was in my late 20s,
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.400]   so I learned a very valuable lesson in church life,
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.200]   which is to share it with others.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.880]   Like I started to have safe mentors that I can meet with regularly,
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.160]   and I share my pain with them, and it really helped me out.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.160]   I even saw a therapist for about, I think, two years.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.440]   So it really helped me out.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:00.480]   And one other thing, though, is when I was repeating these stories
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.520]   over a period of time, I realized I was repeating it over and over,
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.800]   and I was still lacking a little bit of stuff to move forward.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.160]   And afterwards, I eventually realized that,
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.280]   apart from sharing with people, I need to...
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.000]   Forgiveness is the key that was missing in my life.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.160]   So I needed to work forgiveness out into my life as well.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.920]   Yeah, and Allison, I know you worked with a therapist as well,
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.240]   but before we go there, how did you cope with that pain in this workplace?
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.440]   What did you do?
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.080]   Yeah, I think before I got on my knees with the decision to forgive,
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.120]   because that was very hard,
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.320]   I felt like actually my voice was stolen in the workplace.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.520]   That was very difficult for me.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.840]   I'm usually a very vocal and direct person,
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.080]   but whenever there was a team meeting, I would just...
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.000]   I dreaded every day going to work,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.240]   and I just felt like I wanted to be invisible.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.520]   I didn't want to be seen.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.480]   And the worst was just seeing team members I hired and trained personally.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.840]   They saw that the political tide was obviously not in my favor,
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.160]   so they would turn against me to ensure that
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.920]   they would still have a job at the end of the day.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.760]   So it was very hurtful.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.560]   And eventually, I felt like I had no option,
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.320]   because I knew I would be replaced,
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.760]   was to leave, to leave the company and to leave his leadership.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:21.360]   But even that was hard, because I would keep seeing him around Hong Kong.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.840]   Turns out we went to the same grad school, me and this boss,
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.520]   and he would come up to me and be like,
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.000]   "Why do I keep still seeing you, even after you left?"
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.480]   And I was like, "Well, I live in Hong Kong too,
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.680]   and we went to the same school."
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.600]   So anyways, but it was hard, but with time,
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.840]   and we can share about the forgiveness journey too,
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.440]   as I worked with a therapist,
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.600]   with the awesome community around me here,
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.200]   and of course, with God's help, all of that changed eventually.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.800]   Yeah, so how did the therapist and the community around you,
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.200]   what did that look like for you?
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.440]   I sought the help of a career counselor who's also a Christian,
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.880]   and he knew me very well.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.000]   And he said, "You know, Alison, this is not who you are in the workplace."
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.960]   And he spoke some very affirming, life-giving words,
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.560]   and he encouraged me to write down a list of,
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.800]   you know, because I said my voice was like stolen,
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.560]   you know, of what I'm thankful for,
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.000]   and what my identity is in Christ in the workplace.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.680]   And I wrote all this down, and he said,
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:19.920]   "You know, read this aloud to your husband,
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.160]   and make sure he affirms you as well.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:22.960]   He's here."
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   And so that helped a lot,
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.080]   and it just helped remind me of my identity in Christ.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.360]   My community here at The Vine have been really supportive.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.480]   They kept listening to me when I was really down,
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.080]   and, you know, they really encouraged me,
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.560]   and told me, you know, "There is a future.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.160]   This is not the only thing,
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.760]   that your work situation is not one that is going to stay.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.320]   And as you move on, it will get better.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.440]   This is not the end."
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.680]   And they prayed with me, and believed with me,
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.480]   and eventually helped me to get to that place of,
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.880]   "I want to get rid of this chain holding me back.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.240]   This is not worth it."
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.720]   Because I know I could do well in the workplace.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.320]   It was this experience that I didn't want to be stuck in it anymore.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.320]   So I think those things all helped.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.120]   - Yeah.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.760]   And so we hear from both of you how people around you,
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.360]   how the community around you,
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.440]   be it a therapist, a mentor,
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.840]   or the Christian community have really helped you
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.640]   to really go through that forgiveness,
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.640]   which we've heard it takes time.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:23.920]   And we know we've heard that you've both chosen to forgive,
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.440]   and we just want to hear from you.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.560]   What does walking out this forgiveness in your life look like?
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.720]   Alison, why don't you start?
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.600]   - Okay.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.440]   I would say it's definitely not an overnight forgiveness journey.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.160]   Even now today, when I think of this person,
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.880]   I wouldn't say I've 100% forgiven him.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.920]   But it gets a little bit better every day.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.840]   And just like Pastor Derek shared last week in his sermon,
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.040]   it was a decision.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.160]   It started with a decision.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.240]   "Hey, God, I'm really stuck in this.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.840]   I really need your help to forgive."
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.200]   Recognizing, vocalizing the pain it caused,
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.800]   and a conscious decision not to continuously dwell
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.040]   in that hate and resentment circle.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.600]   And I would say that first step already helped immensely
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.760]   to let go of the pain and to forgive.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.760]   And if I were to see this leader that I had
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.680]   that caused me so much pain right now,
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.400]   to come up to me right now,
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.040]   I at least wouldn't punch him in the guts.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.880]   Like I would be okay,
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   and I would wish God's blessing upon him.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.040]   And eventually moving on to a new workplace
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.680]   where I felt like I was healed and restored
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.600]   in my identity also helped.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.160]   So sometimes leaving that was also helpful,
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.800]   but it was really the Holy Spirit and God
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.240]   working in their heart to let go.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.680]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.240]   And Charles?
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.200]   - I agree with Alison.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.840]   I needed to make the choice.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:56.480]   For me, because of what the Holy Spirit shared with me
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.480]   regarding my past sin against others,
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.680]   I find it non-negotiable these days
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.800]   with regard to forgiving others
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.160]   because I realized I actually needed it more.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.520]   I needed God's forgiveness over my own sins
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.560]   more than the other person needing the forgiveness for me.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.880]   So it's a very personal thing.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.800]   I can feel the weight of sin coming back upon me
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.280]   when I was unforgiving towards my dad.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.840]   And during even moments these days
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.040]   when I was edging back towards unforgiveness
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.640]   towards anyone,
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.080]   I started to feel the weight again upon my heart.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.800]   So because of that, I also remember,
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.160]   there's a parable of the unforgiving servants
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.840]   that Jesus talked about,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.600]   that this king had servants
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.160]   and there's this servant owed him like a million dollars,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.560]   impossible debt, like 10 billion.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.080]   I think it was a huge amount.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.840]   And the king had mercy
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.600]   and just know that he couldn't pay,
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.280]   so he forgave him.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.440]   And then the servant turned around
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.000]   and tried to chase down $1,000 or $10,000
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.880]   from a fellow colleague.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.680]   And it was outrageous.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.480]   So the person was put back into prison to be tormented.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.920]   So when I had that experience,
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.080]   I felt like, oh, I was the unmerciful servant.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.200]   So through all these revelation of the spirit,
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.640]   I now walk very cautiously.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.880]   Also, I know that after even 20 years
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.840]   of being a Christian,
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.240]   these days as I'm still working out
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.120]   how to overcome,
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.160]   working on the process of overcoming sin
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.520]   through the Holy Spirit,
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.040]   I still inadvertently would hurt people here and there.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.480]   So even for myself, if I'm hurting people,
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.040]   how can I not forgive others as well?
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.800]   So that's why I am really cautiously
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.920]   living out forgiveness in my life on a regular basis.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.680]   Thank you both.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.320]   We've really heard real life stories
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.680]   of how they've struggled,
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.240]   how they've navigated the conflict
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.440]   and the forgiveness journey,
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.160]   and really honor you and appreciate you both
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.280]   for sharing today.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.560]   We hope that's blessed you.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.200]   And let's give them a round of applause again.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.800]   Thank you.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.360]   Thank you.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.760]   And now we're going to take some time
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.160]   to respond to God.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.720]   So can I invite you all to stand
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.320]   and let me pray.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:38.800]   God, we thank you for that reminder of that parable,
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:43.520]   how we have been so completely forgiven.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.320]   And we know, God, it's not easy.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.960]   But right now we just take some time
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   and we pray that through your spirit,
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.520]   you will do that next bit of your work,
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.360]   that next bit of healing, of restoration,
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.120]   of helping us either to choose to release forgiveness
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.400]   or to continually choose again and again
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.280]   and again and again,
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.720]   to lay down our resentment.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:23.760]   Pray for anyone here who needs that chain of resentment
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.720]   to be loosened.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:30.640]   I pray for anyone perhaps who knows
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.200]   that they are the one who needs to ask for forgiveness.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.200]   Holy Spirit, we just come before you now.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.160]   It's your work.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.120]   It's your grace.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:46.080]   So let us just take a moment to encounter that grace right now.
