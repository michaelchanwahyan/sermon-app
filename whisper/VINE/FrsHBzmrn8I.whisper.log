[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   Amen. Thank you, Jason.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.440]   Let's give Jason a round of applause.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.440]   That was a great leading.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.080]   And congratulations to June.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.080]   June has been accepted.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.480]   I'm so touched to see her being selected
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.960]   and to see how she has helped us improve our book.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.400]   Congratulations to everyone.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.040]   Because today is the last day of the audition.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.040]   I don't know how you feel about the last 21 days of the audition.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.840]   I heard everyone was sharing their experiences.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.400]   The two ladies next to me were sharing their experiences.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.440]   I was talking to them.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.640]   And I found out that they had some experiences.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.440]   Maybe we'll share them together later.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.280]   Today is the last day of the auditions.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.000]   I don't know how you feel about the last 21 days of the audition.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.640]   What do you feel when you start the audition?
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.640]   What do you expect?
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.800]   I remember when I first started this year,
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.320]   and I wrote the book for the first time,
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.480]   I was looking forward to what God would say to me.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.920]   Especially last year,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.640]   when we entered a new stage of life.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.240]   My wife and I were both thinking,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.440]   we were both servants,
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.560]   we were both thinking,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.880]   "After marriage, how will God use us?"
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.640]   "How will He serve us?"
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.400]   "How will we use the past two years?"
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.000]   I still remember the first week,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.920]   when we started to eat lunch,
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.920]   I simply couldn't believe
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.960]   how God would keep talking to us that week.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.560]   I was looking forward to every day of prayer,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.600]   because you never know what God will say to you the next day.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.080]   It was like God was giving us His will every day.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.880]   Not only in the proclamation,
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.960]   but also when we were in our lives,
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   when we were going through struggles,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.800]   God was slowly showing us.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.320]   I remember when we were 15, 16 years old,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.760]   we were making decisions,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.440]   and we didn't know how to apply them.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.600]   God was actually opening doors for us,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.520]   to give us a chance.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.040]   When we were worried,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.920]   and we were looking for something,
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.880]   when we were talking about how to deal with things,
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.560]   we received a phone call,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.760]   and God was slowly opening doors for us.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   On the one hand, we were very excited,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   God was talking to us like that.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.040]   On the other hand, we were looking forward to
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.040]   what would happen the next week.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.800]   Would there be someone to give us a service offer?
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   Or what?
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.560]   But when I went into the prayer the next week,
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.240]   the direction, the content of the prayer,
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.560]   even the tone was very different.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.280]   God made me think of many people,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.280]   many things,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.160]   many passages from the past sermons,
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.480]   many points,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.880]   or many emotions, many thoughts.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.360]   The last time I had a speech,
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.200]   I was asked many questions.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.560]   "God, do you really want me to do this?"
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.800]   "God, God,
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   how can I fix these complicated relationships?"
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.360]   "My life's problems, my life's struggles,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.120]   have been going back and forth for so many years,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.960]   and they are repeating over and over again.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.000]   How can I find a way out?"
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.680]   "In this state, I can still serve you."
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.920]   "What if I hear wrongly?
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.920]   What then?
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.480]   What should I eat tonight?"
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.440]   This is not it.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   But as a servant, as a missionary,
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.480]   the questions I just asked,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.880]   it seems like you have a basic answer,
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.400]   you should know some answers,
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.000]   but they are very real.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.720]   These are the struggles I had that week.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.240]   These are the weeks
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.680]   that I think about,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.840]   or the situation inside me,
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.480]   the real situation.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.440]   Richard Foster,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.440]   in "The Early Morning Prayer,"
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.000]   quoted a poet to describe prayer.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.840]   He said, "When we pray,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.480]   God will slowly, gently,
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.240]   show us our hidden,
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.600]   or our so-called life situation,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.280]   and reveal our life."
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.200]   Yes, I think it's very real.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.800]   When we pray with all our heart,
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.320]   when we know,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.680]   we will know more and more
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.400]   about the light of our life.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.200]   Life is not just a place with light, right?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.480]   It also has a shadow.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.880]   Our life is not always
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.800]   full of beauty.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.680]   Sometimes,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.680]   or many times,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.280]   our life,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.960]   or the world we live in,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.400]   our spiritual life,
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.000]   is full of tension,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.600]   full of struggle.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.840]   Our life is sometimes full of two sounds.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.120]   One is,
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.960]   "I only know that God is love.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   I know that I want to be immersed
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.440]   in a relationship with God.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.120]   I also want to hear God say every day,
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.440]   "I am in Him, I am valuable.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.720]   We also have a mission.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.760]   We are also people.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.800]   God wants us to love,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.840]   to serve,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.880]   to touch.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.480]   But on the other hand,
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.120]   we know that our life is full of problems,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.960]   many difficulties,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.720]   or some very difficult,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.160]   very annoying things
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.520]   are inside us.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.080]   We need to face and deal with them.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.680]   They can be
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.400]   some very complicated dynamics in front of you,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.600]   some very complicated relationships,
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.120]   or some situations that we love,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.480]   our family members,
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.240]   or our loved ones,
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.120]   or some unknown things that are ahead of us,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.800]   or some unfinished things in our lives,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.320]   some relationships,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.600]   our self-doubt,
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.440]   or even some harm that we don't want to be aware of,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.640]   or even some sins.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.880]   These two voices bring us tension,
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.320]   bring us inexplicable anxiety,
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.600]   and even
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.840]   entangle us in our prayer
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.880]   of how to listen to God.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.960]   In a small town in Spain,
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.560]   there was a young pastor
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.440]   who received a phone call on Friday night.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.840]   He was preparing dinner with his wife.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.920]   While preparing, his wife said, "I'm going to listen."
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.520]   He went out to listen.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.360]   When the pastor was preparing,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.880]   he was looking back at
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.120]   the habit he had been repeating
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.800]   for a long time.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   He was meeting an old pastor
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.400]   as his mentor.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.440]   The pastor suggested that he pray
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.760]   for an hour every day.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.920]   After his wife came home from work,
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.640]   he would pray for an hour at home.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.480]   He would spend time with God every day.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.760]   He would listen to God's words.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.080]   He would confirm his call.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.680]   He would confirm that he would serve God.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.760]   He was thinking that he would share a lot of things with his wife.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.040]   After a while, he thought,
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.360]   "Why hasn't my wife come home yet?"
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.960]   He went out to listen
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.200]   and looked at his wife.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.320]   At that time, his wife was holding her phone.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.880]   She didn't say a word.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.720]   She was like listening to her phone.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.880]   The whole hall was quiet.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.880]   The only sound was the voice
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.280]   from the phone.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.400]   The pastor thought it was strange.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.720]   He picked up the phone and listened.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.160]   When he listened,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.240]   he was not a stranger.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.840]   He was a friend of his.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.000]   He was a very familiar friend of his.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.120]   He was actually a friend of his.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.960]   When he listened,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.840]   he was scolding them.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.160]   He did a lot of things to hurt them.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.720]   Do you know how he hurt other people?
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.160]   He even said something that he didn't remember.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.680]   He kept scolding them.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.360]   He only remembered the last sentence.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.760]   He said, "You don't have to look after me and my family anymore."
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.240]   Then he stopped.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.920]   At that time, he didn't know how to react.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.520]   He listened to the phone and looked at his injured wife.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.920]   He had a lot of questions.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.560]   They didn't eat the dinner that night.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.160]   They finished their work and went to bed.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.320]   But they couldn't sleep.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.640]   The pastor was thinking, "What happened?
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.240]   What did I do wrong?
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.520]   Why did you scold me like this?
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.320]   It's not fair.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.600]   Why can this happen to us?"
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.120]   He couldn't sleep that night.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.800]   He was even thinking,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   "In this place, there are so many things,
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.040]   I have so many problems,
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.800]   so many hurts.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.160]   How can I continue to serve God?
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.520]   How can I continue to walk?
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.560]   Yes, we will struggle in our lives.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.560]   I don't think anyone can do better than that.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.600]   Even a person who serves God can't do better than that.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.640]   Even if we have so many good experiences in the Bible,
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.720]   sometimes when a small thing happens,
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.480]   a small movement appears,
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.320]   it can easily overthrow our previous experience
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.480]   and bring a lot of struggles to our lives.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.360]   When I think about this week
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.080]   or these three weeks of my Bible experience,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.680]   I think about what kind of people are in the Bible,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.440]   or even Jesus,
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.040]   how he experienced these struggles,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.760]   how he faced the times when he struggled in his life.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.320]   I think of the Gospel we are going to read today.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.200]   Although Jesus is the God of all things,
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.480]   but he took the form of a human being to come to this world.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.120]   He is also a man of all things.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.040]   He will face struggles in his life.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.480]   He also has feelings.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.760]   When he faces the people who are against God in the Bible,
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.040]   he will be angry.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.720]   When he faces his beloved Lazarus,
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.240]   he will be sad.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.560]   When he faces those who are against God,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.640]   you don't understand how to teach them.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.320]   He will be annoyed.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.480]   When he faces those who are in the midst of hardship,
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.440]   he will feel sad.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.200]   But the Bible says,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.240]   even if it is Jesus who has different struggles
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.200]   or different feelings,
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.760]   the Bible says that Jesus never committed a crime.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.560]   He is a man who never committed a crime.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.680]   He has experienced many trials,
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.680]   but he never committed a crime.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.920]   Today, we will use Jesus' last sermon.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.040]   Before he was captured,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.360]   Jesus' last prayer
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.600]   is to use this sermon to see how God
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.640]   will tell us how to do in the midst of struggle.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.280]   Let's pray together.
