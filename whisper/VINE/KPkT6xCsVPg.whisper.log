[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Amen.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Thank you, guys.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I feel like...
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hi.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:19.620]   I feel like I've preached enough now to not make the common mistake of saying, "Good morning,"
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.620]   when it's 2 PM.
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.620]   So good afternoon, everyone.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.620]   How are you guys doing?
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.620]   All right.
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.480]   I did this at 9.15, but I feel like I'm gonna do it for you guys, too, so you understand
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.480]   what it means.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.760]   I'm gonna say, "Good afternoon, fam."
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.720]   That's how black people say, "Good afternoon."
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.720]   That's our way of doing it.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.720]   So now you know.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.040]   I just taught you something nice and cultural.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.800]   Today we're gonna spend some time, speaking of culture, furthering what Pastor Ellison
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.400]   talked about last week, looking at diversity, at ethnic groups, at just what God was doing
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.480]   in all of this bringing together concept.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080]   Today's gonna be meaty.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.920]   It's a massive passage, but I'm gonna break it down and show it's exactly our focus point
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920]   and what it's gonna look like.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.720]   So please do not be overwhelmed when you see 13 verses appear.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.360]   I'm gonna read all of them so we get context and understand what's happening, but we will
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.440]   break it down and we'll have bite-sized chunks.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.040]   So let me start by looking here at Ephesians 3, verses 1 through 13.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.440]   I'm gonna read it aloud for us all.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.880]   It says this, "For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus, for the sake of
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.240]   you Gentiles, surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.400]   given to me for you, that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.420]   already written briefly.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.440]   In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.440]   Christ, which was not made known to people in other generations as it has been revealed
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.840]   by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.960]   This mystery is that through the gospel, the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.080]   together of one body, and sharers together of the promise in Christ Jesus.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.440]   And I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given through the working
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.440]   of His power.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.560]   And although I am less than the least of the Lord's people, this grace was given to me
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.680]   to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ and to make plain to everyone the
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.520]   administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God who created
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.520]   all things."
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.320]   Now, verse 10 is gonna be our anchor verse, our focal point, so definitely dial in for
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   this.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.840]   It says this, "His intent was that now through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.020]   be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms according to His eternal
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.520]   purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.400]   And in Him, through faith in Him, we may approach God with freedom and confidence.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.040]   I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my suffering for you, which are
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   your glory."
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.200]   So, God, we come before you and we open your word.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.640]   And Holy Spirit, we just ask that they just won't be preaching or reading.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.040]   God, we know that your word is living and active, and we just ask that you would soften
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.840]   our hearts to be able to hear what it is that you have to say, what it is that your word
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.520]   spells out for us, that it will inspire, that it will give us the courage to be the people
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.720]   that you've called us to be.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.320]   So, yeah, we give you this time.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.280]   We ask you to help minimize any distractions in our minds or in our hearts and allow us
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   to have a focus.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280]   So, in the name we pray, amen.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.200]   Now, like I said, these 13 verses, that's a long bit.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.160]   I'm pretty sure you don't remember what the first verse was.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.720]   So, let me summarize what all of this says so we know where we're going.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   All right.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.040]   So, if you were to take this whole concept and boil it down into one phrase or one sentence,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.480]   it'd be this, that the mystery of the reconciliation of all humanity to God and to one another,
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.200]   when it's displayed and illuminated through the church, it will powerfully reveal God's
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.880]   manifold wisdom to the rulers of the world.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.880]   All right.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.040]   So, last week, if you were here, Pastor Ellison led us through chapter two of Ephesians, which
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.400]   has a lot to do with people and with them coming together, ends up being the building
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.120]   block to the concept of reconciliation.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.560]   When I say reconciliation, just so we're all on the same page, to reconcile is to take
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.800]   two things that were against each other that are broken apart and to bring them together,
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.200]   not just at peace, but unified working together for a joint purpose.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   All right.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.560]   So, they are together, not just next to each other.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.400]   And actually, I heard quite a few comments.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.800]   I'm going to disclose some information.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.000]   I'm one of the people who's behind our social media.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.280]   So, I get to see all of your reposts every week and the things that you guys find awesome
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   and interesting.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.480]   And a lot of you had a lot to say about what Pastor Ellison shared last week.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.880]   There was a lot of positive comments of how, man, that was a timely message.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.880]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.880]   That's what I needed to hear.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.840]   And I'm glad that we were able to experience that because to really understand Ephesians
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.600]   2 is to challenge the potential prejudices that we might hold in our hearts unseen and
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.080]   how Christ has made a way so that there is no outsider.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.800]   And in that reality, we as a church must also commit to welcoming anyone that comes through
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.200]   our doors no matter where they come from.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.560]   We as a family of God cannot reserve our hospitality and our acceptance and our kindness just for
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.280]   people who are like us or like-minded to us.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.680]   But if the gospel is true, then we have to open up our arms and challenge our prejudices,
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680]   right?
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.680]   Really figure out what it means.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.640]   This is Ephesians 2, and I know I'm repeating, but it's what the first 10 verses of Ephesians
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.360]   3 actually are talking about as well.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.320]   This concept of God bringing together this new humanity now with the same promises that
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.040]   he had for Israel will now be what he's given to the Jews and the Gentiles.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.920]   Paul is both highlighting and clarifying a mystery to the church, showing that this
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.360]   is actually the reason he's in prison.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.000]   So he ends up getting in prison.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.320]   You can read this in Acts, but he ends up in trouble because he as a Jewish man is teaching
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.280]   the gospel of Christ to non-Jewish people, and it is driving everyone crazy.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.160]   And so he ends up in prison for this.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.240]   So he is saying, "This is the reason I'm here, my mission to evangelize, to share the good
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.200]   news of Jesus, not just to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles."
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.800]   So all of this will impact the way that Paul expects us as the church to live, how we treat
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.400]   one another with dignity and with respect.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.280]   So because of Christ, we now find peace with one another and we find unity with one another.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.040]   And this would have been pretty groundbreaking.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.800]   So the way that the Jews and the Gentiles lived is that they just did not mix.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.000]   They did not go together.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.160]   They were separate people.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.040]   They had different backgrounds, they had different practices, and they did not come together.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.480]   And so when the audience of Ephesians would have been reading or listening to this letter
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.800]   read aloud to them, this would have been groundbreaking information.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.920]   This would be, "Whoa, that's not normally how we operate."
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.880]   It would have been a shock to them naturally.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.240]   And what Paul is going to do is he's going to take that shock that you see in chapter
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.760]   two and the first 10 verses of chapter three, and he's going to expound on it more, explaining
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.160]   not just what we ought to do, but he's going to give us some theology around it.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.520]   He's going to trace some things back, and I'm going to hopefully be able to show you
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.920]   where these origins of these ideas come from.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.720]   So starting at verse 10 again, we see that Paul properly outlines and brings us this
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.600]   description of the church.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.720]   He introduces it to us here.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.680]   He defines the purpose of the church and why it exists.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.640]   Ephesians 3.10, "His intent was that now through the church, a manifold wisdom of God should
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.040]   be made known."
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.600]   So observe and notice what Paul does here.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.880]   See if you can catch onto the components of what church is based off of what he says.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.520]   Because I think if we are honest with ourselves, potentially we tend to harbor these beliefs
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.400]   that actually don't line up cohesive with what Paul is saying.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.200]   When Paul speaks of church here, he doesn't speak of a Sunday.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.660]   He doesn't speak of a temple.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.360]   He doesn't speak of a service.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.360]   There's no preacher mentioned here.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.000]   There's no worship team mentioned here.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.920]   No, when Paul speaks of church, he speaks of people.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.960]   He speaks of a people, a group of people.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.920]   But Paul uses the word ecclesia, which is the Greek word he used to describe a gathering
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   or an assembly.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.000]   But more specifically in this case, when it refers to the church, the word has a connotation
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.400]   of a called out assembly, assembled for a purpose.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.520]   I was walking here this morning at like seven something.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.000]   I'm like, "It's such a cheesy thing.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.200]   I never want to be a cheesy pastor."
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.960]   But I thought of like Avengers assemble, right?
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:29.480]   Like in my mind, like the church is like this gathering assembled, unified for a purpose.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   So stay with me.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.800]   This whole idea of unity and peace gathered together, it all is meant to lead to this
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.920]   expression called the church.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.080]   This called out assembly.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.700]   This group of people with diverse backgrounds and cultures together and unified, called
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.800]   out under the banner of Jesus.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.520]   See all this time, this is what's tricky to the Jews here, all this time, God's plan was
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.200]   bigger than they had realized.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.840]   So we start with Abraham.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.720]   God introduces himself in the Old Testament to Abraham and ultimately introduces himself
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.760]   to the world through Abraham.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.080]   And through Abraham, we get the nation of Israel who are now the people of God who are
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:14.120]   living under his covenant and following his rule and his reign.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:20.280]   And God sets them apart, redeems them, sends Jesus to reconcile them into relationship
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   with him again, salvation through grace by faith, all those things that we know.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.080]   But then we realize here that actually God's plan was never just for Israel.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.480]   It was a bit bigger than the people would have understood.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.080]   And that's why it would have been a shock to them.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.440]   It would have been encouraging them into a different way of seeing things.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.200]   If we look back more closely at Abraham's covenant, we would see that God makes these
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.560]   bold statements that he would, you know, bless those who blessed Abraham and curse those
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.960]   who cursed Abraham, and he would make him fruitful in the land and would multiply this
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.200]   and would just bless his whole existence.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:10:00.880]   But the last bit of that promise, what he tells to Abraham is this, that through you,
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   I will bless all the nations.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.720]   Now not through you, I will bless your lineage only and your people.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.960]   Through you, I will bless the whole nation.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.360]   This is the meta-narrative of Scripture, that God is not just for one people group.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.040]   This has been the plan all along.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.680]   When Paul says it here, he would say it in verse 11, and he would phrase it like this,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.960]   this was all according to the eternal purpose.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.520]   This was something that God had in mind from the beginning, the reconciliation of all people.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.620]   God may have introduced himself through the people of Israel, but he had no intention
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.040]   on remaining a mono-ethnic God.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:47.400]   The most famous Bible verse in all of Scripture, John 3, 16, "For God so loved the world, humanity,
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.720]   people, all of us, he so loved all of us that he would send his Son."
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.240]   The epistles would have it where Paul or Peter would say that Christ would desire that all
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:04.080]   would be saved, not just some, not just one special group of people, Christ for all people.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:10.240]   And that ends up being this whole mystery that Paul illuminates in verses 6 through
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.720]   10, that before it was hard for people to see, but the whole purpose at the end of the
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.560]   day was never just God for the Jewish people.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.800]   It was God for the world.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.560]   That is what he was trying to get them to see, and that's what he was making clear at
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.560]   this moment.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.040]   So I feel like for the first century readers, when they were to hear this letter read out
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.760]   loud to them, their first questions are like, first of all, they're like, "What?"
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.720]   But then secondly, they're like, "How?
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.800]   How do you bring together all these people and all together under one rule and all together
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   as God's people?
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.240]   What does that even look like?
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.320]   Do we convert to their practices or do we just convert them to our practices?"
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.240]   Ellison said circumcised like 50 times in two minutes last week, the idea of making
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.000]   people more like the Jews, but that's actually not what God's heart is, right?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.520]   He says, "No circumcised or circumcised, it doesn't matter."
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.480]   He's not about changing Gentiles into Jewish people, nor is he about demonizing the Jewish
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.320]   customs and making them Gentile.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:15.120]   No, he's looking for and creating a new humanity, a new gathered community reconciled together
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.320]   that is called the church.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.960]   That is what we are.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.160]   And this speaks to the significance of the church.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.200]   This gives value and tells us that the church matters and that the church is important.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.120]   And if the church is important, we've got to really understand the details of what makes
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.520]   the church the church, right?
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.640]   We've got to understand exactly what is a church because coming on a Sunday, 9, 15,
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:47.600]   11, or 2 o'clock, and listening to someone preach does not qualify as church.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.040]   Coming and listening to great worship, maybe even raising your hand, you kind of can't
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.480]   come to church.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.080]   That's not the vision of what church is in this bit, and we have to understand what church
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.680]   means, what God desires a church to be if we're going to be a church of impact.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.080]   It actually makes a difference in our city.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.360]   So let me explain it this way.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.240]   The church initiates or is initiated by God.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.240]   It is His idea.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.600]   I think beautifully phrased, we could say that the church is a community made up of
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.800]   different nations and backgrounds and tribes and tongues and different experiences, all
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.560]   redeemed by the blood of Jesus and right standing with Him, reconciled to God.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.560]   That sounds good?
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.560]   That's okay?
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.240]   Everyone okay with that?
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.800]   That's nice, but that's incomplete.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.480]   It sounds good, but it's actually more to the picture.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:46.280]   The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus was not only to provide us reconciliation
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.280]   to God.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.280]   Do we know that?
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.840]   Like it's not just about making sure that us and God are in right standing relationship.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.680]   If we trace the biblical narrative further back to Genesis 3, we would see that before
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.000]   the fall and after the fall, a couple of things change.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.360]   There's a couple of broken fractures that are introduced by sin.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.200]   The first one is pretty obvious, right?
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.680]   When Adam and Eve sin, God shows up to, "Oh, hey buddy.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.080]   Guys, this is my son.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.080]   Isn't he the best?"
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   It's never happened before.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.080]   Okay.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.080]   Back to my question.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.080]   It's never happened before.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.080]   Okay.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.080]   Back to what I'm saying.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.160]   In Genesis 3, when Adam sins, the first thing that changes about his relationship with God
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.160]   is this.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.440]   God comes looking for Adam.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.920]   And rather than walking in the cool of the evening like Adam used to do with God, what
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   happens?
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.000]   Adam is hiding from God.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.560]   Adam doesn't want to be seen.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.560]   There is a distance.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.840]   There is a disconnect.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   There is a gap.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.960]   There is a fragmented relationship, right?
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.360]   So that's the obvious one.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:47.160]   And so Jesus comes and dies, redeems us back to right standing with God.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.640]   But there's something else that happens in that Genesis story that we have to think about.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:59.440]   When God approaches them about their sin, Adam responds in a very rude way.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.720]   He says, "The woman that you gave me, the woman that you..."
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.040]   Him and Eve would have been one beforehand, right?
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.160]   We get the whole biblical picture of marriage from pre-fall.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.240]   They were unified together, one flesh, one body.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.520]   And after sin, he distances himself.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:26.040]   Humanity ends up in this broken relationship at enmity with one another.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.920]   We can go really, really, really deep on this, but I'm going to move forward.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.040]   Sin did leave humanity at war with one another, right?
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.080]   It left us looking for peace and longing for reconciliation and not finding it.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.920]   I mean, the next generation of Adam's family, what happens to the two brothers?
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.240]   One murders the other.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:51.400]   Is there any more clear picture of a broken humanity in the relationship with one another?
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.880]   The mystery, however, of the gospel is that, yes, Jesus came and he died and he was risen
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.720]   again to life so that we could be redeemed with him, but he also was risen back to life
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.920]   so that humanity could be redeemed again with humanity.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:12.240]   God doesn't just care about our vertical reconciliation and righteousness with him.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.920]   It matters that we are reconciled to each other.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:22.280]   And humanity reconciled to God and to one another is primarily meant to be expressed
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.720]   through the church.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   That's why we exist.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.400]   The church is meant to be evidence to the world of that reconciliation, both of us to
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.760]   God and to us and each other.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.280]   It's meant to be seen.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.200]   The church exists to be this living example in all of its flaws and struggles and imperfections,
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:48.320]   yet filled with hope and grace of the reconciliation that's happened for humanity with God and
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.360]   with itself.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.580]   This is who Christ's church is.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:58.560]   This is his bride, this counter-cultural wild picture that ends up being a spark of life
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.040]   but speaks a meaningful purpose to who we are.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.240]   And it's for that reason that we can't just come to church.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.040]   It doesn't really work.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.080]   You can't just check it off a list of something you did this week and feel good about your
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.080]   spirituality.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.520]   Church is not a place or a location or a building.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.520]   Church is a people.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.280]   It's the unified people, God bringing together people of these different backgrounds under
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:26.920]   the banner of who Jesus Christ is, reconciled with God, living out that reconciliation with
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.920]   one another.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.080]   This is the reason that we have the river model at the Vine.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.980]   We say that church is not a building, therefore we're not going to put all of our efforts
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.440]   into making a really cool and awesome building.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.200]   Instead, the church is wherever the people go out into the city, carrying the presence
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.480]   of God, carrying his goodness, and filling a dry and thirsty land with the water of life.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:51.160]   What you do as the church brings life to where you go.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.000]   That's why you'll hear it said by almost every service leader, by almost every pastor, especially
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.440]   Pastor Andrew, that church is more than a 90 minutes on a Sunday.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:06.200]   Because we exist for such a more grand purpose.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.520]   It's people living under this lordship of Jesus, bringing evidence to the world of the
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.440]   new humanity that God has created.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:17.480]   Now look, in order to do this, what it means is we have to live in community.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.880]   It means that we have to be doing something together outside of Sunday, specifically your
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.880]   Monday to Saturday.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.120]   Because we can all gather once a week, that's not that challenging to do.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.160]   But man, to live this out means that Monday through Saturday, the church has to be made
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.040]   manifest in showing God outside of here.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.920]   Because we have to do the things that community does, that a new reconciled community does.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.920]   Things like praying for one another, things like supporting one another, hearing what's
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:50.000]   going on, sitting and bearing one another's burdens, forgiving each other, walking out
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.040]   all these fruits of what the church is meant to be.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.560]   And the reality is that you kind of can't do that on a Sunday just in an auditorium
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.320]   listening to me speak.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.600]   You kind of can't bear Taz's burden while I'm talking to you, could you?
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.760]   That's a bit challenging.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.040]   But outside of a Sunday, you could.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:16.320]   So I think this calls us and encourages us to live as a church, yes, gathered on a Sunday,
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.340]   but also in community and out in our city throughout the rest of the week.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.080]   This is how God designed the church to be.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:30.040]   Not a service, not a place that you come to, but a people being evidence to the world,
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:35.280]   a living example just by the mere fact that we can be so different and not let that tear
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.800]   us apart.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.040]   Just by the fact that we can come from different cultures, have different value systems, have
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.120]   different hierarchy of what we consider the most valuable thing, maybe even have different
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.600]   political ideologies and not let that splinter us.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   Right?
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.560]   Have you ever stopped and think about how crazy it is that God would do this, that he
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.400]   would want to bring these people together?
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.200]   That's not natural.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.040]   That doesn't happen, especially in today's society where culture gives us this hyper
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.960]   focus on, you know, separating people, perpetuating and creating separate and unique, distinct
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.080]   identities that separates me from you.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.880]   Where I'm different than you because I'm not like you, so I'm this.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.720]   Where it creates more barriers and it does solutions.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.480]   It creates more individual groups of people than a unified groups of people together.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:31.040]   It ends up being not united or unifying, but rather ends up being society siloed.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.240]   When our reactive ideologies, the only way they unify us is when we unify against someone
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.800]   else, right?
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.440]   We draw our line in the stand, I'm on this side of the camp, I believe this, so I'm against
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.720]   that.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.920]   That's the narrative of society.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.800]   I think if you're a little older, for all of our older generations here, I think you'd
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.400]   have heard the phrase, "Birds of a feather flock together," right?
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.200]   It's all about finding the people that are like you and having your own special thing
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.760]   that's not like them because you think this way and you believe this way.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.720]   That's not...that's natural.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.480]   That's how our society functions and operates.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.840]   There's no middle ground.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.320]   It splinters humanity and it divides humanity.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.240]   The world and all of its wisdom doesn't actually pull you together.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.360]   It gives you more reasons to be apart.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.360]   And I feel like this experiment that God has can't work.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.000]   It's not supposed to work.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.720]   You know, it's the me first mentality of me and my clan, me and my people.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.160]   How do you do that and be reconciled and unified with other people and care about their needs
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.160]   equally?
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:38.480]   It feels impossible, so impossible that it feels like some weird hippie euphoria dream.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.600]   But the reality is that that's precisely what Christ is looking for.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.600]   So we have pushed it because it seems so unachievable because our culture is so loud and it's splintering
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.120]   that unity and being unified is something that's unachievable.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.880]   But Christ is setting up his church as designed it to be that, what we would call an alternative
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.960]   society, a new humanity.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:06.360]   A people where there is no special privilege because of your education or because of your
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.840]   employment status or because of the amount of zeros in your bank account, where there's
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.240]   no disadvantage because of where you came from or how you got to Hong Kong.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:21.080]   A group of people where there's this general sense of equality and equity amongst us.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:27.120]   And I think when the church lives out this way of seeing everyone in that imago dei lens,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.200]   the image of God in every single person, it ends up becoming the birthplace, the breeding
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:38.680]   place for fairness, for liberty, for justice, where the poor are treated with the same respect
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.920]   that the rich are treated with, where there's shared fellowship and where we care for our
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:48.040]   neighbors, where the alien is not taken advantage of but there's a voice for them, where the
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.520]   widows and the orphans are protected, where the vulnerable are spoken up for.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.740]   See, when the church lives this way, it displays the wisdom of God.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.280]   It displays the way of God.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.380]   It shows something on full display.
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:10.760]   It shows his kingdom, which we would pray in Matthew, "Your kingdom come, your will
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.760]   be done."
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:17.400]   When the church lives as this reconciled humanity, you don't have to pray it, we live it.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.880]   We get to be his kingdom come here.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.200]   Pastor Ellison said something last week that has been sitting in my head, living rent-free.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:33.080]   He made the comment that the church is not meant to reflect culture.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.160]   I feel like I 100% agree.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.380]   I think we can all agree with that.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:43.540]   But I think when I thought about it a bit, I felt like so often the church kind of looks
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.360]   just like the world.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.120]   It doesn't look that different.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.680]   Well, because we sing?
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.680]   That's not...
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.240]   You can go to a concert and sing.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.240]   Listen to someone talk?
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.120]   There's TED Talks all around the city.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.480]   It doesn't look that different from what we see on the world.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:06.680]   The church is not meant to reflect the culture and the present day values, but so often and
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.000]   so easily it does.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   No, the church actually has a more grand and intentional purpose.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.440]   The church is this, it's God's wisdom on display.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:25.480]   We exist to display something, and that thing specifically is the wisdom of God.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.680]   This idea of us being displayed and being visible is not introduced in Ephesians 3.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:37.160]   It's something that if you paid attention to the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5 through
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.680]   7, Jesus talks about.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.760]   He would say when speaking of his people that they...
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.000]   He goes, "You are a light on a hill to be seen."
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.080]   He would say that you don't light a lamp to hide it.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.000]   So I grew up Baptist, kind of Baptist, first Pentecostal, then Baptist, very confusing.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.440]   But in my latter times of being Baptist, we used to sing this song at Sunday school.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.800]   This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it...
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   Someone knows it.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.520]   This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.880]   This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.480]   Let it shine, let it shine.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.480]   Did I just sing that?
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.880]   I always told myself I would not be that pastor.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   Wow.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.000]   I'm glad this is not the live stream.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.120]   My dad would judge me.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.120]   My dad's a pastor as well.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.920]   Anyways, but you don't light a lamp and hide it.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.920]   That's the whole point.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:40.400]   You're supposed to be so different, so countercultural, this alternative society that you have to
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.160]   be seen because you look so different.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.540]   You are light to the world.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.740]   You are salt to the world.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.680]   You are yeast and dough to be seen, to make a difference.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.520]   When the church does this, it is seen and it's displayed.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.040]   Here's a nice little plus.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.660]   You don't have to be super evangelistic when the church does this because rather than going
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.160]   out and handing out a thousand tracts or trying to awkwardly say, "Do you know Jesus?"
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:07.500]   and make someone feel uncomfortable, actually, the church by doing this is attractive.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.600]   Who does not want to be a part of a community where everyone is loved and taken care of,
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.840]   where everyone is valued, where because you have the image of God in you, I love and respect
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.840]   you fully.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.920]   Nothing about your social status changes who you are because you are made in God's image.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.600]   A community that is for one another, meeting needs, praying together, the Acts community
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.120]   of the church, we're sharing all things in common.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:36.940]   This is so different than what we see, but this by nature, by being such a contrast,
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.040]   it attracts people.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.080]   It's like a moth to a flame, which is good for the whole light analogy.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.480]   I just came to me.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.480]   Cool.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.240]   I'm going to skip that next slide.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.680]   I don't think we need to talk about it.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:57.360]   The whole point of this is that we end up being a church where our vertical relationship
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:03.600]   and reconciliation with God extends into our horizontal reconciliation with one another.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.600]   That is what we're saying.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:09.280]   When we do that, when the church lives that way, it is God's wisdom on display.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.400]   One of my favorite examples of this is found, again, this one is in Luke.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.480]   Jesus is getting ready to teach and people are like, "Hey, some of the wisest people
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.480]   around, the teachers of the law, they come up to Jesus and they say, 'Yo, we have a question
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   for you.'"
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   They're doing this.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.040]   It says in the scripture that they're doing this to try and trap him.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.800]   They say, "Jesus, of all the 300 and however many commandments that there are, which one
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.520]   is the most important?"
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.520]   I love this.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.360]   They ask Jesus a question where the answer should be singular, it should be one answer.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.360]   Jesus in all of his awesomeness says, "I'm going to give you two answers."
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.160]   He goes, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength."
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.040]   Now this is something that every good Jewish person would have known, memorized, grown
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.840]   up, kind of living up.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:57.040]   He says that and then he says, "And," which I'm sure their ears perked up, "And love your
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.160]   neighbor as yourself."
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.800]   And then he goes on to give this story of a Samaritan who were people that were different,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.240]   slightly ethically different, mixed group of people.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.920]   The Samaritans were different than the Jews.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.880]   The Samaritans and the Jews hated one another.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:16.200]   This example of loving God and loving others is an example of a Samaritan.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:23.320]   This thing has just been sprinkled throughout, God reconciling all people together.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.480]   See the church when it does this is on display.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.040]   It's visible to the world.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.720]   And I love that we as a church don't have to...we don't have to worry about being cool.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.040]   We don't have to worry about, you know, having the latest this or the latest that or having,
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.840]   you know, cutting edge sermons or, I don't know, making a stand about this thing or just
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.200]   speaking because speaking is a thing.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.520]   To be seen doesn't mean we have to put ourselves out there.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:54.280]   I love this because Jesus would say in John 13, "For the world to know that you belong
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.020]   to me."
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.020]   What do you have to do?
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.020]   Do you have to make a lot of statements?
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.920]   Do you have to bash people in the head of the Bible?
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.520]   Do you have to be super religious?
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.440]   Do you have to pray nonstop?
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.480]   No, it's gonna love one another.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.900]   By your love for one another, they will know that you belong to me.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:18.080]   How easy yet profound just loving your neighbor is.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   That is the call.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.880]   That is reconciliation of humanity.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.640]   That's what God desires his church to be, a place where those who are reconciled with
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:33.860]   God now are reconciling with each other, coming together and being whole and being unified.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.840]   This is what the church is meant to show.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   However, Paul, like I love that I just spent like 20 minutes on that.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.640]   Paul's actual point in here is not for the world to see us.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.920]   Did anybody notice that?
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.000]   That kind of led us astray for a little bit.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.240]   He's not just talking about obviously, yes, when we do this, the world does see us, right?
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.720]   But his point is not so that the world can see us.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.280]   It's actually a bit different.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.520]   He in verse 10, I'm gonna read it one more time, see if you catch on to it.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.880]   His intent, meaning Jesus, was that now through the church, the manifold wisdom of God will
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.640]   be made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:17.240]   We're gonna talk about spiritual things, the things unseen, the spiritual realm.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:23.520]   And isn't that a wild concept that God's way of speaking to the spiritual world is through
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.080]   his physical people being reconciled together.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   So it's not just...
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.960]   And let me put this in context because Paul is also gonna talk about, you know, wearing
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.560]   the armor of God and all these things that we ought to do.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:42.240]   And before he says it in Ephesians 6, he would lay it up using similar language about how
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.040]   real the spiritual world is.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.480]   And I'm just saying this because I think it's easy for us to live just based off of what
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   we see, right?
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.800]   Like I see you, you see me, that's easy, cool.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.840]   But angels and demons and other creations, and as Ellison would talk about Nephilim and
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.160]   this and that, like, what even is that?
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.560]   Is that even there?
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.760]   So Paul would, before he even gets into the armor of God, he would say this in chapter
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:08.360]   6, verse 12, "For our struggle, for the battle that we wage, is not against flesh and blood."
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.120]   It's not just a bit about what you see.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:16.280]   It's not against people, but against rulers, similar word, rulers, against authorities,
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.360]   similar word, authorities, against the powers of this dark world, against the spiritual
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:27.080]   forces of evil in the heavenly realm.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.920]   There is a spiritual world, there is a spiritual battle.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.080]   It's not just what we see.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   And I think what's remarkable about this is that God is saying the church is important.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.600]   It matters, but not just for the physical.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:47.080]   The church matters because it displays God's wisdom to the spiritual world.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.280]   It's not just about us being reconciled to each other so we can be kumbaya.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.280]   We're making a statement to the spiritual world as well as the physical world.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.560]   Satan and his demons are pushed back by the church living in reconciliation.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.560]   Think about this.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.560]   This just hit me now.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.000]   Satan's whole plan to get back at God because he knew he could never defeat God was to go
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.400]   after his kids, was to go after his creation.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:16.680]   And so he ruptures relationship between man and man and between man and God.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:21.600]   And now God is taking the very thing that Satan thought he ruined and using it as a
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.760]   statement to say that God is victorious.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.080]   To say that the cross was not a joke.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:35.600]   The cross was not empty promises, but Jesus raised from the dead says something because
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.360]   look at the people that you brought sin into.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.040]   Look at how they've been made alive.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   They were once enemies.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.680]   They were once hostile to one another, but look at them now.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.080]   Through Jesus in them, through a reconciled relationship with Jesus, they can now live
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.840]   reconciled to one another.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.640]   Does that say that the church matters or what?
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:02.400]   It screams that we have something to do and we can't just have services once a week and
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.880]   think that is the church.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:09.920]   We actually, oh, we lose the meaning of church if we think it's a place that we come to once
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.380]   a week, right?
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.760]   We lose the meaning of church if we think church is over once we exit the door during
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.280]   the response song.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:26.860]   No, to be God's church is to live a certain way, to be an example outside of this building
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:32.120]   and inside of this building of yes, reconciliation between us and God, but also reconciliation
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.960]   between us and our neighbor.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.400]   God created the church this way on purpose.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:46.880]   This was his scheme for a reconciled universe, delivering a defeating blow to the enemy,
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:54.280]   displaying God as wise and as right, and his ways not only as higher than ours, but better.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:34:01.280]   So we, his church, are a physical statement to the spiritual realm that God is good and
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.320]   that he has redeemed man in his redeeming creation.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.280]   So let me summarize all of that because I know 13 verses, a lot of mystery, a lot of
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:15.680]   spiritual world, a lot of reconciliation, Jews, Gentiles, not as many circumcisions,
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.440]   but it's a lot of things to kind of put in together.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:25.920]   The reconciliation of humanity to God and to each other displayed and illuminated through
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:33.960]   the church, it reveals that God is wise, that the cross was victorious, not just to those
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:40.080]   outside of the church, but to the spiritual realm as well.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.120]   That gives us the significance of what the church is.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:48.040]   When we see that, we recognize that the church is not just a nice thing to have, it's deeply
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.040]   necessary.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.960]   It exists to serve a significant physical and spiritual purpose.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:00.120]   So us as a divine community, if we're to be this kind of people, it looks like loving
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:05.680]   each other on Mondays through Saturdays, not just coming on Sundays, right?
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.440]   If we're going to be that kind of community, it means getting involved in the justice work
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.800]   in our city because every single person is created in God's image, therefore they have
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.920]   inherent value, right?
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.320]   If we're going to be this kind of space, it means meeting together throughout the week
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.320]   in small groups, right?
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.440]   I've dedicated a small group and all of their kids this morning.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.480]   They all live in the Typo area and they get together every other week.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.320]   It could be as simple as that.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.340]   It could be, you know, maybe you're a busy businessman or woman and you have very little
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.000]   time in your day and you're at work all the time.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.760]   I'm pretty sure they give you a lunch break.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:47.240]   So maybe during your lunch break, once a week, you can gather with some people in that space
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.920]   and just create a space for maybe prayer, for encouragement.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.600]   What would it look like to, I don't know, not see everybody at your work as someone
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   to defeat?
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:01.480]   What would it look like to live and to practice out biblical values within the way you run
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.760]   your business?
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:08.240]   To not put profit as number one or me and my gains as number one, but the way that I
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.960]   do my things, the way that I live my life, the way that I engage in business to be displaying
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.840]   God's wisdom by me being reconciled with those around me.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.880]   Could it be that that's where God has called you in your sphere of influence?
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:29.360]   Could it just be that you get together and pray with people and pray for their needs?
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:37.060]   If all that's displayed is a good sermon or a really good worship team and nothing else
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.240]   happens throughout the week, we missed the point.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.740]   That's what I'm going to hark on.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.040]   If we listen to this and we're like, "Oh, that was a very moving sermon," and the next
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.800]   time we decide to be engaging in something spiritual is next Sunday, we've missed the
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   point.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:54.080]   We cannot allow church, we cannot boil down the meaning of church to just attending a
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.800]   gathering once a week.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   No, you were made for much more.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.320]   The church exists for much more.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:06.000]   God is wanting to utilize us and work with us in redeeming all of creation.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.360]   How vast of a purpose is that?
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.820]   It matters that you go out into your spheres of influence and you do the things you do.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.960]   It matters that you go and you be the church wherever that might be.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.760]   Don't just come to church.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.080]   Dare yourself to be the church wherever you are.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:27.920]   So let me wrap up by boiling it down to maybe two ways that we can practically think about
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.400]   this and questions we can ask ourselves as we consider what it looks like to take this
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.600]   reconciliation between me and God and the reconciliation between me and my neighbor
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.240]   and display God's wisdom through that because that's a big, big task.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.320]   Chapter two of Ephesians, chapter three of Ephesians, very similar.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.960]   Unity or peace in chapter two and unity in chapter three.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:52.720]   But all that requires us to ask ourselves this question, have we allowed the gospel
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:38:02.360]   to change us so fully that we can love whoever walks through these doors and into our community?
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.960]   Have we?
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:11.240]   Can we see those around us through the lens of Christ?
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.520]   This will impact how we talk to our domestic helpers.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:19.240]   This will impact how we treat the angry old lady who hits us with a cane on the train.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:24.040]   This will impact everything, every relationship we come in contact with.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.400]   If you see people as the image of God, as they are, this isn't like some fairy tale,
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.920]   God's image is in every single person.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.560]   Could we see them that way?
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:39.880]   And if we did, would we then allow them to have the same value that we have, precious,
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.160]   deeply valuable to God?
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.960]   Have you allowed the gospel to so fully change you that you would allow anybody into this
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   community?
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.000]   That's the first question.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.880]   I think when you wrestle with that, like the tips that Pastor Allison gave us last week,
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.160]   ask yourself what are the barriers?
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.520]   What are the things that are stopping me from seeing people the way Christ sees them?
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.200]   Is it race?
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.720]   Is it age?
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.760]   Is it culture?
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.200]   Is it political ideology?
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.400]   Maybe the easiest one, right?
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.640]   Do they have a different view about politics?
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.960]   I don't know.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.040]   All right.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.520]   Ask yourself what those things are.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.680]   Ask God to show you what those things are.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:24.960]   And ask him to give you the strength to acknowledge them and to submit them to his will.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:31.760]   And place those things so far second behind how primary you hold the unity that we have
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.440]   in Christ Jesus.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.440]   Ask his spirit to do that.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.680]   And what I think when you do, I think as he does that work and you're deepening that reconciliation
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.960]   in you and him, it will impact the way that you engage with your neighbor.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.480]   And the second thing is this.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.080]   You've heard me say the word river, river model, one of the things that we focus here
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.080]   at the Vine.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.920]   My question is how can we be a river?
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.520]   The church as a living example throughout the city.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.160]   Again, the church is not a building.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.560]   It's not a place you come to.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:04.240]   So if that's the case, do we dare to allow the unifying power of Christ to give us the
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.160]   courage to speak to those around us?
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.000]   Does the reconciliation of all humanity impact how generous we are?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.920]   If we see a need, if we see them as valuable, would we do something?
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.680]   Would it impact our willingness to engage in different justice efforts around the city
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.480]   to bring dignity to those who are vulnerable?
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.560]   A really fun and simple way, we have these things called neighborhood conversations where
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.240]   all you do is walk around and get to know our neighborhood.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:38.120]   Could the reconciliation of you and God leading to the reconciliation of you and your neighbor
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:43.160]   encourage you to maybe join a space where you just get to know the people in your neighborhood?
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.760]   Because I mean, if you're going to love them, you might as well maybe get to know them first,
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   right?
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.120]   Can you really love what you don't know?
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:55.920]   God would say this in 1 John that how is it that you don't love your brother who you can
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.160]   see, but you claim to love me who you can't see?
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.920]   All right?
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.320]   So could we take steps like that?
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.520]   Could we make a conscious effort?
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.520]   I know that we're busy.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.880]   I understand that Hong Kong's busy.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.200]   I have worked for a church, but I'm busy too.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   I get it.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.820]   But I think we remember that this is an eternal purpose from the beginning.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:20.360]   This was God's plan to bring people together to yes, reconcile us with him.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:27.120]   But man, the statement, the display that we are when we have different values and approaches
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:32.960]   and preferences and some people support like, is it Liverpool or what team do you like?
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.960]   Manchester United?
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.960]   Yeah, right?
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:41.000]   Like when Hudson can like Manchester United and I can still like Hudson, that says a lot
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.160]   about the reconciliation of God in this family.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:49.720]   I know it's a silly example, guys, but the cuts that do run in our society run quite
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.720]   deep.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.720]   All right?
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:56.200]   If we could allow what God has done for us and what he wants to take place in humanity
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.300]   to drive us into reconciliation with one another, we do become a light.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.440]   We do become salt to the earth.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.440]   Not salty.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.840]   We become salt to the earth.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.880]   And we display a wise, powerful, intentional God.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.440]   It invites people into our community.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.600]   It gives people value and inerrant worth.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.680]   And this is the mystery of the gospel.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.960]   This is what Paul is saying.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.760]   And this is my heart for our community.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.820]   This is Pastor Andrew and our elders.
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.120]   This is what they want this church to be.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:34.280]   Not just a group of people gathered, but people with differences, putting those things aside,
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.000]   counting it as lost because of the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ and the unifying
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.880]   work that he's doing in our reconciliation.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:50.240]   So would you stand with me and we'll pray together?
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:43:02.800]   Yeah, I recognize that this is a dense passage.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.560]   It's a lot of words.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.680]   But maybe for you it's just honing in on two or three things.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.720]   Or one or two things.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.020]   What it means to love our neighbor.
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.160]   That's what God is calling us to do.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.760]   To be reconciled with him and to be right standing with those around us.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:25.520]   If we boil it down to that, then what we're asking God for is a deepening of our reconciliation
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.360]   with him.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:34.720]   And the strength and the vision and the fortitude to be able to live that reconciliation with
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.120]   humanity intentionally displaying into the world.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.640]   That we would be a church that's not known for anything other than displaying the wisdom
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.640]   of God.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.960]   And it's his heart for us.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.560]   So maybe you have to ask yourself one of those two questions.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.040]   What does it look like to be so convinced by the gospel that I'd let anybody in?
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.800]   That I would love anyone around me?
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.920]   And God, I think for those of us who are asking ourselves that question, would you continue
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:11.240]   to flood us again anew with the meaning of your reconciliation with us?
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:16.960]   Would you remind us of the power of the blood and the power of your broken body and what
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:23.360]   that meant, what you endured, and just exactly what you did so that we could know you more.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.000]   So that there'd be no barriers between you and us.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.720]   That the veil is torn and we have access to a God.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:33.360]   You've made a way for us to know you, to walk with you, and for you to be present with us
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.360]   always.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:40.160]   God, I pray that you would just remind us of the joys of our salvation.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:46.280]   And that that would be the bedrock, that would be the foundation upon where we muster up
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.840]   the strength, knowing that we can only love because you first loved us.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:56.800]   God, may your example lead us bravely and boldly into acts of reconciliation with those
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   around us.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.600]   Give us the strength to forgive if that's what we need to do.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.320]   Give us the ability to listen.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:09.560]   God, give us the ability to assume the best about our neighbor, maybe not the worst.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.680]   Yeah, God, you know what it looks like for all of our spaces.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.760]   Would you speak into that?
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:21.120]   And Holy Spirit, for those of us who are pondering the question of what it looks like to go and
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:27.600]   be you displayed out into our society, to be a river that brings you to the world, I
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.040]   pray that you would give us the comfort of knowing that we don't go alone.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:37.440]   And actually what makes, what value we bring is the fact that you go with us.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.680]   And so would you comfort us?
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.080]   Would you give us ideas and suggestions?
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.560]   Would you illuminate what it looks like to live in a reconciled relationship with our
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:51.200]   coworkers, with our bosses, with those in our offices, with our families, with our communities,
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.760]   with those in Hong Kong?
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:58.880]   Could you show us what it looks like to truly bring the water of life to a dry and weary
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.320]   land?
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:09.480]   Could you let us see that the church is made for so much more?
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:15.520]   May we not just be a church that gathers and does church, but may we be a church that goes
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.200]   and carries the church outside of this building.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:25.480]   And may your wisdom, your manifold wisdom be on full display for the world and for the
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:31.520]   spiritual powers through this community of believers gathered in the name of Jesus.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.360]   Amen.
