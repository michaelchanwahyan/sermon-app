[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   We just thank you for him.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.200]   Would you guide us as a church?
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.080]   Would you lead us as a church, we pray.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.920]   Amen.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.040]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.240]   - Thank you, Justin.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.780]   And yeah, so Marian and I normally sit in this section
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.200]   at the 9.15, so this is exciting
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.440]   to be part of the 11.15 service.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.400]   And, or 11, it's 11 o'clock, isn't it?
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.480]   No, 11 o'clock service.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.480]   And Michelle, I think she maybe slipped out,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.960]   but what a gift to a church,
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.160]   to be able to pour yourself out in prayer for the church.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.320]   And the Vine is known as a church of prayer.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.200]   And this is, like I said, where we sit,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.840]   but everywhere you sit,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.020]   wherever other section you are in,
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.000]   whether you're at home right now, watching online,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.960]   we know that the Lord is a living God, and he speaks.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.240]   And he has a word for each one of us this morning.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.480]   And that's my prayer, is that we would have the humility
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.920]   to hear that word, and then the courage to live it out.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.000]   Because God wants us to go home blessed,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.800]   and that's what Jesus said,
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.140]   "Blessed are those who not only hear the word,
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.960]   "but then do the word."
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.000]   And so we'll pray for that courage for one another.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.480]   And keep praying for me as we go along.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.480]   So I work now at the University of Hong Kong,
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.700]   and I'm helping lead up a program there
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.000]   called Faith and Global Engagement.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.040]   And there's a number in the Vine
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.440]   who are also part of that program.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.300]   Basically what the program does,
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.500]   is it tries to put our faith, the Christian faith,
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.120]   into dialogue with contemporary society.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.680]   So what does it mean in contemporary society?
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.720]   So we do that a number of ways.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.740]   We do that through research,
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.200]   we do that through classes, public lectures.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.080]   But the way that I mainly engage in
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.540]   is through character leadership.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.640]   So trying to raise up the next generation of leaders
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.280]   as leaders of character.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.640]   So I've shared a few slides in the past when I've spoken,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.640]   but we'll share a couple here.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.660]   So this slide is just two weeks ago.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.200]   We had our mentor training.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.100]   So we have 100 mentors, 110 mentors in the program.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.500]   These are some of them for the training,
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.560]   and you might see your picture in there as well,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.640]   because some of the mentors come here from the Vine.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.320]   Then if we go to the next picture,
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.440]   this is Lead for Life, this is the program.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.440]   So there's about 550 students right now in the program.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.760]   In the next month, we're gonna add
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.600]   about another 180 to the program.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.280]   So pray for us.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.440]   But it's exciting, because what it is,
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   it's basically saying, how can we teach our students
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.820]   how to be with the character and the competence
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.260]   to build flourishing communities,
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.140]   or to nourish flourishing communities?
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.740]   So that's kind of the goal.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.860]   The next slide shows that you cannot have
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.020]   character leadership without beach balls.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.100]   Basically, that's the message of that slide.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.100]   Basically, this is taken from our year-end celebration again.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.620]   I thought about bringing some beach balls today,
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.620]   but then I thought, you know, you've had a hard day,
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.140]   a hard week at work.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.620]   You don't wanna get hit by a beach ball on Sunday morning.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.060]   So we can talk a little bit later
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.420]   about beach balls and character leadership.
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.140]   But the reason I wanted you to see those slides
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.620]   is because that's where I work.
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.380]   And the passage that we're going to look at this morning
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.700]   has challenged me in my work,
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.100]   and it's also encouraged me in my work.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.700]   And that's my prayer for you,
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.420]   wherever you work this morning.
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.140]   A couple of months ago, when Allison asked
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.380]   if I would be a part of this series with Encounter,
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.180]   and he said, "The topic is on Daniel."
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.780]   Well, Daniel is my boss at work, the name of my boss.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.580]   So I had to say yes as we came in.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.620]   But it's a topic, and in the passage,
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.300]   you'll see about going out.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.900]   I mean, last weekend with Branches of Hope,
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.940]   and Alex did a beautiful job of what it means
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.620]   to not just stay here in the box of our church,
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.400]   but that we go out.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.060]   And that's really what the Vine is.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.460]   Four years ago, when Marian and I joined this church,
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.380]   we were attracted to the river, that we go out,
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.500]   that we don't stay here in the church.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.540]   We don't only express our faith in our church
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.900]   and in our small groups.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.900]   There is a mathematician at Oxford, John Lennox,
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.900]   and he's a brilliant man.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.260]   If you wanna YouTube him,
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.100]   he has just beautiful expositions of the faith.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.900]   He's a mathematician, and he's written a book on Daniel
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.340]   called Against the Flow.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.820]   And one of the things he talks about in Daniel
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.260]   is he says this, he says,
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.180]   "Daniel, from the time he was a teenager
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.640]   "and he was forcefully removed from his home
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.200]   "to a foreign land until the time he was post-80,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.380]   "the whole of that life,
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.180]   "he managed to have his faith on the edge."
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.860]   But then he said this, "But too many of us,
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.100]   "we live in the boxes of our church,
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.980]   "we live in the boxes of our home,
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.060]   "and our faith is only at home or the church,
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.060]   "and it never gets out to where we spend most of our time."
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.660]   So that's the message this morning,
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.660]   is to challenge us to take it out.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.220]   How does our faith and work relate together?
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.660]   And I know that's tough.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.220]   I started my professional career with a company
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.700]   that's now called Accenture as a consultant,
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.180]   and living out your faith at work is tough.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.020]   It's tough at the university,
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.620]   it's tough in whatever area God has called you.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.320]   So where do you spend the majority of your time?
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.140]   Think about that.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.020]   It might be at home, working.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.940]   It might be working out of the home.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.180]   It might be in a school.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.920]   It might be your work right now is as a student.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.780]   It might be that you're in a lab,
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.140]   it might be you're in a studio,
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.340]   but wherever it is, what would it mean
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:34.180]   to fully express your faith through that work?
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.760]   And that's what we're going to look at.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.220]   Now, that's risky.
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.380]   We got Daniel in a lot of trouble.
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.380]   So the question is, do we want to read this passage or not?
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.780]   You want to read it?
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.660]   Okay, so we want to read it and we want to hear it,
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.060]   but do we want to do it?
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.400]   That's a yes too, right?
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.660]   [audience laughing]
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.940]   That's going to take courage.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.060]   So let's look at it together.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.180]   We're going to look at this passage,
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.340]   the whole of Daniel 6 together.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.580]   And Daniel 6 divides beautifully into three parts.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.020]   So I want you to imagine with me,
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.700]   this is like a Netflix docu-series, right?
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.420]   And we have three episodes coming together.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.700]   It's kind of like the Simone Biles docu-series, right?
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.460]   But you don't have to wait until October
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.140]   to find the ending, right?
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.980]   It's here.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.580]   And in this docu-series,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.660]   you have kind of the courage of Simone.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.340]   You've got a little bit of the office episodes mixed in,
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.060]   but you have the whole story of Daniel
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.140]   and what does it mean in his faith and his work, right?
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.260]   And with this, some of us kind of know Daniel
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.980]   from maybe the Daniel diet.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.260]   You remember the Daniel diet?
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.300]   Yeah, okay, so maybe we heard about Daniel diet.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.260]   It was a vegetarian diet, basically.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.380]   Others know us from this chapter,
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.460]   Daniel and the lion's den, right?
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.120]   And clearly the diet worked well
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.540]   because in Daniel and the lion's den,
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.900]   he's about 80 years old, right?
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.780]   And he's going strong.
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.700]   He's served under two national leaders already
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.860]   and he's serving now under a third.
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.460]   So we're gonna read through this passage together.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.180]   And as we do, what I ask is,
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.280]   really, we ask just one question.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.900]   And that question is actually one we ask every week
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.020]   here at the Vine.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.040]   What does the scripture over 2,500 years earlier
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.440]   have to say to us today?
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   The context of it is Babylonia is the superpower
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.480]   of the world at that time.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.000]   They've come down.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.800]   They've basically desecrated and sacked Jerusalem.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.360]   They've taken the teenagers of the elite families,
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.880]   the elite of the elite,
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.160]   because then they're gonna take them,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.660]   they're gonna put them in a leadership training program
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.900]   in Babylonia.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.420]   That's part of their enculturation.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.580]   Daniel was one of those.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.480]   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were his friends.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.420]   They were sent there as teenagers.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.440]   At this point where we're reading,
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.580]   Daniel is about 80 years old.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.740]   So we can look at it together.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.700]   You can see it on your screen.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.660]   If you brought your Bible, you can open it up,
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.240]   follow along if you have your Bible on your phone
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.740]   and you wanna mark it with there.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.940]   Sometimes I find that helpful as well.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.220]   But let's look at this first episode.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.760]   So Daniel 6, it pleased Darius the king
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.060]   to set over the kingdom 120 satraps.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.860]   Satraps sounds quite exotic,
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.380]   sounds like kind of something from the Dune movie,
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.300]   but basically these are government officials, right?
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.700]   Administrators.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.020]   And there was 120 of them over the whole kingdom.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.660]   And over these, there was three high officials
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.820]   of whom Daniel was one,
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.620]   and to whom these satraps should give account
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.980]   so that the king might suffer no loss.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.580]   Okay, so what basically he's saying here,
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.500]   he's given us the whole org chart, right?
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.620]   So we know where Daniel is in his position at work.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.500]   Then this Daniel became distinguished
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.660]   among all the other high officials and satraps
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.580]   because, and you can mark this,
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.460]   an excellent spirit was in him.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.100]   And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.740]   So he had a great future.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.740]   And then the high officials and the satraps
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.580]   sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.820]   with regard to the kingdom,
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.620]   but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.980]   because he was faithful.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.340]   No error or fault was found in him.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.500]   And then these men said,
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.100]   "We shall not find any ground for a complaint
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.340]   "against this Daniel unless it's in connection
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.860]   "with the law of God."
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.220]   In other words, this is where the faith
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.940]   and work comes into play.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.540]   And then these officials and satraps,
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.580]   high officials and satraps came by agreement to the king
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.740]   and they said to him, "O King Darius, live forever.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.280]   "All of the high officials of the kingdom,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.640]   "the prefects and the satraps, the counselors,
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.680]   "the governors, all are agreed that the king
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.900]   "should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.820]   "that whoever makes petition or prays to any God
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.060]   "or man for 30 days, except to you, O king,
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.740]   "shall be cast into the den of lions.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.440]   "Now, O king, establish the law and sign the document
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.660]   "so that it cannot be changed according to the law
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.660]   "of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked.
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.980]   "And therefore, King Darius, sign the document
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.180]   "and the injunction."
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.660]   Okay, so we'll pause there for a little bit
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.960]   because what we see is the trap has been set, right?
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.380]   The trap has been set for Daniel.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.900]   We see Daniel in the faith and work.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.820]   And basically, what we're looking at is
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.340]   what is this section that we've just read?
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.500]   How does that, what does that teach us?
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.320]   What's it about?
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.660]   And we kind of already know what it's about
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.640]   in terms it's about our faith and our work.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.060]   It's basically how our Sunday relates to our Monday.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.780]   It's like what you're doing right now,
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.700]   what will you be doing at 11, 30 or 12 o'clock tomorrow?
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.660]   It's about what the monks would talk about,
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.180]   aura and labora, prayer and labor coming together
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.620]   in a fully integrated way.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.980]   And I think most of us want that in our workplace.
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.700]   Question is, how do we do it?
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.860]   How do we do it?
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.540]   And so Daniel gives us a really nice model here.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.940]   And it's a model like any model
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.440]   that you have to adapt to your area.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.340]   But it's the model that we found in that verse
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.980]   that I called to our attention in verse three,
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.400]   because an excellent spirit was in him.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.040]   An excellent spirit was in him.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.180]   You know, we're talking about Alpha.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.220]   I love Alpha.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.180]   I think Pat is one of my heroes.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.220]   She heads up Alpha here in Hong Kong.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.260]   Every church I've been in, we've led Alpha.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.140]   I am so excited about the new Faith and Work Alpha
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:01.980]   that's coming out.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.160]   It's gonna be brilliant.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.380]   But when people ask me,
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.140]   'cause I know I'm about faith and work.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.420]   When people ask me, okay,
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:14.060]   how does you integrate your faith and your work?
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.120]   Basically, it's you do a good job, right?
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.940]   The evangelism will come,
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.180]   but the basic way is that you do an excellent job.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.140]   That's why you were hired.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.820]   I wasn't hired to evangelize.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.860]   I was hired to do a good job.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.860]   But then as we do a good job,
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.360]   as we show up and do the best we can,
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.660]   as we pray for the spirit of excellence,
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.460]   then we have a little credibility
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.380]   to talk and to share our story.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.700]   So I think that's the first thing
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.860]   that Daniel kind of pulls out.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.240]   And we can see that his distractors,
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.880]   his people who are working against him for whatever reason,
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.280]   they couldn't find any fault in his work
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.280]   because it was excellent work, right?
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.760]   Now I know I've lived in Hong Kong,
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.680]   Marian and I, since 2009.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.040]   So I know preaching to a congregation in Hong Kong
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.160]   about doing excellent work is like, yeah,
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.920]   I've been told that since the beginning, right?
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.920]   And this is not just about doing,
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.500]   you know, crushing your KPIs or whatever that, okay?
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.020]   This is not about doing that work,
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.340]   only the excellent work.
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.060]   It is that, it is showing up.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.740]   And this is one of the things we tell our students,
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.920]   show up, do the best you can do.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.900]   But there's something more going on here, right?
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.780]   And the something more that's going on
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.700]   is he's called to a spirit of excellence.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.700]   And this word excellence comes from the word,
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.900]   like when we see it later in 2 Peter,
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.540]   the word virtue, virtues build up our character, right?
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.700]   So you have the virtue of courage,
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.160]   you have the virtue of resilience,
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.620]   you have the virtue of kindness,
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.820]   and you can become those things.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.500]   Your character you can change.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.540]   Certain things you can't change,
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.700]   but your character can change.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.780]   Now what's interesting is when you go back
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.860]   to the original, like the Greek,
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.060]   in terms of what is the word for virtue,
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.420]   it's the word arete.
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.780]   And the word arete means excellence.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.740]   So what the writers are telling us is a couple of things.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.260]   Yes, Daniel was doing an excellent job
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.220]   in terms of the work, but it was how he was doing it.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.900]   Daniel is a leader of character.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.340]   And that's my challenge for us this morning,
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.260]   is that when we leave this place,
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.420]   that we have this sense of what would it look like
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.260]   for you to be a leader of character in your place of work?
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.100]   And you might be thinking,
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.020]   well, Steve, I'm not really a leader in my work,
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.620]   or that's gonna be challenging for a lot of reasons,
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.820]   but at the university we define Lead for Life
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.540]   in the program, we define it as influencing towards a goal.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.020]   Everyone's a leader,
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.540]   and you can all influence towards a goal.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.380]   But what would it look like to do that
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.060]   through your character?
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:05.980]   But it goes more.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.740]   It's not just excellent character,
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.220]   it's a spirit of excellence.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.260]   And this is where we see again and again in this passage
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.820]   that it's the faith of Daniel.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.040]   It's your faith.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.580]   It's the spirit of God in you.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.020]   And so as you pray and think about
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.100]   what would it look like for me,
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.300]   to be said of me that you had the spirit of excellence,
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.460]   for someone to say of you,
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.140]   you had the spirit of excellence.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.300]   And there's a spiritual side,
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.380]   there's a calling to it, right?
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.500]   But one thing it means is that your people at work
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.700]   need to know you're a Christian,
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.300]   if you are a Christian, right?
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.420]   They need to know you're a believer.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.860]   What we'll see in this passage
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.820]   is that everybody knows Daniel is a person of faith.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.820]   Our faith is personal, but it's also public.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.460]   And that's one part that Daniel shows us.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.100]   So we have this model of excellence,
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.780]   a spirit of excellence.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.700]   And what would that look like in your work?
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.740]   Is this making a little sense?
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.380]   Yeah, we're tracking?
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.980]   Yeah, okay.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.740]   Now, did you notice something we were reading?
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.260]   I know it was a long passage in the middle of a Sunday,
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.980]   but did you notice something that his distractors,
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.020]   one of my friends calls them misbehaviors.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.300]   The people, you know, you're good, you're just misbehaving.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.460]   So they're misbehaviors who were after Daniel.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:39.500]   They had to lie in order to catch Daniel and lay the trap.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.540]   Did you see that in verse seven?
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.700]   They're going to the king,
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.780]   and it says they talked before they went to the king.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.380]   You know, they were conspiring together,
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.580]   and they go before the king,
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.820]   and then they say basically,
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.460]   all of the officials agree, right?
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.300]   But the writer's already given us the org chart.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.900]   We know that Daniel was one of the high officials.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.400]   I don't think Daniel was consulted in this, right?
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.700]   Now, I don't know if it's encouraging to you or not,
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.860]   or discouraging to you that 2,500 years ago,
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.100]   there was already office politics, right?
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:17.900]   It says something about the human heart, right,
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.180]   of what we are.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.500]   But let me tell you something that I've found.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.660]   Sometimes when I find myself in a sin
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.940]   or something that I've done wrong,
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.740]   I've missed the mark or whatever,
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.860]   one of the things I recognize is that
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.660]   somewhere along the line, I bought a lie.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.620]   If something's not kind of going right,
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.900]   and you know it's not going right,
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.260]   there's injustice going on.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.020]   We don't know why these guys are against Daniel.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.460]   We don't know if it's because they're jealous.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.620]   We don't know because they're afraid.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.620]   We don't know if there's some racism.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.180]   We'll hear later they talk about he's in exile.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.840]   We don't know why,
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   but what I found is that when I'm in a situation,
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.340]   whether I'm doing or someone else is doing,
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.380]   there's a lie somewhere.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.940]   And so I ask to see the lie,
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.820]   and it makes sense if you think about it, right?
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.100]   Because the devil is the father of lies,
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.220]   and so the lie is going to come somewhere.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.880]   But on the other hand, Jesus is the way,
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.260]   the truth, and the life, and the truth sets us free.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.460]   So if you're in a situation, this is just an aside,
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.960]   one thing I do is I just pray,
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.640]   God, show me what lie I bought.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.700]   Maybe I bought a lie earlier that said I deserve more.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.400]   Maybe that was the lie.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.040]   But what lie did I buy, or that's in this situation,
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.220]   and then shine the truth
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.520]   so that we can move on and out of this.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.000]   Okay, so that's just an aside.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.220]   We're going to go on to the next section.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.520]   Is that clear?
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.560]   Yeah, everybody good?
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.280]   Okay, so you might want to turn to your neighbor,
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.920]   wake up your neighbor, say, second episode gets better.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.400]   We should have got popcorn,
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.440]   and we're going to go on to the next, okay?
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.760]   Okay, so let's go to the next section as we read,
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.480]   carry on with Daniel.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.600]   Verse 10 says this,
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.000]   "When Daniel knew that the document had been signed,"
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.080]   okay, so I just want to give you a little bit of a heads up
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.680]   what's going on in this section.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.920]   "No matter what's going on in your workplace,
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.260]   "no matter what's going on in your home,
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.480]   "no matter what struggle you're going through,
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.700]   "you always have the choice of how you respond."
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.520]   So what we're going to see is
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.800]   how did Daniel respond in this situation?
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.840]   "When Daniel knew that the document had been signed,
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.200]   "he went to his house where he had windows
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.680]   "in his upper chamber, open towards Jerusalem."
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.500]   You can kind of note that phrase.
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.920]   "Then he got down on his knees three times a day
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.700]   "and prayed and gave thanks before his God,
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.880]   "as he has done previously.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.740]   "And then these men came by agreement,
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.920]   "and they found Daniel making a petition and plea
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.360]   "before his God."
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.400]   He was praying.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.020]   "Then they came near and said before the king
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.360]   "concerning the injunction,
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.720]   "'O king, did you not sign an injunction
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.080]   "'that anyone who makes petition to any God or man
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.680]   "'within 30 days except to you, O king,
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.440]   "'should be cast into the den of lions?'
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.520]   "And the king answered and said,"
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.160]   he's quite proud of this law, he said,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.060]   "The thing stands fast.
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.720]   "According to the law of Medes and Persians,
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.120]   "which cannot be revoked.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.960]   "Then they," these distractors, these misbehaviors say,
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.140]   "Then they answered and said before the king,
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:34.140]   "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah,
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.980]   "pays no attention to you, O king,
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.860]   "or the injunction you have signed,
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.840]   "but makes his petition three times a day.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.320]   "Then the king, when he hears these words,
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.240]   "was much distressed."
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.140]   You can kind of imagine, right?
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.100]   The king is thinking, oh shoot, I forgot about Daniel.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:59.820]   And now he's distressed, and what does it do?
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.160]   And this is a beautiful line.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.580]   It says, "He labored until the sun went down to rescue him."
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.880]   In other words, what the king is doing
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.300]   is he's looking for every legal loophole
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.180]   to get Daniel out of trouble before sundown comes.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.960]   But sundown comes, and then the people come back.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.640]   And they, men by agreement, come to the king.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.500]   They say to the king, "Know, O king,
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.380]   "that it is the law of the Medes and Persians
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.140]   "that no injunction or ordinance
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.500]   "that the king establishes can be changed.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.440]   "And then the king commanded,
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.260]   "and Daniel was brought in, cast into the den of lions.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.520]   "The king declared to Daniel,
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.920]   "May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you."
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.840]   That's a beautiful line, right?
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.760]   This is the king, this is the boss talking.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.840]   And he knows Daniel's faith.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.920]   And he says to him, "May your God,
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.900]   "whom you continually serve, save you.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.620]   "And a stone was brought, laid on the mouth,
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.260]   "denned, king sealed it with his own signet,
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.440]   "signet of the Lord's,
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.240]   "that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.980]   "And then the king went to his palace
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.000]   "and spent the night fasting.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.740]   "No diversions were brought to him,
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.740]   "and sleep fled from him."
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.480]   I love the relationship between Daniel and the king.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.620]   You're gonna see more of it in the next session.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.280]   But basically, what we see here is,
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.020]   how did Daniel respond, right?
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.000]   What did he do?
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.460]   He knows he's been trapped.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:32.740]   He knows he's going to the lion's den.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.880]   Verse 10, what does he do?
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.980]   Do you remember some time ago,
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.460]   there was a campaign that was kind of resurrected,
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.320]   renewed from World War II Britain.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.100]   And it had t-shirts, and it had all types of signs.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.740]   It was the one that said, "Stay calm and carry on," right?
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.380]   You remember that?
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.020]   I mean, we had all types of kind of parodies
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.260]   of that going out.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.080]   But that's basically what Daniel does.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.940]   Daniel basically says, I mean,
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.600]   he stays calm and he carries on.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.100]   That might be something for us,
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.140]   in terms of our situations, whatever those might be.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.820]   So he does that, but what does that mean for him?
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.020]   And what that means for him is that he goes
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.620]   and he prays three times a day.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.620]   Why is he praying three times a day?
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.580]   Psalm 55 says, "I pray to you, Lord,
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.580]   "morning, noon, and night."
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.860]   He's living that out.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.500]   He's living the word out.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.740]   Why are the windows open?
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.640]   The writer goes to great attention to open windows.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.280]   Why are the windows open?
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.080]   Because hundreds of years earlier,
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.080]   when Solomon had built the temple and he consecrated,
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.520]   he prayed over the temple.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.880]   And he knew that one day,
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.120]   people wouldn't be able to come to the temple.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   And so he prayed for those who were out of the country,
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.640]   that they would pray towards the temple.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   And so what became a sign, a physical, tangible sign
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.520]   of a faithful exile, because again, Daniel's an exile.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.200]   He was taken forcefully into exile.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.340]   What became that sign is praying
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.420]   with open windows towards Jerusalem.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.800]   So here's my question.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.180]   What are your open windows towards Jerusalem?
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.080]   What are the tangible things that point you
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.780]   towards God in your workplace?
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.120]   Now, I'm gonna be honest with you.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.000]   I might've closed those windows for 30 days, right?
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.520]   But Daniel did it.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.740]   He had these open windows, you know,
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.000]   and it was so open that the distractors knew they could come
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.320]   and they could see him.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.600]   And they could, you know, this day,
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.640]   they'd probably take a picture.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.640]   They'd WhatsApp the king or whatever, but they can see him.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.040]   But Daniel was faithful to that.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.120]   What are your, in your workplace,
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.100]   what are some reminders for you
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.000]   that help you remember who and whose you are?
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.960]   Give you some examples.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.080]   If I have a friend who has a kind of alarm set every day
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.520]   to 3 p.m., he schedules his day around 3 p.m.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.560]   At 3 p.m., the alarm goes off and he prays.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.400]   That's his way of basically reminding himself
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.520]   that the work he's doing, the fruitfulness,
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.840]   is only gonna come from God, the lasting fruitfulness.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.340]   Another friend, he's an executive of a global company,
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.320]   automotive company in Switzerland, massive office.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.480]   He's got one of those offices with the big cadenza
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.760]   down the back and the big desk.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.160]   And on the cadenza at the back is basically a Bible
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.280]   open to Proverbs.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.360]   That's his way of saying, I want my decisions
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.240]   for this global company to be wise ones
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.960]   and to be the wisdom from above.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.660]   For me, I have things on my desk.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.880]   I have a little prayer book that helps remind me,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.660]   what could be yours or what are yours?
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.840]   And if they're not yours, what could you do right now
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.920]   or today, this week, to start putting those into practice?
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.320]   But I love what it says here.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.400]   It says in the prayer, he prayed
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.080]   because this was his habit, right?
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.720]   And it's praised three times a day.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.480]   And then it says, he prayed and gave thanks to God.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.720]   So I wanna think about that word thanks with you
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   for a moment because whatever situation you are in,
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.940]   there is something to be thankful for.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.240]   Last couple of years, it's been a really tough one
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.120]   in our family for a number of different ways
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.240]   for both Marian and I and our extended families.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.720]   My mom died during the time of COVID, not of COVID,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.880]   but she died during that time.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.540]   My dad passed away last year, about this time,
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.540]   almost exactly last year.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.880]   Dad really took a turn for the worse
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.760]   and I left the work program and went to be back
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.800]   with him in Austin and with my brothers.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.640]   He was in the hospital when we were there
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.080]   and my brothers and I took time sleeping
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.200]   and exchanging off during the shifts,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.720]   sleeping there in the hospital room.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.120]   And I was there probably about eight, 10 days,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.520]   something like that, but most of the time that I was there,
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.640]   dad was either sleeping or he was not coherent
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.460]   when he was coming to.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.740]   Now, dad was 96, man of God, a Daniel in his own right,
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.640]   a scientist that had done amazing work in his life.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.400]   And I was just there and I was praying to God,
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.640]   God, give me some time, some moment,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.920]   that when he's coherent, that I can be here with him.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.400]   And sure enough, the night before I was scheduled
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.040]   to come back to Hong Kong on like a Tuesday,
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.960]   on that Monday night, it was kind of my shift.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.480]   My brother had gone down to get some supper downstairs
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.040]   and then he joined us afterwards.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.040]   But during that time, dad woke up and he was coherent.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:01.000]   And so he kind of came to and then he's like, where am I?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.940]   And I said the name of the hospital and he said, oh no.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.960]   'Cause he'd been in that hospital before,
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.420]   he didn't like that hospital.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:16.420]   So, and then he said, is it bad?
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.900]   And I said, yes, it is.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.160]   And then he said, it's a very direct question
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.360]   as a scientist, he said, am I going to die?
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.400]   And I said, well, we thought we'd lost you over the weekend.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.800]   And then he kind of paused.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.520]   And you can imagine, I mean, tubes coming all out of him,
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.240]   hooked up to all these machines,
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.360]   machines all over the place.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.100]   And he kind of looks at me and he says,
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.840]   there's a lot to be thankful for.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.000]   So, that is a leader of character.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.560]   That is Daniel, that is what Daniel is doing.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.680]   Daniel's going in the midst of this and saying,
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.560]   there's a lot to be thankful for.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.280]   And I know that's tough, right?
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.160]   I know that's tough to find things to be thankful for.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.360]   Earlier in this year, I had some surgery on my face,
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.680]   I had something need to be taken off my nose.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.160]   And so I had this big surgery,
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.520]   they had to put something on my face,
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.520]   which kind of looked like a big one of those egg sushis
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.160]   or something like that, stepped in.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.280]   It was unbelievable, right?
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.200]   And so I'm thinking, how can I be thankful for this, right?
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.120]   Because I'm speaking, I'm doing these other things.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.200]   But then I was thinking, I can be thankful for this
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.640]   'cause well, Mary and my wife, she still looked at me
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.280]   and I was okay with that.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.600]   And she was there going through it with me.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.600]   And maybe that's what we can be thankful for
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.800]   is that you've got someone to go through this with you.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.660]   And if you don't, reach out, we'll go through with you.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.680]   And that, there's always something to be thankful for.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.640]   In fact, there's a lot to be thankful for.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.040]   One of my nephews made a plaque
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.600]   and sent it out to all dad's grandkids and great-grandkids
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.000]   and extended family with there's a lot to be thankful for.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.800]   I wanna go on now and finish up the passage.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.200]   But before I do, I don't want us to miss something
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.360]   that's very important here.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:15.520]   And that is that Daniel had habits, right?
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.240]   He had habits that were good habits.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.800]   And good habits will hold you in bad times.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.360]   Good habits will hold you in bad times,
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.380]   but you can't wait till the lion den come
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.360]   to start those habits.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.440]   Says here that Daniel went and looked previously,
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.080]   he did what he did previously, it was already a habit.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.680]   Now research today shows he had the two best habits
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.440]   in the world in terms of gratitude,
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.520]   what that does for you in terms of strengthening you
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.200]   and also prayer.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.600]   And let me just reinforce that,
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.000]   that habit of daily consistent prayer,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.920]   if you don't have it, put it into place.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.600]   As a pastor in a local churches for many, many years,
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.200]   you know, sometimes couples would come to me
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.720]   and they would be in a bad situation in their life.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.160]   And between the two of them, the relationship
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.360]   was not strong.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.480]   And one of the times when I would talk to them,
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.840]   when I, at some point when I would talk to them,
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.320]   I would ask them, are you still able to pray?
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:23.400]   Because I know how tough it is to pray during those times.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.240]   And Mary and I have been married 41 years.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   And along the way, we've learned this habit of praying,
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.600]   just little prayers.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.000]   So it's basically before we go to bed at night,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.560]   we'll just say a little prayer for each other.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.680]   And, you know, if I pray too long,
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.280]   Marian falls asleep, you know?
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.760]   So the secret is keep it short, you know?
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.240]   But that's the habit that will hold you
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.000]   when the times are bad.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Don't wait, start today.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.400]   Whatever those habits are, put them into place
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.480]   because when something comes, that will help hold you.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.320]   Amen?
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.160]   - Amen.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.920]   - Okay, still okay, still good?
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.440]   Need to wake up the other neighbor on the other side?
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.240]   Yeah, okay, tell that person it gets better,
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.840]   the lions are coming,
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.640]   and Steve might share something personal encounter.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.280]   Okay, so let's go through the last part here
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.640]   as we look up and finish up.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.320]   Okay, so,
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:28.880]   then at the break of day, the king rose
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.920]   and went in haste to the den of lions.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.000]   And as he came near to the den where Daniel was,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.280]   he cried out in a tone of anguish.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.960]   The king declared to Daniel,
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.880]   oh, Daniel, servant of the living God,
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.040]   has your God whom you serve continually
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.560]   been able to deliver you from the lions?
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.640]   I just love that, you know?
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.960]   The king doesn't even want to see
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.600]   'cause he's afraid of what he's gonna see,
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.520]   so he cries from a distance.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.440]   And then Daniel calls back and he says,
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.840]   then Daniel said to the king,
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.120]   oh, king, live forever.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.360]   My God sent his angel and shut the lion's mouth,
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.320]   and they have not harmed me
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.720]   because I was found blameless before him
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.320]   and also before you.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.920]   Oh, king, I have done no harm.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.240]   And then the king was exceedingly glad.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.000]   You know, I love this relationship between the two.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.120]   I just believe that Daniel was praying
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.160]   some of those times for his boss.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.480]   He was praying for his boss.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.200]   Do you pray for your boss?
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.920]   Do you pray good things for your boss?
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.280]   Okay, keep praying those good things.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.320]   It works, right?
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.240]   We see this relationship here.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.680]   The king was exceedingly glad
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.600]   and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.080]   And so Daniel was taken up out of the den
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.160]   and no kind of harm was found on him.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.600]   Mark this however you can mark it in your heart
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.720]   with a pen, because he had trusted in his God.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.160]   And the king commanded,
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.600]   and those men who had,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.440]   and the king commanded,
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.040]   and those men who had maliciously,
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.880]   these are the mistake, misbehaviors,
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.440]   accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.520]   They, their children, and their wives.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.400]   This is where the rating of the docuseries goes way up.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.560]   And before they reached the bottom of the den,
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.880]   the lions overpowered them
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.720]   and broke all their bones in pieces.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.440]   Okay, this is kind of hard, right?
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.120]   But I think what the,
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.000]   what the writer is telling us is,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.120]   it's not because the lions weren't hungry.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.860]   They didn't eat Daniel.
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.360]   There's something else.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.960]   And he wants to make that clear.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.760]   And then the king Darius wrote to all the people,
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.200]   nations and languages,
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   and receive this as a blessing given to you.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.960]   Peace be multiplied to you.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.880]   I make a decree that in all my royal dominion,
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.680]   people are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel,
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.760]   for he is a living God, enduring forever.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.720]   His kingdom shall never be destroyed,
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.320]   and his dominion shall be to the end.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.800]   He delivers and rescues.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.280]   He works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.460]   He who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions.
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.500]   And you might put your name in there.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.120]   He who has saved you from whatever power
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.640]   that you're working against.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.460]   So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.360]   and the reign of Cyprus, the Persian.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.400]   Okay, I need to wrap up here.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.020]   But I want to say a few things as we close,
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.560]   which are really important.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:38.060]   And the first thing is,
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.700]   is if we leave this place today,
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:46.140]   and we think, okay, Steve, got it.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.160]   I'm going to go home.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.740]   I'm going to open my windows.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.340]   I'm going to start praying three times a day,
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.400]   and it's all going to work out well.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.180]   Then we've missed the point.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:01.820]   The point is what we marked earlier,
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.760]   because Daniel had trusted God.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:12.980]   I pray and hope that whatever you're going through
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.100]   will have this amazingly,
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.580]   beyond expectations and Ephesians.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.660]   We talk about more than we can imagine.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.340]   This powerful ending is beautiful.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.300]   It's a display of God's splendor going out.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.980]   But that's the result.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.340]   And the result we leave to God.
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.980]   And this is where Daniel's friends,
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.620]   remember Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.860]   who were also teenagers,
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:41.380]   and if you're young here today, step into this, okay?
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.700]   Because Daniel used his whole life
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.980]   to display the splendor of God.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.500]   And if you're older, like myself,
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.740]   there's still time, I'm not 80 yet, right?
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:51.980]   And we can work with it.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.060]   But what we see here is that
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.860]   the trust of his friends.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.380]   I want to read a passage from chapter three.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.220]   This is Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:09.220]   Earlier, the king has laid up a big image of gold and said,
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.100]   either you worship this image
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.380]   or I'm going to put you in the fiery furnace.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.500]   And this is their response.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:20.500]   If we, the three said, are thrown into a blazing furnace,
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.860]   the God we serve is able to save us from it.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.880]   And he will rescue us from your hand, O king.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:32.700]   But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king,
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.020]   that we will not serve your gods
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.460]   or worship the image of gold you have set up.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.420]   That's a leader of character.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.980]   That's someone who gets it,
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.940]   that what we do is we do the right thing.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.000]   And what we do is we trust the results to God,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.840]   because that's a much bigger story than we have, amen?
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:59.140]   So this word trust is one I want to leave you with.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:02.100]   And it's one as beginning of a new year,
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.880]   often our family will choose a word
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.060]   for that year to focus on.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.860]   It was New York a couple of years ago,
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.700]   and I chose the word trust.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.260]   Usually my words last till about February,
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.980]   but I'm still writing down trust
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.980]   at the top of my prayer journal every day.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.260]   Because trust is what,
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.500]   this is really what it's about.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.140]   It's about trusting Jesus.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.640]   I want to come to that last slide on trusting Jesus,
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.740]   because Dallas Willard basically said,
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:40.820]   "We can sum up the whole of the gospel in two words,
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.580]   "and it's these two words."
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.600]   It's just in trust in Jesus is where we're at.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:51.020]   'Cause it's a personal thing, and I love that.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.900]   You know, the word pist is faith.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.540]   It basically just means trust.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.380]   And because I trust Jesus and you trust Jesus,
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.020]   we can have a relationship of trust ourselves.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.540]   It doesn't matter if you believe differently
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.320]   in a doctrine than I do.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.620]   It's this trusting Jesus.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:09.280]   It's a personal and a public thing.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.260]   So let me finish just with a little personal story.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:18.260]   It's an encounter of high time I first met Jesus.
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.020]   It was in Zaria, Nigeria,
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.420]   a little town in northern Nigeria.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:28.300]   I was 17 years old, not a believer.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.780]   The story actually starts about two weeks earlier.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.820]   This was on, two weeks earlier we'd been to a conference.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.700]   It was a big conference room like this.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.860]   I was sitting way in the back, causing kind of trouble.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.380]   My mom was down here.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.060]   There was a speaker up here.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.420]   The speaker began to speak.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:46.940]   There was something in what he said.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.900]   The Holy Spirit empowered him,
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.580]   and I just felt that on myself.
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.240]   I felt the presence of love, and I felt myself listening,
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.140]   and I felt myself changing, and then it was over.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.020]   I don't know what he said.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.820]   I don't even know the speaker.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.220]   Went out that night, 17 year old, non-believer,
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.900]   still got in trouble, and had some fun.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.660]   Came in late that night, and then my mom was still up.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.420]   My mom was sitting up here at the conference.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.540]   I was back there.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.060]   Mom, when I walked in, she said,
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:18.220]   "Something happened to you tonight, didn't it?"
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.860]   And I said, "Yes, it did."
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.380]   And she said, "Do you know what it was?"
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.060]   And I said, "No."
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.620]   And she said, "Okay."
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.540]   And then we went to bed,
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.300]   because mom had all the wisdom to know
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.940]   to give God space to work.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:38.460]   And two weeks later, God worked.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.180]   I felt the same presence in the room.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.420]   I got up, and I just felt God's there, and I said, "Yes."
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.020]   And from then 'til now, trying the best I can,
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.160]   and we're all works in progress, to trust God daily.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.820]   Thomas Merton says, "One thing I know,
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.460]   "if you're there when the Spirit dances, dance."
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.860]   So if you feel God speaking to you in any way
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.460]   about wanting that living relationship or something at work,
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.800]   dance, say yes.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:10.420]   What would it look like for you to trust God more?
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.620]   What would it look like for you
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.780]   to trust your whole life completely to God,
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.780]   if you've not done that?
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.260]   Let's close in prayer.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:23.260]   And I'm gonna invite us just to have a moment
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:28.660]   of just prayer between you and God.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.220]   I don't need to lead this.
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.940]   But maybe you wanna start with Daniel
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.420]   and just say a word of thanks.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.060]   Thank you, God, that I'm here.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.300]   Thank you, God, that...
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:45.220]   And then...
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:54.980]   Begin to talk with him about what it would look like
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.880]   for a spirit of excellence for you.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.880]   What would it look like to develop good habits today?
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:11.480]   What would it look like to trust Him more?
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.900]   (gentle music)
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.480]   (gentle music)
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.060]   (gentle music)
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.640]   (gentle music)
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.220]   (gentle music)
