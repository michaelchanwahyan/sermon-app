[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:25.120]   Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.320]   Leave behind your regrets and mistakes.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.480]   Come today, there's no reason to wait.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.600]   Jesus is calling.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.320]   Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.800]   From the ashes a new life is born.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.120]   Jesus is calling.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:02.720]   O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:12.320]   Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.840]   O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:33.520]   Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:52.640]   Oh what a Savior, oh what a Savior.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.360]   Isn't he wonderful?
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:06.960]   Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:16.400]   Bow down before him, for he is Lord of all.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.040]   Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.760]   Thank you Lord.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.120]   Oh what a Savior, isn't he wonderful?
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:44.160]   Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:53.680]   Bow down before him, for he is Lord of all.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.880]   Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:14.000]   O come, O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.440]   Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:32.720]   O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:42.160]   Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.760]   O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:02.640]   Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.560]   Bear your cross as you wait for the crown.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.480]   Tell the world of the treasure you found.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   [MUSIC]
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   [MUSIC]
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.800]   Who makes the sun to rise?
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.560]   Who makes the sun to rise and brings the earth new life?
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:19.040]   In every beam, Jesus it is you.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:26.960]   Who turns the day to night and watches me as I begin to dream?
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.960]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.840]   Who brings me food for my table?
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.560]   Who cares for all of my needs?
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   Who walks the road with me, has grown with me through all that I have been?
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.600]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.760]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:11.440]   Oh, so I lift my hands.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:18.160]   I bring my song.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:31.200]   All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:45.440]   I offer my life here and beyond.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:57.280]   To the one thing true, Jesus, it is you.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:07.280]   [MUSIC]
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.840]   Who sees my brokenness?
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:17.760]   Who sees my brokenness and carries me when I am frail and weak?
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.680]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:31.440]   Who tells the storm to rest when I am overwhelmed and cannot speak?
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.200]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.760]   Who wears my guilt on his shoulders?
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.480]   Who holds my heart in his hands?
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:58.000]   Who takes my thoughts and fears and hangs them on the arms of cavalry?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.280]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.360]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:14.960]   Oh, so I lift my hands.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.600]   I bring my song.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:34.400]   All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:48.560]   I offer my life here and beyond.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:57.520]   To the one thing true, Jesus, it is you.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.320]   We lift our voice.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:07.120]   So I lift my hands.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:13.760]   I bring my song.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:26.240]   All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   I offer my life here and beyond.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:51.440]   To the one thing true, Jesus, it is you.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:10:06.320]   To the one thing true, Jesus, it is you.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   To the one thing true, Jesus, it is you.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:30.960]   Before Jesus went to the cross, which is something we remembered, we also celebrated
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.480]   his resurrection last week, but before he did that, he set up a meal.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:44.720]   A meal, it's something that can draw people around the table like this one here.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:51.040]   So what we do here once a month, the communion, it's not meant to be individual.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.400]   It's meant to be something that we do in a community.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.720]   It meant to, we're meant to do this with someone together.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.000]   We're drawn to a table together to share a meal together.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.320]   So yes, the meal here, the bread and the wine, it represents Jesus' body and his blood.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:18.920]   It's still, we're still pointing towards God, towards Jesus, but we're meant to come together.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:26.440]   And so as a welcome team, they're distributing the bread and the cups right now.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.480]   I want you to do this.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.640]   If you've received your bread and your cup, why don't you turn around to the ones around
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.960]   you and just say, "Hey, how can I pray for you this week?
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.080]   How, what are you going through?"
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.680]   You can be short, you don't have to tell, you know, we're not taking like forever, but
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.400]   just quickly like, "Hey, how can I pray for you?"
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.720]   Or even if you haven't received the bread right now, right where you are, why don't
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.640]   you just turn to the person next to you and ask, "How can I pray for you this week?
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:02.040]   How can I, when we come to Jesus together, how can I talk to Jesus about you this week?
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.600]   What's your need?
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.360]   How can I support you as your church family?
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:13.360]   How can I come alongside you?"
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   Amen.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:27.360]   Amen.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   Amen.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   Amen.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:48.360]   Amen.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   Amen.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:05.000]   And together as a community, together as a family, we gather around a table and together
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.360]   we partake in this communion.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.720]   So if you've bread in your hand, I invite you church, let's partake in the bread.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:27.240]   Let's take it together right now.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.080]   If you're praying for each other, I do want to give you time to finish that.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.520]   I can quickly wrap up.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.520]   It's beautiful.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.880]   We're meant to do this together, church.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.040]   I'm so proud of you.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:46.240]   I'm so proud of our community.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.960]   And whatever their needs are, we know that we have the answer in Jesus.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.320]   So Jesus says, "This is my blood.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.000]   I've make a new covenant with you."
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:11.520]   And so together church, let's take the cup.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.840]   Let me pray for us.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:20.560]   Jesus together as one family, we come before you that we know we don't do this alone.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.520]   We don't take this communion alone, but we do it with the people around us.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.160]   And so God, I'm here.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   Yes.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   We're here to focus.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.840]   We're here to worship you.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.880]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.120]   It's all about you, but it's also about those around us.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:43.920]   God, so the needs of those around me, it concerns me today, Lord.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.400]   We bring these needs towards you, to you as one family today.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.840]   We pray for each other.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.720]   God, may your will be done.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.420]   May your kingdom come.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.080]   But I also pray that you would bless those who are around us right in this room.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.560]   Help us so that we would learn to be a family together.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:12.560]   In Jesus name I pray.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:19.880]   Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:26.200]   Jesus in the darkness over every enemy.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:38.520]   Jesus for my family, I speak the holy name, Jesus.

[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.400]   Your name is healing.

[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:54.240]   Make every stronghold shine through the shadows, burn like a fire.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:07.400]   I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind.

[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:23.080]   Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets.

[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.400]   So God, we're here to worship you as your church.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.960]   We're here to believe.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:41.160]   We're not to believe the darkness that we see around, but we are to believe the light
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.000]   that we find in you.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.960]   And we believe that you want to bring this light to this city, especially you want to
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.640]   do it through us, your followers, your people.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.960]   And so God, I praise you, Lord.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.040]   We worship you, Lord.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:02.680]   We were here to intercede, to pray for our city, to pray for our households.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.960]   We're here to pray for those around us, just like what we did minutes ago.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:14.000]   Father, we pray that today through how we pray, how we intercede, we want to minister
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.200]   your light, your presence into those around us.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.720]   Father, we pray that we'll continue to focus on you.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:27.440]   We'll continue to fix our eyes on you so that we don't forget, yes, there is darkness outside.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:33.880]   There are challenges everywhere, but you are here and you're here to bring light and life
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.000]   to this world.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.720]   And so Jesus, we thank you.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.020]   I thank you for your love.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.320]   Thank you for your presence in this place here today.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:47.900]   Thank you for dying for us and also for rising from the dead for us as well so that we could
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:54.880]   experience that resurrection power, that we could be the resurrection people on this planet.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.880]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.600]   We praise you.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.600]   We worship you.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   And in Jesus name we pray.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   Amen.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.600]   Amen.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.000]   Let's give a shout to Jesus.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.160]   Amen.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.880]   Thank you worship team.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.200]   Love you guys.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:23.760]   Please be seated everyone.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.800]   How are you all doing?
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.480]   I could feel that excitement from our kids.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.800]   Oh, that's so good.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.760]   Just want to say hello to everyone.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.820]   My name is Chapman.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.880]   I am one of the pastors here.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.720]   Welcome to Divine Yuen Long.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.040]   Hopefully if this is your first time visiting, you want to get to know us a little bit or
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.000]   maybe your friends told you about us, you're here to just check it out and see.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.760]   We just want to extend a very warm welcome to you.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.120]   And if you're here for the very first time, could you let us know where we are?
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.320]   We just want to say hi to you.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.320]   Hi.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.720]   Thank you for coming.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   Yes.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.680]   Thank you so much.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.440]   If you want to get to know more about us or if you haven't done so in the last couple
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.840]   of weeks, we have a new WhatsApp channel.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.940]   We are replacing the old with the new one.
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.920]   If you haven't been with us for the last couple of weeks, haven't scanned that yet, you have
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.880]   three more seconds to do this.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.880]   Or if they put it there, you can continue to scan.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.520]   But right now we're going to pray for our children.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   Can you sense the excitement?
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.520]   Oh, great.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.200]   They're going to experience Jesus today.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.200]   All right.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.800]   So why don't we stretch our hands to what's the kids we're going to pray for them.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:40.240]   Father, we just pray that you will meet all our children today in the K through C classroom.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   You speak to them.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.160]   Your love, God, I just pray it will fall tangibly on them.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.400]   Lord, I just pray they would learn about you, learn about your word, and that they will
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.040]   experience your presence even in those rooms.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.040]   In Jesus' name I pray.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.040]   Amen.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.360]   Yes, they are too excited.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.640]   So let's bring them to K through C right now.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.680]   Teacher June is over there.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.440]   So kids, you can go to June over there.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.760]   She's waiting for you.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.600]   And if you have kids under the age of two, we have a playroom at the back.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.120]   You can be with your kid inside and there's a TV.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.360]   We're streaming the service live inside.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.640]   All right.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:27.040]   So you have, I assume you guys talk a little bit about like how you can pray for each other
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.040]   just now.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.780]   I'll give you another two minutes.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.820]   Why don't we just briefly share a little bit about a week, what you've done over holiday,
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.960]   just you know, chit chat a little bit, get to know each other.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.960]   I'll be back in a minute.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   Living in the present, not what it should have occurred.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   I remember back when I was low as a rug.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   Now I'm standing up, look at what my father does.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.960]   Turning all things blue, gray skies blue.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   Hear the church say, "And won't he do it?"
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.960]   I know he's got my back.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   That's why I'm singing that.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   I know he's got my back.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   That's why I'm singing that.

[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.440]   And then we have another announcement.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.200]   If you have any young people around you in your family, young meaning, like I know you
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.000]   look at me, you think I'm young.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.600]   Anyway, you have any teenagers at home or around you, you know, we have a good news
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.600]   to bring to you.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:09.360]   A couple of weeks ago at our vision Sunday, you've heard Pastor Tim talked about our heart
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.180]   to start a youth ministry, start a youth group here.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.080]   And we're taking the next step right now.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.420]   So can we have the slides behind me?
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:23.440]   If you are interested, like, I mean, as families, if you have teenagers at home, or if you're
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:30.280]   a teacher or you work with young people, said, I want to bring them to Jesus, you could,
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.280]   this is happening.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.440]   I mean, happening by happening.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.480]   I mean, we're preparing for that to start.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:42.000]   So if you're interested, you want to know more information today after the service and
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.120]   next week after the service, you can come to me right after the service.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.760]   We'll have a chat over that corner.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:53.040]   So if you have kids, you know anyone who have kids, come have a chat with me.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:29:00.120]   I would love to learn more about your teenagers at home or the teenagers that around you.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   All right.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.600]   So come to me if you have any teenagers around you.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:09.400]   Or if you said, hey, Chapman, if there's a youth ministry, there's a youth group, I would
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.400]   love to serve.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.160]   I would love to be a youth leader.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.920]   I know there's someone right here.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   You're thinking about that.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.200]   So you need to scan this QR code also.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:24.600]   So this is for if you're interested in volunteering, we're going to have a youth group volunteer
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.960]   info session in two weeks time, April 21st.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.200]   I will do it after lunch, 2.30 to 3.30.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   So interested.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.200]   I need to see more cameras right now.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   I'm just joking.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   But yeah.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   All right.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.420]   But if you know someone, they will be great, you know, with teenagers, you can encourage
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:45.840]   them to sign up or just encourage them to not to sign up to serve right away, but sign
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.440]   up, come here to learn more about it.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.280]   Is that okay?
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.200]   And even if you're not scanning any QR code, can I still invite you to stretch out your
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.040]   hands and, you know, pray, pray for the next generation.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.800]   We need more people to pray for our next generation.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   Amen.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   Amen.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   We're here.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   We're standing here for them.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   All right.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   One last thing.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.760]   Who likes coffee here?
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.600]   All right.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.080]   That's less than I expected.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.040]   That's great because we can get all the coffee.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   Not anyway.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.600]   No, we love you.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.040]   We do have a new coffee machine.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.280]   Someone very kindly donated a new coffee machine to us.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.920]   Is that exciting?
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.920]   Yes.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.400]   And we want to make good use of it.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.960]   We want to steward this resources that God has so graciously given us.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.840]   So we do have a coffee team right now.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.920]   They're serving.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.460]   So they will serve before service.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:40.640]   If you come to the English service, they will be serving, you know, before the service until
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.040]   1125.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.240]   So five minutes before service, we're just going to stop.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.080]   But after service, we'll be serving coffee again.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.200]   So if you like coffee, you know where to go.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.600]   Do say thank you to the coffee team.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.600]   They're serving.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.100]   They're great.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.080]   And there's a suggested donation as well.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.320]   There's a cost.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.920]   Every cup of coffee, we're suggesting if you could donate $30, that would help us continue
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.200]   to run, to serve, and to bring coffee to more people.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.960]   So that's it.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.600]   Did I miss anything about the coffee?
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   No.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   All right.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:21.360]   And now talking about like this donation, talking about, you know, how God is providing,
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:27.760]   we do also want to talk about a way that we can continue to worship, which is through
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.800]   our tithes and offering.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.880]   We can welcome team.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.080]   Feel free to pass out the buckets right now.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:41.400]   If you prefer to give by cash or checks or whatever, like the paper way, we have our
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.880]   buckets passing around right now.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.960]   Or if you are the digital generation, you use your phone for every single thing, all
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.280]   the QR codes are there behind me.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:32:01.000]   I love the fact that God, you know, moved someone and he donated a coffee machine to
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   us.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   I think that's awesome.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.960]   So this is a beautiful picture of offering.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.240]   And as a church, we have to learn how to steward these resources.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.160]   And the same, it's true of what we're doing here right now.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.200]   We thank you for your generosity.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.600]   I believe God is speaking to you how he wants you to give.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:24.440]   At the same time, we also have a role, how we're going to steward all these resources.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.680]   You can do it by joining in a ministry.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.700]   You can do it by serving alongside us.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.080]   You can do it by continuing to faithfully give.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:39.240]   You can do it by finding out more how you can, you know, steward all these resources
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.160]   by, you know, scanning that QR code and coming to Youth Ministry.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.640]   Okay, anyway, I'm going to stop here.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.680]   Let's pray.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:52.200]   Father, we celebrate the fact that you are a generous God.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.760]   We thank you for the generosity that we experience in our lives.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:02.320]   And we thank you for the opportunity when you allow us to be generous so that we could
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.060]   experience your heart even more.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.640]   So God, we just pray for the offering today.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.280]   We pray that these resources will be put in great use.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:16.680]   We pray that these resources will bless those around us in this community, in this city.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.360]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.360]   Amen.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.480]   All right, right now I'm going to invite a speaker today up here, Pastor Tim.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:29.000]   Can we put our hands together for Pastor Tim?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.640]   So great to have him back, right?
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.280]   If you didn't notice, he was gone for a while for holiday.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.520]   So you know, see, he's so fresh.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.520]   He looks fresh.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   Look at me.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.800]   No, I'm okay as well.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.760]   But let's stretch out our hands and pray for Pastor Tim.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.960]   Father, we thank you for Tim, for his heart.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:55.800]   He's such a pastor that he cares for people, that he loves to speak into our lives.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.920]   And God, I know this is what he has prepared to do today.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.640]   He is here to speak right into our hearts.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.480]   He is here to bring your word.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.600]   So God, we receive your servant.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.240]   We also receive the word that he's going to bring to us.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:13.800]   We open our hearts to you and to him who's going to bring us the word.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.200]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.200]   Amen.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   Amen.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   Thank you, Chapman.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.560]   He always looks fresh.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:28.720]   Hey, today we're starting a new sermon series and we've titled the sermon series, Longing
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.720]   for Healing.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:33.800]   Now, I don't know if you've ever longed for healing.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.440]   I certainly have.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.040]   So I think this is going to be very significant for us.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.880]   And so what we're going to do is we're going to look at Jesus and how it is in Jesus that
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:50.800]   we can find help, hope, healing, and wholeness.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.760]   Now what's interesting is when we look at the gospel and the encounters of Jesus with
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:03.440]   people, a lot of times people bring the obvious thing, the obvious need for healing to Jesus.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.120]   Maybe it's the physical healing.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.360]   Maybe it's the demon that needs to be driven out.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.040]   And in Jesus, you know, he heals.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.480]   He loves doing that.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.880]   But it doesn't just stop there.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:21.320]   If we pay close attention, we can see that Jesus many times does a more holistic and
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.280]   a deeper healing in that person's life.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.000]   A lot of times there's emotional healing.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.840]   There's social healing, bringing people back into community that were in isolation.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.400]   And so what we're going to do in this sermon series, we're going to look at these different
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.800]   ways that Jesus brings this healing to us.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.240]   And we're going to look at what that means for us personally and how we can experience
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.200]   Jesus bring healing into our lives.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:59.480]   Now I want to share with you the little bit of overview of where we're going to head.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.920]   So we have seven weeks planned.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.080]   I'm not going to talk through every title today.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.280]   Our topic is "No Other Name."
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.160]   And so we're going to look at that in a little bit.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.560]   But my heart for the sermon series is that we see that Jesus is healing.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:21.960]   It's not just back then, but that Jesus wants to release and bring a ceiling to us here
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   now.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.600]   You know, he has the power to step in the areas where there's brokenness, where there's
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:36.000]   pain, where there's suffering, and to meet us in that, to provide the grace that we need,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:44.160]   to maybe move forward, to provide the strength, to provide healing.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.560]   So Jesus meets us in different ways, but he does meet us.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.800]   And so that's what we're going to be doing in the sermon series.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:57.480]   Now some of us here might be sitting here and you're like, "Well, Tim, that is great.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.360]   But I'm actually feeling good.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.240]   I'm actually feeling fantastic."
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.840]   Well, that's awesome.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.440]   Praise God.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.240]   And I genuinely mean that.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:15.240]   Praise God that you are feeling awesome, that there's nothing obvious right now in your
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:24.040]   life that needs Jesus to meet you, to bring healing, and to touch your life.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.760]   But I do want to challenge you with this.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:35.600]   You know, as Christians, part of our discipleship journey is an ongoing healing journey.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.320]   It's actually for every Christian.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.280]   And the Bible talks about salvation in three different ways.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:51.400]   I was saved, I am being saved, and I will be saved.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:57.080]   So there's a past, a present, and a future way that scripture talks about this.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:04.640]   So that means that even if we are Christians, we are still in the process of being made
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.960]   whole.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.360]   Jesus is still at work in us.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.200]   He's not finished with us.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.040]   There's still things to be done.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:17.280]   There's still areas where we need healing in our lives, where we need restoration, where
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:24.180]   we need wholeness, where we need to be well.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:33.680]   And so I want to challenge you to be open to this holistic healing work of Jesus.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:40.520]   And I want to encourage you to actually pray a prayer, to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:48.560]   to you where He wants to do some healing and restoring work in your life.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.520]   Maybe it's in your character.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.960]   Maybe it's part of your history.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.680]   Maybe there's a breakup that has just been painful and you're just hung up on and you're
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.080]   not able to move forward.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.520]   Whatever it may be, but I want to encourage you to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to you
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.620]   where He wants to do some healing work in your life.
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:12.360]   And whatever the Holy Spirit surfaces, it's always good.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.320]   It's His timing.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:20.840]   And we can, even though maybe it's not always easy when we go through a healing process,
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:29.280]   but He's gentle with us and He will lead us through to a better place to bring wholeness
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   into our lives.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:36.320]   So I actually want to encourage us right now to take just 30 seconds or a minute, just
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.240]   pray this prayer as we set off on this sermon series.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.360]   So let's do that right now.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.360]   Just you on your own.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:40:13.160]   Yes, Holy Spirit, we, you know, every one of our lives, you know everything about us.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:20.200]   The things that are well and that are awesome and that are good, but also where we're carrying
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:26.480]   shame and carrying brokenness and, or just hurt from the past that we can't even name.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:33.840]   And Lord, we thank you that you are a healer, that you are rescued, that you are a savior.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:39.960]   And we ask that in this time, as you heard the prayers, as we just open our hearts and
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:46.880]   our lives to you, that you do your beautiful and healing work in us as a community.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.200]   Now also thank you that you've given us each other to journey with each other in this,
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.280]   that we're not alone in that.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.280]   I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.840]   Amen.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:05.400]   Now today our message is no other name.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.480]   End of 2023, I was feeling pain that was keeping me up at night.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.560]   So I'm laying in bed.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.560]   I can't sleep.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.360]   I don't, I don't know if you've had this where you shift around and it doesn't matter how
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.680]   you lay, you're still not feeling good.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.120]   So after a few nights like that, I was like, I think I need to go to the doctor.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.360]   So I go to the GP, he asked me diagnostic questions.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:32.320]   And then he concludes, he tells me, well, I believe you have something that is quite
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.080]   common among older men.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:40.760]   I was like, thank you for letting me know that I'm getting older.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.000]   So he ended up giving me antibiotics.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.480]   I take them, I feel better.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.120]   I think everything's okay.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:51.120]   A month later, this pain comes back again, but this time a little bit worse.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.360]   So I go to the specialist, they do CT scan, blood work.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.640]   Again I get antibiotics, which seems to be the solution for everything.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.040]   And I've started feeling better.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.480]   But this time, literally just for a week, and then I take a turn for the worse.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:14.600]   I'm in pain sitting, I'm in pain standing, I'm in pain laying.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.480]   Doesn't matter, basically doesn't matter what I do, I'm in pain and not feeling good.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:26.720]   Now a friend of mine who is knowledgeable about what the diagnosis was, so he encouraged
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   me to walk.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.120]   He's like, maybe if you walk, it will feel better.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.600]   It's like walking, really?
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.000]   Is that really going to help?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.960]   I was skeptical, I was like, yeah, I'll give it a try.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.760]   So I go out for a walk.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.920]   Now, one thing you might not know is I actually like walking.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:46.540]   So a lot of times I go for an hour walk trying to be healthy or healthier, I should say.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:50.200]   So I started walking, I mean, I can hardly walk.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:55.540]   And after a few hundred meters, I was like, something is wrong, something's not right.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.160]   So I go home to my wife, Chris.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.880]   I tell her I need to go to the A&E room.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:08.740]   Now I don't know if you've ever been in a place where you experience just pain, whether
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:13.880]   it's physical pain or emotional pain, where you're just longing, you're just longing to
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.880]   be well.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.560]   I just want to be well, I don't want to feel this pain anymore, I want to be able to sleep,
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.960]   I want to be able to sit.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.200]   I couldn't even tie my shoes, I couldn't even bend over to tie my shoes.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:30.000]   I don't want to ask my wife to tie my shoes, Lord.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.320]   So that's the place I was in.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.880]   So I went to the A&E room, to make a long story short, they end up admitting me to the
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:41.640]   hospital, they do surgery, there was an immediate relief, and I'm actually still recovering
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.980]   right now.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:47.840]   So recovering with a wound from the surgery, so that takes a while.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.320]   But I know I'm not alone in this.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.680]   That we all at one point or another, we long for healing.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.360]   For me it was longing for physical healing.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:03.080]   For you maybe it's emotional healing, mental healing, spiritual healing.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:08.000]   Maybe we know we're not right with Jesus, and for whatever reason we just struggle to
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.240]   be in the right place with Jesus, and we just long for spiritual healing.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:21.440]   And that sometimes we find ourselves in these places where we just cannot shake what is
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.440]   going on.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.800]   We just cannot break out of it.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:32.200]   There's nothing in our strength that we can do to feel better.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:39.160]   We're at the end of our ropes.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.920]   Now what do we do when we find ourselves in that place?
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:50.040]   Where can we find hope and help in our pain and in our suffering?
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.600]   Now that's the question that I want to explore with you.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.600]   What do we do?
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:00.920]   Now in some sense I think you know the answer that I'm going to give.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.840]   What answer am I going to give?
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.320]   Come to Jesus, of course.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.820]   But I want to unpack that in a deeper way.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:17.720]   I want to take a closer look with you at who Jesus is and who God's word says Jesus is.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.520]   And so unpack that question with us.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:25.120]   So we're going to look at one verse from Matthew, and then we're going to look at a passage
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.640]   from the book of Acts.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:32.840]   So let's start with a passage from Matthew, and I want to set the context for that.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:36.200]   So we're in the birth narrative of Jesus.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:44.440]   Joseph realizes that Mary is pregnant, and he silently wants to divorce her.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:51.040]   But then in a dream an angel appears to him and reveals to him that Mary, the child that
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.840]   Mary's carrying, is conceived through the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.880]   This is God's work.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.760]   And so it encourages Joseph to keep the child.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.320]   But then the angel gives further instructions.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.880]   So this is the verse that we want to read.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:08.720]   It's chapter 1, verse 21 in Matthew, and it says this.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:14.800]   He will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.920]   his people from their sins.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:26.200]   Now, if you notice, there's a connection between the name Jesus and that he will save people
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.680]   from their sins.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.240]   Now what is that connection?
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:35.440]   Well, let's look at what the name Jesus, where this comes from, and what the name Jesus actually
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.720]   means.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:46.760]   The name Jesus is a Greek translation of the Hebrew Yeshua, which is a version of Joshua.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.720]   In Joshua, the name means the Lord of salvation.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.720]   The Lord saves.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.440]   Yahweh saves.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:02.360]   So we can say that it's like you're supposed to name him the Lord saves, for he will save
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.000]   people from their sins.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.400]   So right up front, we're being told about who Jesus is, what his identity is, and what
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.000]   he is going to be doing.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.920]   But there's more.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.520]   The word that is used for save is sozo.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:26.320]   And sozo is a word that has very far-reaching, a very broad range of meaning.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:33.360]   Like the English doesn't fully capture it, or the word save doesn't fully capture it.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:39.720]   It can mean to save, to rescue, to heal, rescue from disease.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.760]   So I'm actually, even I was looking in the Greek dictionary, and I read like eight or
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:47.360]   nine different usage, and I was like, I'm not going to list 10 things here.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:53.720]   But the gist of it is to save, to rescue, to heal.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:48:00.280]   And so it says that Jesus will save, rescue, heal people from their sins.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:06.880]   Now a lot of times, or we're quite familiar with that it says that Jesus will heal people
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.260]   from their sins.
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:14.360]   But this would have actually been surprising to the contemporaries of Jesus that this is
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.680]   said about the Messiah.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.400]   That's actually not what they were expecting.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.680]   They were expecting a different type of Messiah, and I want to explain that.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:27.740]   What they were expecting, they experienced three large bondages.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:33.760]   There was the bondage with Exodus in Egypt, which you can read about in the story of Exodus,
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   in the book of Exodus.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.400]   There was the bondage in Babylon.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.680]   And then during Jesus' time, there was the bondage to the Romans.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.280]   So there was oppression, Roman oppression.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:51.160]   And so the contemporaries, they were expecting Jesus to come and to deliver them from that
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.160]   oppression of the Romans, or that a Messiah to come deliver them from the oppression of
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:49:01.120]   the Romans, and to set up the Davidic throne again.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.240]   So that's what people were expecting.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:08.560]   But in here, as it is announced who Jesus is, it says that he will save, that he will
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.040]   deliver, that he will heal people from their sins.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.400]   So why does focus on sin?
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.800]   So I want to go with you and look at the biblical storyline.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.600]   It can be broken down into four acts.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.760]   You can break it down different ways.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.600]   This is the simplest one.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:29.080]   You have creation, fall, redemption, new creation.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:35.520]   And if you want to understand why the focus is sin, we need to look at that bigger story.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.900]   So at the beginning, God created this world.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.560]   He created it good.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   Everything in it was good.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:47.360]   He created Adam and Eve in the image of God, and it was very good.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:53.480]   Now Adam and Eve, they got to enjoy God's presence, live in God's presence, walk, talk
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.200]   with God.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.940]   But then something happens.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.440]   They rebel against God.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:06.720]   Instead of being under his loving rule, they give in to temptation, and sin enters the
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.720]   world.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.240]   That's what we refer to as the fall.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:17.740]   Now sin, the effect of sin is far more far-reaching than a lot of times when we make it.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.880]   Sin has impacted every fabric of human life.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:28.240]   It's our relationship with God, our relationship with each other as people, our relationship
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.960]   with creation, and even our relationship with ourselves.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:42.760]   So sin touches every fabric of this world, and there's damage to everything.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:51.000]   Now God didn't leave us in this damaged state, so he starts this process of redemption.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.700]   And that's the story of Abraham, of Israel, and then ultimately of Jesus, who comes to
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:04.280]   bring healing and restoration to all these different ways that sin has broken down our
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.400]   lives.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.520]   So it's a holistic salvation.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.800]   It's a holistic healing.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:16.320]   A lot of times when you talk about sin and Jesus dying for our sins and addressing sin,
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.760]   we focus on our relationship with God, that he restores our relationship with God, that
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.960]   he brings us into the family of God.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.120]   And that is the central thing in Scripture.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.760]   That is the central thing.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:30.940]   But salvation is so much broader.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:32.400]   It's not just that.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:38.200]   He wants to bring healing to us emotionally, spiritually, physically, in every aspect,
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:45.240]   and then ultimately lead us to new creation where all of who we are, everything is brought
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.280]   to wholeness.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.280]   There's no more pain.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.600]   There's no more tears.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:52.040]   There's no more suffering.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:59.720]   And so what is being announced in this passage in Matthew is that Jesus has come to bring
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:08.200]   complete wholeness into our lives, physical, emotional, relational, and spiritual wholeness.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:13.880]   So when we say that Jesus is healer, he brings healing and has the power to bring healing
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.920]   to every aspect of who we are.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.240]   He cares about everything.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.920]   And so we don't want to minimize that and play that down and make it smaller.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:31.200]   Jesus' salvation is broad and wide and so much wider than we often imagine.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.600]   So he cares about our broken relationships.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.160]   He cares about brokenness inside of us.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.600]   He cares about our character.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:42.240]   He cares about injustices in this world.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:46.440]   And he's working to bring wholeness to all of those things in life.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.680]   And one day, this work will be completed.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:55.280]   But right now in Jesus, the kingdom of God has broken into this world.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:00.000]   This new creation, the saving work has broken into this world.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.800]   And we as a church, we are a new community that God has formed where he reveals the saving
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:14.760]   and this healing work through us and the work he's doing in our lives.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:20.240]   So Jesus' name, it means he's savior and he's healer.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:26.160]   And it's so much broader than we often give Jesus credit for.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.840]   So that's the passage in Matthew.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.640]   I'm going to be shorter on the passage in Acts.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.680]   Now set the context for the story in Acts.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:41.200]   So Peter and John, this is after Pentecost and all of that.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.320]   So they go up to the Jerusalem temple and they end up healing.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:48.600]   Peter ends up healing a lame man.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.360]   And he can walk.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.280]   Now this stirs up some excitement.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:57.960]   And the authorities, they want to -- remember, they just crucified Jesus.
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.160]   So they don't want this movement to gain any momentum.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.160]   They arrest them.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.160]   They put them in jail.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:09.080]   And the next day they come and they ask them to let them know by which name did you heal,
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.080]   do this healing.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.080]   And so that's where we pick up the story.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.320]   It's Acts chapter 4, verse 8.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.880]   And it says this.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.900]   Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of the people,
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:32.300]   if you are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to man who is lame
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:39.540]   and are being asked how he was healed, then know this, you and all the people of Israel.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:46.460]   It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, but whom God raised from
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:50.980]   the dead, that this man stands before you healed.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:58.940]   Jesus is the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:05.580]   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:11.380]   by which we must be saved."
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:17.820]   Now what I love about this passage is that nobody's denying this healing that has taken
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:18.820]   place.
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:19.820]   It was so obvious.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:22.940]   Perhaps the authorities even saw it themselves.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:27.320]   This guy had experienced a miraculous healing to his body.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.180]   Nobody could deny it.
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:33.220]   And when the authorities ask him, "By what power or what name did you do this?"
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:39.300]   Peter emphatically says, "It is in the name of Jesus that this man was healed, whom you
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:42.700]   crucified, but who was raised from the dead."
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:53.460]   He has the power to heal and to restore, and it's only in his name that there is salvation.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:57.700]   It's only in his name that there's healing.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:03.460]   Now here the word you see it's highlighted healed and saved.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.420]   It's again this word "sozo."
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:09.180]   It's actually the same word, but it's translated in one part as healed and the other one saved.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:19.140]   Again, Jesus' healing work is so much broader than we give Jesus credit to.
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:23.820]   And then the phrase in verse 12, "No other name under heaven given to mankind by which
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:25.620]   we must be saved."
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:34.220]   It's actually a radical statement because what Peter is saying through this is that
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:42.540]   the temple is obsolete, that the authorities that he's talking to, that healing is not
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:46.420]   found in them because Jesus has fulfilled the temple.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:51.940]   He has created now the body of Christ as a new temple filled with a spirit.
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:56.940]   And so if you want healing, if you want salvation, you cannot bypass Jesus.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:57:02.180]   So like I said, this is a radical statement as conversation with authorities, what he's
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:05.300]   saying, even what he's saying about them crucifying them and everything.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:10.140]   So he's speaking very plainly but truthfully.
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:18.660]   So we see that both in Matthew and in Acts, that answers the question, when we have pain,
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:20.940]   when we have suffering, what do we do?
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:21.940]   Where do we go?
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:33.380]   And it says that salvation, that healing is found in no one else but Jesus.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:37.660]   It's found in no one else but Jesus.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:41.420]   What I, initially when I was looking at this passage, I was like, "Am I going to talk about
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:44.300]   the apologetics, you know, why that is?"
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:47.800]   But actually Peter just bears witness to this.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.340]   This is what Jesus has done.
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:55.260]   And so what I want to do is I actually just want to share my testimony.
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:58:09.780]   I want to share how Jesus has met me in pain, in my own personal darkness and suffering,
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:16.660]   and how no one else could help me, not the people around me that loved me, not my family.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.660]   Now they were helpful.
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:26.900]   I don't want to say they were not helpful, but healing was only found in Jesus.
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:31.360]   And I did ask my wife, Chris, for permission to share the story.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.300]   I always ask her before I talk about this.
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:35.620]   I haven't talked to you guys about this.
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.340]   I've talked to Manchai about this previously.
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:42.460]   I've alluded to it here.
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:46.220]   I was married before.
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:55.500]   And in my first, my first wife, she came to me one day and she told me that she was not
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:59.380]   feeling good about our marriage.
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:06.660]   She also told me that she wasn't feeling good about me being a pastor.
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.580]   So this was in 2017.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:18.340]   And so I started the process of stepping down from being a senior pastor of a small church.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.100]   And of course, this takes a little time.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:22.380]   So this was a three-month process.
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:27.020]   The last, the Saturday before my last Sunday, where my last time I'm preaching, farewell
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:31.620]   party, all of that, she tells me she needs to talk to me.
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.500]   But she only wants to talk to me with a therapist.
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.020]   I was like, okay.
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:37.340]   So we, she finds a therapist online.
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:42.260]   We go and talk to a therapist and she tells me that she doesn't want to be with me.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:44.580]   She doesn't want to talk to me.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:47.380]   And she wants to separate from me.
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:54.420]   And that she only wants to talk to me with a therapist.
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:55.900]   And I was caught off guard.
[00:59:55.900 --> 01:00:01.500]   Now, obviously, I knew that our marriage was not doing well.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.500]   But this caught me off guard.
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:09.380]   So at this time, I'm, you know, I'm stepping down from the job that I love.
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.620]   So I'm losing my job.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.620]   We had sold our house.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.740]   We were going to move in a new apartment.
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:16.140]   Now she was moving into apartment.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:18.420]   I didn't have anywhere to go.
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.420]   So I lost my house.
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:25.060]   And it looked like I'm also losing my marriage.
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:31.460]   And so we went through the, we went through the meeting with a therapist for three months.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:36.900]   And then she concluded, you know, that there was no hope for us and ended up fighting for
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.380]   divorce.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:46.660]   And you know, as a pastor, I helped other people see marriages restored.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:54.900]   But I, but I couldn't do this for myself.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:59.180]   And there was so much shame in that.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:05.980]   You know, when your life, what you believe is right and everything, when it breaks down.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.180]   And I felt powerless.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.140]   It was nothing that I knew how to do or what I was able to do.
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:14.420]   And I felt acted upon.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:21.720]   And I also, this was, this was very traumatic for me.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.020]   Because I didn't see it coming.
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:30.540]   I lost my job, my wife, my home.
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.300]   And so I really didn't know what to do.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:37.940]   You know, what do you do?
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:44.620]   So I ended up, well, for one, I ended up taking a job and I had a finance background.
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.780]   So I went the mortgage industry, which I couldn't stand.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.900]   I'm like, every day, I'm like, I don't like this.
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:49.900]   I love being a pastor.
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.940]   Why am I doing this?
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:57.580]   But I really was, I really felt like I don't know how to move forward.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:01.140]   And I had no hope for the future.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.560]   Like, I couldn't anticipate something good happened.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:11.980]   And I really said, Lord, if, you know, if you want to take me, take me.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.580]   I don't care if I live anymore or not.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:20.260]   And so, I mean, I was just broken.
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:21.260]   I had nothing.
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.340]   I didn't know what to do.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:29.980]   And nobody, like I said, my family, they loved me, but they couldn't help.
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.660]   But in this time, I went to church.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.700]   I went to other churches.
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:40.760]   But then after two months of doing that, I asked the pastor that took over if he minded
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.420]   if I come back to the church I was before.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:47.300]   Because that's where all my friendships were.
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:51.980]   And it was, of course, embarrassing to go back to the church and people asking about
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.980]   your relationship.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.620]   And, you know, there was a lot of shame.
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.300]   But I was like, I don't know what else to do.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.460]   So I went back there.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.660]   And it was hard.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:11.260]   And then on one Sunday, during worship, this is the part I've told before, Jesus had a
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.260]   word for me.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:17.020]   And he said, I'm not finished with you yet.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.580]   I felt like he had finished with me.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:26.380]   I felt like my life was over.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:33.900]   And I didn't realize it at the time, but those words were healing words, you know, that Jesus
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:41.700]   spoke over me because he released faith and courage that I did not have.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:47.460]   Oh, apparently I need this.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:53.620]   Thanks, Debra.
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:59.340]   And then if Jesus is okay with me, well, then I must be okay.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:06.460]   And if Jesus is okay with me, then perhaps maybe I can be a pastor one day again.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:15.420]   And if Jesus is not finished with me, you know, I can be one day whole again.
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:20.380]   And so I actually, when I heard those words, I went outside and I was just sobbing and
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:24.100]   it was healing.
[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:28.420]   So then to make a long, honestly, there's so many details in all of this, but to make
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:33.860]   a longer story short, you know, I ended up being hired by the Vine.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:36.420]   These words of Jesus were the beginning of healing.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.580]   This was a turning point.
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.580]   This healing journey has continued.
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:48.540]   I have had a lot of anxiety and fear and felt rejection and abandonment because when somebody
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:54.020]   leaves you, you wonder, is there something wrong with me?
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.020]   Am I not lovable?
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:05:01.820]   You know, what makes somebody leave you?
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:05.580]   And so I felt these feelings in a lot of relationships and with coworkers and things.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.220]   If anything shifted, I started feeling anxiety.
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.340]   I started feeling physical pain.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.620]   And but Jesus has brought healing.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:21.500]   And I have to give credit to the Vine and to Pastor Andrew.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.980]   Like I mean, I was obviously very open in my interview about all these things.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:29.620]   And I was not functioning well when they hired me.
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.460]   I was like at 65% or something.
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:37.540]   Every Sunday I was crying and weeping.
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.940]   And so at one time he came and he had a prophetic work on top of me already crying.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.700]   And then I even just lost it.
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:47.060]   This was after three months of being in the church.
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:50.580]   And then I saw him the next week and I went to him and was like, Andrew, I'm so sorry
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.820]   that I keep losing it.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:58.900]   You know, I keep totally, I mean, I'm not even able to minister to any people on a Sunday.
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.060]   You know, I'm just a mess.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.900]   And he told me, Tim, why do you need to be sorry?
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:09.620]   It's a beautiful thing that you allow yourself to be ministered to by the Holy Spirit.
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:17.580]   I was like, wow, what kind of church is this?
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:23.700]   I can tell you if I would be at another church, I can do that once, maybe twice.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:28.020]   But at the third time, the pastor would tell me to get my act together or to leave.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:35.980]   You know, and I also want to give, you know, part of my healing journey, of course, was
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:42.020]   also meeting Chris, my wife, having my daughter Ellie.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.420]   And so God really turned my life around.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:48.780]   Being part of this church plant, I mean, I thought I had lost everything.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:53.500]   And God has restored all these things in such a short period of time.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.340]   And for me, and I don't know why I'm sharing this thought, but I felt like I should share
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:00.420]   this, so I think this is for someone.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:03.780]   I was thinking of Ellie.
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:15.020]   I was like, God always knew that Ellie would exist.
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:19.780]   And you know, that just really has touched me, that God always knew that she would exist,
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.420]   that she has a purpose, that he loves her.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:31.220]   So anyhow, like, I usually, if you're here for the first time, I usually cry like this.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:38.780]   Since we're talking about healing and longing for healing, so for me, it's important that
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:44.340]   we are a church, that we have a church culture where we can share our brokenness, where we
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:49.700]   can bring our full selves into this community and where we can share.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:55.620]   And it doesn't matter if that's a, you know, what it is, a small or a big thing.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:01.180]   But if we just come and pretend we're all doing great and we're all these amazing Christians
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:06.180]   with no problems and no issues, no need for healing, you know, we're going to miss out
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.660]   on what Jesus wants to do in our lives.
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.300]   I don't want to miss it.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.740]   And so I wanted to give Jesus glory.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:14.340]   I want to praise Jesus for his work in my life.
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:19.140]   And I want to ask the worship team to actually come up right now.
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:25.300]   And I want to say if Jesus has done this in my life, how he has met me in brokenness and
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:36.460]   emotional pain and in darkness, you know, has brought healing, I know that he can also
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.780]   do that in your life.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:42.520]   I know he can do it in your life.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.260]   And so what I want to encourage you right now, so one thing we do a lot of times as
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:51.420]   divine churches, we actually have a time of prayer.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:57.940]   And so if you, if there's something that you need, you know, you need healing from, where
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:03.660]   you want Jesus to touch you or to speak over your life and to just start this process of
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:08.380]   rest, restoring you, of bringing wholeness, of making you well, it doesn't matter if it's
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:14.980]   emotional, physically, spiritually, I want to encourage you to just stretch out your
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.940]   hands before you.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.300]   Then when you stretch out your hands before you, I want to encourage others around you
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:27.060]   just to come and just to pray for you, just to pray over you.
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:32.140]   And I know this takes courage, but I want to encourage you to do it.
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:36.980]   You know, Jesus is not finished with you yet.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.220]   Jesus is not finished with you if you're struggling with pornography addiction.
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.340]   He's not finished with you yet.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:47.100]   He's not finished if your marriage is struggling.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.580]   He's not finished with you yet.
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:53.380]   You know, whatever is going on, Jesus is not finished.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.180]   So just stretch out your hands.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.540]   And I just want to encourage people around you to pray.
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:02.620]   So we're going to take a few minutes to pray, and then I'll close in prayers.
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.420]   Let's do this right now.
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.420]   Thank you.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:22.380]   So if you see someone with their hands stretched out, please go to them and pray for them.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.580]   Don't let somebody just sit there with their hands stretched out.
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.580]   Okay?
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.580]   Thank you.
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:33.580]   Can we turn my microphone off for this part, please?
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.580]   Thank you.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:42.580]   Thank you.
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:49.580]   Thank you.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:11:04.580]   Thank you.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:19.580]   Thank you.
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:34.580]   Thank you.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:49.580]   Thank you.
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:12:04.580]   Thank you.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:19.580]   Thank you.
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:34.580]   Thank you.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:49.580]   Thank you.
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:13:04.580]   Thank you.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:19.580]   Thank you.
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:34.580]   Thank you.
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:49.580]   Thank you.
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:14:04.580]   Thank you.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:19.580]   Thank you.
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:34.580]   Thank you.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:49.580]   Thank you.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:15:04.580]   Thank you.
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:19.580]   Thank you.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:34.580]   Thank you.
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:49.580]   Thank you.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:59.580]   Thank you.
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:07.580]   Thank you.
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:12.580]   I'm going to pray, but do feel free to continue to pray.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:16.580]   Jesus, thank you that your name means healer.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:18.580]   You are a healer.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:27.580]   There is no other name in which you find healing, in which we find your restoration, and where
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.580]   we are made whole.
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:33.580]   And Jesus, you've heard all these prayers, and even the ones that are going to be prayed
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:34.580]   after this.
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:44.580]   And I pray that you do beautiful work of just your restoration, of moving us to wholeness,
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:52.580]   of providing in the area of need, of removing and lifting us out of some of that pain and
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:56.580]   suffering in a way that only you are able to.
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:07.580]   And may this be a turning point for us, where your work is unfolding in our community.
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:14.580]   I pray that we can be a community of healing, where people can come and bring whatever has
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:17.580]   happened in their lives, and they can come to you, Jesus.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:22.580]   And we can point them to you, and we can encourage each other, and we can pray for each other.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   And Holy Spirit, I just thank you for your healing work.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:31.580]   Thank you that you're working right now, and we give you all the praise.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.580]   In your name, Jesus.
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:34.580]   Amen.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:38.580]   So if you want to continue praying, feel free to pray, but also I want to invite those who
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:41.580]   are ready to worship to stand up, and let's worship.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:08.580]   I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind.
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:13.580]   I know there is peace within your presence.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:21.580]   I speak Jesus.
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:33.580]   I just want to speak the name of Jesus 'til every dark addiction starts to break.
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:45.580]   Declaring there is hope and there is freedom, I speak Jesus.
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:58.580]   Your name is power, your name is healing, your name is life.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:12.580]   Break every stronghold, shine through the shadows, burn like a fire.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:24.580]   I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind.
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:30.580]   'Cause I know there is peace within your presence.
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:33.580]   I speak Jesus.
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:36.580]   One more time, verse one.
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:49.580]   Oh, I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:55.580]   'Cause I know there is peace within your presence.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:20:01.580]   I speak Jesus.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:13.580]   Your name is power, your name is healing, your name is life.
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:22.580]   Break every stronghold, shine through the shadows, burn like a fire.
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:38.580]   Your name is power, your name is power, your name is healing, your name is life.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:53.580]   Break every stronghold, shine through the shadows, burn like a fire.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.580]   Wow.
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:59.580]   Is that, am I the only one feeling that in the room?
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.580]   Not right.
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:08.580]   Church, I want you to come in the next couple of weeks with a different expectation.
[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:16.580]   I believe what Tim has been sharing today, it's raising the bar of faith in this community, in this room.
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:20.580]   Come with a different expectation in the following weeks.
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:28.580]   We're starting to talk about the healing of God, the physical healing, the emotional healing, the mental healing, the spiritual healing.
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:34.580]   We're releasing this truth in this place and we are expecting to see healing in this room.
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:37.580]   And today, it is just the beginning.
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:40.580]   This is just for you to taste it a little bit.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:45.580]   We're going deeper and deeper and deeper into the healing truth of God.
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.580]   Something is gonna be different.
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:52.580]   You could expect when people walk through these doors, they will get healed.
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:55.580]   They will get so-soed in this place.
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:59.580]   Am I the only one believing that in this room?
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:03.580]   If not, can I get an amen for that?
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:08.580]   If you have faith in that, we gotta express it, church.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:09.580]   Don't be shy.
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:12.580]   We're here to speak the name of Jesus.
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.580]   We're here to speak that name.
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.580]   There's no other name.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:18.580]   We're going to speak that name.
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:22.580]   The name that means salvation, the name that means healing,
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:29.580]   we're here to declare it over every stronghold, every darkness in our lives, in our families, in our city.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.580]   We're gonna do that.
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:34.580]   And so we're gonna sing this one more time.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:36.580]   We're going to declare that name.
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:42.580]   If this is a powerful name, I want you to believe it and sing it powerfully.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:46.580]   Let the way you sing match the way you believe.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:48.580]   Can we do that, church?
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:50.580]   All right, there's like two people.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:52.580]   I hear two people.
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:54.580]   Are we gonna do this, church?
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:55.580]   Let's do this.
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:56.580]   Come on.
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:23:03.580]   Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets.
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:09.580]   Jesus in the darkness over every enemy.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:12.580]   Jesus for my family.
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:21.580]   I speak the holy name, Jesus.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:28.580]   Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets.
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:34.580]   Jesus in the darkness over every enemy.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.580]   Jesus for my family.
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:42.580]   I speak the holy name, Jesus.
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:45.580]   Your name is power.
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:48.580]   Your name is power.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.580]   Your name is healing.
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:57.580]   Your name is life.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.580]   Break every stronghold.
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:08.580]   Shine through the shadows.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:11.580]   Burn like a fire.
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:15.580]   Your name, your name is power.
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:18.580]   Your name is healing.
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:24.580]   Your name is life.
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:27.580]   Break every stronghold.
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:31.580]   Shine through the shadows.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:37.580]   Burn like a fire.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.580]   Oh, I'm just so excited about this.
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.580]   I hope you're excited as well.
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:44.580]   Because something is gonna change in this place.
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:49.580]   As this word is declared, something is gonna be different in our community.
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.580]   We're gonna see healing.
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:53.580]   Because now we know the truth.
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:59.580]   We know that that name means the name above every name in this universe.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:02.580]   We know that name means healing.
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:06.580]   And we're gonna live out this truth in this place.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:15.580]   And God, we're just so excited about what you're going to do in and through this church community.
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.580]   This healing is not just for us.
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.580]   It's not just for the people standing in this room.
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:24.580]   It has to go through us into the community of Yuen Long, into Hong Kong as well.
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:30.580]   So God, I thank you that because of the faithful preaching of Pastor Tim today,
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:38.580]   there will be a faithful people here in Yuen Long believing, knowing that Jesus, you are the healer.
[01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:45.580]   That we're going to live, we're going to go back to where we are and bringing this truth into our communities.
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:50.580]   We're going to bring this healing into the places that you brought us to, Lord.
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:56.580]   And we are going to declare that you are healer to this city, Lord.
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:58.580]   We're going to declare that.
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:04.580]   We're going to see the kind of healing that could only take place through you, Lord.
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:09.580]   And so God, I pray today you will come and change us.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:15.580]   If we have so-called, if we have made peace with sickness, if we have made peace with brokenness,
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:19.580]   where we say, "All right, just stay in my life. That's all right. You're here."
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:25.580]   It's time that we say, "No, sorry. You got to get out of here because I belong to Jesus."
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:29.580]   You got to get out of my life because I belong to Jesus.
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:34.580]   And this is the declaration of this church here and in our city.
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:42.580]   So God, we just pray you would come and give us a new level of faith through this message, through this sermon series.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:43.580]   Come and change us.
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.580]   God, I thank you.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:46.580]   We praise you.
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:48.580]   We love you.
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:50.580]   We worship you.
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.580]   And in the name of Jesus, we pray.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.580]   Everybody say, "Amen."
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:56.580]   Amen.
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:58.580]   Can we put our hands together for Jesus?
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:06.580]   And can we, church, can I invite you to put our hands together for Pastor Tim?
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:09.580]   Tim, we love you.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.580]   We love you.
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:15.580]   We cannot ask for another pastor for our church.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:23.580]   We love you.
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.580]   Yes, you can have more hugs.
