1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,340
 Oh, full, okay.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,980
 Today's gonna be fun.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,740
 We're gonna be going through the parables again.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,860
 This is week two.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,540
 And just a bit of a reminder,

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,780
 kind of a recap for all of us to get back on the same page

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,780
 'cause I sometimes talk too fast

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,860
 and I don't want anyone to get lost,

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,940
 so let me just kind of lay out what we're doing.

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,980
 Picking up in the parables,

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,900
 we're gonna remember and recall the idea

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,100
 that the purpose of parables, pretty simple.

14
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,700
 There's these big profound truths

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,780
 about the kingdom of God, about the kingdom of heaven,

16
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,540
 about the Father that can be challenging

17
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,020
 for us to fully grasp.

18
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,540
 So Jesus knowing that provided these parables

19
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,580
 ways for us to be able to understand,

20
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,500
 for us to peel back into some of those layers.

21
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,940
 So using stories sometimes is the best way.

22
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,860
 So that's why we're doing this sermon series.

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,200
 We've got four parables.

24
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,700
 Last week, if you were here,

25
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,260
 Pastor Ellison walked us through the parable of the sower.

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,160
 We saw all the different ideas of where the seed is thrown

27
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,580
 and ultimately the story and the meaning behind that

28
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,860
 was the soil of our hearts.

29
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,660
 We need to make sure the soil of our hearts

30
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,320
 is fertile ground for the word of God

31
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,300
 to actually be planted and to bloom and to live within us.

32
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,420
 This week, we're gonna turn our attention

33
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,980
 towards Luke 15, looking at the parable

34
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,020
 of the prodigal son, or the lost son, or the two sons.

35
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,180
 Now this parable is, it's one of three actually in Luke 15.

36
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,020
 Why do you keep saying John?

37
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,020
 In Luke 15.

38
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,140
 So Jesus starts off by talking about some sheep

39
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,260
 and about how there's all these sheep this guy has

40
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,540
 and then he loses one and he goes and finds it

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,860
 and he rejoices, he's like,

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,460
 "Celebrate with me, my lost sheep is back."

43
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,900
 And then he goes to a coin.

44
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,860
 This lady has a bunch of coins and she loses one

45
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,500
 and she looks everywhere and finds the one coin

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,400
 and she celebrates, she says,

47
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,260
 "Guys, come celebrate with me, rejoice, I found my coin."

48
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,820
 And then so he takes the sheep, the coin,

49
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,340
 and then he like jumps like a massive level

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,980
 and then brings it to family,

51
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,540
 talks about sons and about fathers

52
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,860
 and about the relationship and ends up looking at lost sons

53
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,460
 and that whole journey.

54
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,500
 And so normally here at the Vine,

55
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,100
 what we would do is we would put up the text behind us

56
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,940
 and we would all read it,

57
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,660
 or I would read it and you would watch.

58
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,340
 But in the spirit of this being a parable,

59
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,580
 I kinda wanna take us to that posture

60
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,860
 of what it would have been like to hear it

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,780
 for the first time.

62
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,300
 So back when Jesus was preaching,

63
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,140
 he didn't have PowerPoints,

64
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,220
 there wasn't a great creative team

65
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,140
 to make it all look nice.

66
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,720
 So we're gonna go back to that space just for a minute.

67
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,660
 You won't be able to read along, that's on purpose,

68
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,620
 we're not gonna put the scripture up.

69
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,220
 I'm gonna tell you the story.

70
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,540
 And one of the ways I feel like

71
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,820
 it can really help you dive into this

72
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,340
 is if you sit back, relax, take a breath, get comfortable,

73
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,700
 close your eyes, but don't fall asleep, okay?

74
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,820
 Okay, I saw someone at 9.15,

75
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,140
 I didn't clarify that the first time.

76
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,060
 Close your eyes, I'm just gonna tell you the story,

77
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,020
 I'm not actually gonna read it either,

78
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,340
 I'm gonna give you a rendition of it.

79
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,180
 And then what we're gonna do

80
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,100
 is we're gonna look at the characters,

81
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,540
 at what lessons is Jesus really wanting us

82
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,440
 to pull from this.

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,340
 And actually, hopefully, understand more about God,

84
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,060
 and understand more about the kingdom of God.

85
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,940
 So let me pray, and then you can close your eyes,

86
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,780
 and we're gonna get started.

87
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,300
 Jesus, we thank you for your word.

88
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,940
 We thank you that you understood the human condition,

89
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,020
 and that we sometimes need stories

90
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,060
 to really understand and wrestle with your truth.

91
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,540
 So Holy Spirit, would you just be with us this morning

92
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,340
 as we look at this story of the two sons?

93
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,540
 Would you open our eyes, open our ears,

94
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,860
 to hear what it is that you want us to know

95
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,020
 about who you are, about the Father,

96
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,980
 and about the kingdom of God?

97
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,260
 We ask you these things in Jesus' name, amen.

98
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,180
 All right, eyes closed, here we go.

99
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,360
 There was a dude, there was a man,

100
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
 there was an older guy who had two sons.

101
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,100
 He had these two kids, and the youngest of the two kids

102
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,160
 was a little crazy.

103
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,520
 He was like, "God, give me my inheritance now."

104
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,840
 So Dad gave him his inheritance.

105
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,160
 He divided up his property

106
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,880
 and gave his son his inheritance early.

107
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,720
 And what did the son do?

108
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,400
 The son set off for a distant land, went far away,

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,400
 and he spent all of his money on wild, reckless living.

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,980
 And then, when he has no more money,

111
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,220
 just at that point, the nation that he's in

112
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,280
 goes into famine.

113
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,540
 They can't grow any food, there's no water,

114
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,540
 everything is tight and challenging,

115
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,300
 and he's hit rock bottom with money,

116
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,940
 and now the land he's in has no food,

117
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,100
 and there's no opportunity for him,

118
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,820
 and he's really looking for a place to go,

119
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,160
 and he doesn't have any money, so he tries to get a job.

120
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,380
 He can't find anyone to give him a job,

121
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,540
 so he sees this one position open,

122
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,240
 and it's a pretty unfun position, it's feeding pigs.

123
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,700
 So he takes the job feeding the pigs,

124
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,140
 and while he's out there feeding the pigs one day,

125
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,980
 making very little money, he's so hungry,

126
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,580
 I mean, he's desperately hungry,

127
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,660
 that the food the pigs are eating looks appetizing,

128
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,140
 so he wants to eat that.

129
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,460
 And then he has this moment where he comes to his senses,

130
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,580
 he's like, "Hold on, in my dad's house,

131
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,360
 "you know, the servants have food to spare."

132
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
 So he's like, "You know what I'll do?

133
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,800
 "I'll pack up my things, and I'll go back to my dad,

134
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,180
 "and I'll tell him, 'Dad, I've sinned against heaven,

135
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,880
 "'and against you, I'm no longer worthy

136
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,720
 "'to be called your son, but if you would just give me

137
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,640
 "'a position as a servant.'"

138
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,320
 So he got his little speech together,

139
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,960
 and he picked up nothing that he had,

140
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,720
 and just walked back, started going back.

141
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,220
 And while he was a long ways off,

142
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,220
 the father sees him, and in his compassion, in his joy,

143
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,540
 he runs to his son, and throws his arms around him,

144
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,640
 and kisses him, and the son's like,

145
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,340
 "Father, I'm no longer worthy to be called your son,

146
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,660
 "I have sinned against heaven, and against you."

147
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,600
 And the father stops him, and he's like,

148
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,080
 "Y'all, let's celebrate.

149
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,720
 "Go get the fattest cow we have.

150
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,800
 "Bring a ring and put it on his hand.

151
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,760
 "Grab some sandals for him, put a robe around him.

152
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,580
 "My son, who was lost, is now found."

153
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,660
 So they did, they got a party together.

154
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,940
 And the older son, who was there, was out in the fields,

155
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,980
 and he was working, and he heard all this ruckus,

156
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,500
 and this noise, so he makes his way back over.

157
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,820
 He's asking the servants, "What's going on?"

158
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,420
 Servants like, "Your brother, who was lost, is back.

159
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,780
 "Your dad's killed the biggest cow that we have for him."

160
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,780
 So brother gets a bit annoyed and frustrated,

161
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,560
 so annoyed that he won't even go into the celebration.

162
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,260
 The father comes out, and pleased with his son,

163
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,660
 and his son's like, "Dad, I've been here the whole time.

164
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,460
 "I've never disobeyed a word that you said,

165
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,000
 "and you've not even killed a goat for me,

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,400
 "for me and my friends."

167
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,460
 The dad says, "You have me with you always,

168
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,280
 "but listen, we have to rejoice.

169
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,760
 "We have to celebrate, because your brother,

170
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,020
 "who was once lost, is now found."

171
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,980
 You can open your eyes again.

172
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,300
 This is one of the most beautiful stories of love

173
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,780
 in all of Scripture.

174
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,820
 It's incredible, right, but it's complex.

175
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,320
 It's deep, and it revolves around

176
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,220
 these three main characters.

177
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,660
 There's the father, there's the son,

178
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,180
 who runs away and squanders all the money,

179
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,300
 and then there's the son, who stays

180
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,100
 and has something to say to the dad.

181
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,660
 And I think what Jesus meant to do

182
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,380
 was for us to look at these three characters,

183
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,100
 look at the concepts of the story,

184
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,500
 and really understand what the kingdom of heaven is like,

185
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,340
 and what the father himself is like.

186
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,940
 So we're gonna do that by first looking at the first son,

187
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,260
 and seeing what lesson does Jesus ultimately

188
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,080
 wanna teach us through this first son.

189
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,940
 So that first son, the one that runs away,

190
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,880
 gets the money, runs off, goes to a faraway land.

191
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
 I found this detail very interesting.

192
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,760
 He goes far away.

193
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,680
 He gets his money, rather than going next door

194
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,440
 or going to the neighboring, he goes to a distant land,

195
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,560
 away from everyone, to do his own thing.

196
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,360
 Doesn't wanna be in a relationship with anybody anymore,

197
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,680
 doesn't want any accountability,

198
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,640
 wants to go and do his own thing.

199
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,600
 So he does that, he emancipates himself,

200
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,800
 he removes himself from the family.

201
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,780
 He goes and he has no stewardship at all, no home training.

202
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,060
 He spends all his money and does a poor job budgeting.

203
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,420
 And once that's done, the land ends up in famine,

204
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,100
 which is terrible, so now he's hitting rock bottom.

205
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,620
 There's nothing he can do to get himself back up.

206
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,140
 He said he's eating the food of pigs,

207
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,260
 and I think we're all familiar with that part.

208
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,460
 His life literally couldn't get any worse,

209
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,500
 and I think it's really interesting,

210
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,100
 'cause I think maybe for lots of us

211
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,080
 who might have hit a version of rock bottom,

212
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,300
 we found this, in that moment of rock bottom,

213
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,580
 something clicks.

214
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,460
 He has a bit of an experience, something changes.

215
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,680
 It says that he comes to his senses.

216
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,160
 I think the first truth that we see around this parable

217
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,620
 is what repentance is.

218
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,740
 Repentance is much like coming to your senses.

219
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,740
 To come to one's senses would mean that

220
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,980
 whatever you might have believed prior to that moment,

221
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,340
 you now understand is incorrect, it was misleading.

222
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,160
 It was an illusion, or at best, it was incomplete.

223
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,740
 And all the son had done before,

224
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,500
 all of his actions of reckless spending and running away

225
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,900
 and taking his dad's stuff,

226
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,740
 was based off of his perspective,

227
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,700
 based off of the way that he saw things.

228
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,540
 And so to repent, that first stage looks like

229
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,100
 changing the way that we see, coming to our senses.

230
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,660
 To repent is to have a new perspective.

231
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,440
 It must mean that we have to think differently

232
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,040
 about our situation, about our sin.

233
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
 We must have that change of perspective

234
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,520
 and that coming to our senses.

235
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,200
 But we know, we all know that it doesn't end there, right?

236
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,720
 Repentance can't just be the way that you see things.

237
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,400
 It can't just be about more head knowledge

238
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,120
 or more information.

239
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,440
 Just because you understand more

240
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,160
 or because you have more information

241
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,080
 doesn't really make the change, does it?

242
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,480
 I mean, think about our culture today.

243
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,720
 We have access to the most amount of information

244
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,540
 ever than any period in history.

245
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,800
 That doesn't necessarily mean

246
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,120
 that things are changing for the better.

247
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,720
 What we don't need is necessarily more information.

248
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,040
 Sometimes what we do need is more obedience.

249
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,640
 And what does information do if there is no action?

250
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,240
 So although, yes, repentance will start

251
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,160
 with that turning of the mind

252
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,800
 and more information being changed,

253
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,800
 it must lead, it mandates that we then turn our will,

254
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,080
 that we then turn our actions,

255
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,200
 that we then turn ourselves.

256
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,160
 You're probably wondering why am I saying the word turn?

257
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,780
 Well, the word repent itself means to turn.

258
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,200
 So if I'm repenting, if I'm walking this way,

259
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
 to repent would mean to turn around, right?

260
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,880
 So that's what this young man is doing.

261
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,760
 He is turning around in his mind and his perspective,

262
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,120
 but then he also physically turns around.

263
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,360
 He returns to the Father.

264
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,660
 He leaves his foolish thinking and his foolish living,

265
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,040
 and he makes his way back to the Father.

266
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,800
 And what Jesus partially tells us this story

267
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,240
 so that we can get to this next part

268
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,460
 about what happens next,

269
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,320
 when we would turn and we would repent,

270
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,540
 which is actually the reason I was so excited

271
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,360
 about preaching this specific sermon

272
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,200
 is for this next section.

273
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,560
 The son that repents and turns, what happens to him next?

274
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,960
 The story goes that, well, the Father does something crazy,

275
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,960
 does something radical, something that is off script

276
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,480
 that no one would expect, right?

277
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,560
 The Father isn't reckless.

278
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,800
 The Father is responding to deep love.

279
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,400
 The Father is calculated.

280
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,760
 The actions of the Father

281
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,960
 are therefore interested in restoring.

282
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,800
 The text would say this,

283
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,240
 while he was a long way off, speaking of the son,

284
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,780
 his father saw him and was filled with compassion.

285
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,880
 He ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.

286
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,760
 The son said, "Father, I've sinned against heaven

287
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,600
 "and against you.

288
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,080
 "I'm no longer worthy to be called your son."

289
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,180
 But the father said to his servants,

290
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,400
 "Quick, bring the best robe, put it on him.

291
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,580
 "Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.

292
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,040
 "Bring the fattened calf and kill it.

293
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,520
 "Let's have a feast and celebrate,

294
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,680
 "for the son of mine was dead and is alive again.

295
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,200
 "He was lost and is now found."

296
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,400
 So they began to celebrate.

297
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,640
 The father is overjoyed to see the son again.

298
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,200
 He doesn't wait for the son to make it all the way back.

299
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,400
 He says, while he was a long way off,

300
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,360
 the father sprints toward him.

301
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,120
 The son's not even close to being home yet.

302
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,720
 The father doesn't even meet him halfway.

303
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,740
 This idea that God's gonna meet us halfway

304
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,580
 is not biblical, right?

305
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,840
 Like God goes the whole way.

306
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,800
 Like the son is all the way over there

307
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,640
 and the father sees that he's turned around

308
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,040
 and is coming back and he runs towards him

309
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,880
 in compassion, overjoyed about this.

310
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,200
 And I think it gets me, what gets me is

311
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,240
 when I try to visualize how beautiful this is.

312
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,600
 I think about my three-year-old son

313
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,200
 and how if there was a moment where he's coming to me,

314
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,320
 we used to live in Chonquano

315
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,980
 and I used to get home from work late

316
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,920
 and it'd be around maybe like seven or something

317
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,840
 and my wife would leave our estate

318
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,240
 and start walking towards us and I'd be walking home.

319
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,100
 And the second I saw my son,

320
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,280
 I mean, I didn't physically run

321
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,200
 because it's hot in Hong Kong, but my heart ran.

322
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,880
 I was thrilled, I was so excited.

323
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,040
 I could only imagine, you know,

324
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,360
 when I've not seen my son for a whole day,

325
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,080
 this dude's son has been in a different country.

326
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,640
 The condition and the appearance of the son is saddening,

327
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,480
 probably breaks his heart.

328
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,680
 So it probably pushes him even more into that moment.

329
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,660
 But the father runs to him, drops everything

330
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,620
 and is filled with compassion to see his boy again.

331
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,780
 This is a decisive and aggressive, fervent love.

332
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,660
 It's extreme grace.

333
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,180
 And it's extreme grace because note this,

334
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,300
 the father could have just forgiven him.

335
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,620
 This would have been a beautiful parable

336
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,140
 if it was about how a son really messed up.

337
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,080
 I mean, as bad as it gets and he gets what he deserves.

338
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,440
 And when he comes and tries to apologize,

339
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,380
 the father says, "Okay, you're forgiven."

340
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,260
 And that's the end of the parable.

341
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,580
 If that was the story,

342
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,020
 that would be a pretty powerful parable.

343
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,220
 But it doesn't just stop there.

344
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,180
 The father's love is so extreme.

345
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,180
 It's so extreme that the son tries to get out his phrase,

346
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,580
 "Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you.

347
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,500
 I'm no longer worried."

348
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,140
 And I imagine the father just putting his hand

349
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,320
 to his son's mouth, saying, "Stop, you're my son.

350
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,260
 You're here, that's what matters."

351
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,100
 And the father doesn't just forgive him.

352
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
 The father reinstates him.

353
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,740
 Rather than saying, "All is forgiven.

354
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,380
 Your slate is clean."

355
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,700
 The father says, "Go get the best stuff we have.

356
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,420
 Get the best robe," he says.

357
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,100
 "Get a ring, get a sandal, kill the A5 Wagyu."

358
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,660
 Like he wants the good stuff for his son

359
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,180
 who has just done all this mess.

360
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,640
 He does not just forgive us, he reinstates.

361
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,140
 And I think we have to come to the understanding

362
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,780
 that this is God's posture.

363
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,280
 This is the father's posture to us as well.

364
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,560
 Can we talk about how,

365
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,340
 if I put myself in the position of the son,

366
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,100
 forgiveness would have been great.

367
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,100
 But I wonder how he felt when his dad hugged him

368
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,420
 in that moment.

369
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,740
 I wonder what he felt when he's dirty and stinky

370
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,860
 and smelly and tired and exhausted and not worthy,

371
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,860
 yet his father throws his arms around him.

372
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,780
 Talk about getting more than you deserve.

373
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,060
 I feel like that motion probably,

374
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,060
 that moment probably flooded him with plenty of emotion

375
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,800
 to be received again.

376
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,680
 See, the father had no intention

377
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,780
 of making a repentant son a slave.

378
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,980
 And I think we have to hear that

379
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,140
 for what it's really saying.

380
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,760
 Our father has no intention

381
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,260
 of making a repentant us a slave,

382
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,020
 but rather in his great joy,

383
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,500
 he restores us back to sonship and daughtership.

384
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,020
 It is joy that he does it.

385
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,460
 It's not because he has to,

386
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,540
 because he's God, because he's obligated.

387
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,540
 It's within his joy.

388
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,420
 If you don't believe me,

389
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,780
 three different times it says it.

390
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,620
 In the first parable about the sheep,

391
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,820
 it says this, at the very end of it,

392
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,480
 he goes, "Rejoice with me, I have found my lost sheep."

393
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,900
 When the parable gets to the next part about the coin,

394
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,480
 the woman says, "Rejoice with me, I have found my lost coin."

395
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,060
 When it gets to the son for the third time,

396
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,780
 "Rejoice and celebrate, be glad."

397
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,520
 There is joy that God feels about restoring you.

398
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,240
 When you come back, it is in his joy to bring you,

399
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,860
 not just to forgive you, but to reinstate you,

400
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,160
 to bring you into the family of God.

401
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,480
 Because in that space,

402
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,980
 there is a relationship that is restored.

403
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,820
 In that space, there is hope,

404
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,700
 there is meaning, there is identity.

405
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,080
 He wants to provide all of that for us.

406
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,340
 This restored identity is a theme

407
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,980
 that we cannot afford to overlook.

408
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,540
 There's something to be said about how identity

409
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,660
 and relationship are major threads into this story,

410
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,580
 and into the kingdom of God as a whole.

411
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,220
 I think that's why this story is drenched

412
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,700
 with identity imagery.

413
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,580
 Did you notice how every main character

414
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,820
 isn't referred to by their name, or by their job?

415
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,340
 It's the father, it's the son, it's the other son.

416
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,700
 Right, like who they are communicated as

417
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,080
 is based off of relationship.

418
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,780
 Relationship is so important.

419
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,260
 It elevates the meaning of this parable.

420
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,420
 Let me think about it this way.

421
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,740
 What if this parable wasn't called the prodigal son?

422
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,840
 What if it was called the prodigal friend?

423
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,780
 So you guys know Jethro, who leads worship here,

424
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,660
 stunning young man with the guitar.

425
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,180
 He's a good friend of mine.

426
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,060
 If Jethro took my money and went to Indonesia,

427
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,420
 I love you Jethro, and spent it all,

428
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,620
 and got what he deserved, lost his money,

429
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,380
 and is eating pig food, comes back to Hong Kong,

430
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,420
 and is like, "Bro, I'm sorry."

431
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,820
 Okay, well, first of all, I'm a pastor,

432
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,900
 so I'm gonna say, "Yes, Jethro, I forgive you."

433
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,400
 Right, that's what pastors and Christians do.

434
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,460
 But if my son, Elias, made the same mistake,

435
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,420
 hear this, it would hurt significantly more.

436
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,540
 It really would, it would tear me apart.

437
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,580
 But if he came back, that joy would be ridiculous.

438
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,700
 And I would not stop at saying, "You're forgiven, son.

439
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,540
 "Now go do your thing.

440
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,860
 "You're forgiven, come be a servant."

441
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,820
 No, I would throw my arms around him,

442
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,820
 'cause he's my boy, 'cause he's my kid, he's me.

443
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,140
 Right, and I think if you understand this story,

444
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,100
 and you understand the power of family,

445
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,660
 that's what Jesus is talking about.

446
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,180
 It's not just about the forgiveness of the sin,

447
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,660
 it's about the ultimate goal being restoring us

448
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,420
 into the right identity.

449
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,020
 The scriptures talk about this all over the place.

450
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,900
 Why do you think it is that we're called sons and daughters

451
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,420
 of God, children of God?

452
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,820
 When Jesus would teach the disciples to pray,

453
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,940
 which I find very fascinating,

454
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,660
 the one thing they tell him is, "Teach us this."

455
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,740
 They could ask him, "Teach us anything."

456
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,260
 He says, "Teach us how to pray."

457
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,660
 So Jesus says, "Okay, fine, I'll teach you how to pray."

458
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,300
 At that time, their posture towards divinity

459
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,900
 was that God is holy, God is Yahweh,

460
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,840
 you know, we gotta be careful,

461
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,980
 make sure we don't sin too much,

462
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,260
 like go through all these rituals.

463
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,660
 He says, "When you pray, pray like this."

464
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,860
 Our father, relationship.

465
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,740
 Not our extreme maker who is bigger than everything

466
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,620
 or Elohim or our father.

467
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,900
 There is something so significant

468
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,100
 in this relationship identity concept

469
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,540
 that the scripture wants us to understand

470
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,700
 and it's because of this.

471
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,700
 As children of God, we get certain perks.

472
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,080
 There are things that happen within the family

473
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,460
 that won't happen outside the family.

474
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,220
 The way I love my son would be inappropriate

475
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,060
 for me to love any other person that way.

476
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,420
 The way I love my spouse or my daughter

477
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,260
 would be very different

478
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,780
 than the way I'm gonna love my friends

479
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,300
 or the way I'm gonna engage with my friends.

480
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,620
 See, when you're in the family, there's something different.

481
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,380
 There's a grace that's for the family,

482
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,380
 there's a certain compassion that's for the family.

483
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,100
 The family deeply matters.

484
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,180
 I think about how my son, although he's three,

485
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,820
 and let me just say, I overestimated three, y'all.

486
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,400
 He is, whew, he's perfect, but man, I'm stressing.

487
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,520
 He does a lot of stuff and I can never,

488
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,480
 I can't think of a reason that I would never love him.

489
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,520
 Like, I would love him no matter what.

490
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,600
 Like, he's great, but he's three, but he's great.

491
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,440
 But then there's you guys who, I like you,

492
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,520
 but I'm sure there are things you can do

493
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,820
 to make me stop liking you real quick.

494
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,200
 All right, some of you don't have to try that hard.

495
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
 It's pretty easy for some.

496
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,200
 But not with my kid, not with my family.

497
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,560
 And God has this posture towards us.

498
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,700
 That's why the ultimate blessing,

499
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,200
 the ultimate thing we can receive is not a gift,

500
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,860
 a Ferrari or a better job

501
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,720
 or a more stable relationship at home.

502
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,200
 The ultimate gift we can get

503
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,960
 is to be brought back into his family.

504
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,300
 That's what Emma was talking about.

505
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,500
 By the blood of Jesus, we're not just forgiven,

506
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,620
 we're brought into his family.

507
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,620
 This is how God intended humanity to be,

508
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,160
 in relationship with him, heirs of his,

509
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,100
 made to be like him, protected by him, his children.

510
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,740
 This is why Jesus in John three

511
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,240
 would speak to Nicodemus at night and he would say,

512
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,000
 "You must be, you must be born again.

513
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,340
 "You must be born into this family

514
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,060
 "because if you are in this family,

515
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,140
 "there is no sin that is deep enough

516
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,860
 "to separate me from you.

517
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,820
 "When you're mine, you're mine,

518
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,560
 "and I will go through anything to get you back."

519
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,660
 And this story ultimately is illustrating

520
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,880
 that exact thing, the perks that come

521
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,960
 with being sons and daughters of God.

522
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,920
 By repenting of our sins, by turning from our wrongdoings,

523
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,820
 as a child of God, know that you have access

524
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,820
 to the most extreme grace that there is.

525
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,960
 Now, we've talked about two characters.

526
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,440
 We've first looked at the crazy son,

527
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,120
 we've looked at the father and the grace

528
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,400
 that is just flowing from him.

529
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,440
 But there's a third character that we cannot overlook,

530
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
 and the only way to really understand him

531
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,880
 is to understand the context of this parable.

532
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,840
 This parable is something that maybe is good for all of us

533
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,840
 in our basic Bible reading and scripture studying.

534
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,800
 It's always good to ask ourselves,

535
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,440
 "How did we get to this point?"

536
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,680
 Jesus might say something wild.

537
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,000
 Ask yourself, "What made him say that?"

538
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,720
 I think if we ask ourselves this question in this parable,

539
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,080
 "Why is Jesus telling a parable about sons?

540
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,140
 "What is he responding to?

541
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,320
 "What is making him tell this story?"

542
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,080
 If you look at Luke chapter 15 at verse two,

543
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,480
 you get this context of the Pharisees,

544
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,320
 who are the religious leaders of the day,

545
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,880
 the tax collectors and sinners,

546
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,520
 you know, the degenerates, the worst of society,

547
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,000
 all gather together around to hear Jesus.

548
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,660
 And the Pharisees, the teachers of the law,

549
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,440
 they muttered, so not intended to be heard,

550
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,120
 to one another, they say this,

551
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,780
 "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."

552
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,460
 This is our context.

553
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,720
 The fact that Jesus, the one who does the big miracles,

554
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,640
 the one claiming to be the way, the truth and the life,

555
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,760
 this holy man, is spending his time

556
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,460
 with the worst of society.

557
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,040
 What's this guy really thinking?

558
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,700
 Like, can you be God and spend time with such filthy people?

559
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,080
 With the worst people, the cheaters, the liars,

560
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,440
 the prostitutes, the tax collectors, the thieves,

561
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,520
 the worst that society has to offer,

562
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,620
 yet Jesus is sharing meals, spending his time with them.

563
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,040
 So they say something about it.

564
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,320
 They don't have the courage to say it to Jesus,

565
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,480
 so they say it to one another.

566
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,560
 They mutter it.

567
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,960
 This man is hanging out with the worst people.

568
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,640
 And in response to that, Jesus hears it.

569
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,880
 He knows their heart.

570
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,480
 In response to that, he tells them

571
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,840
 this trilogy of parables about coins, about sheep,

572
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,680
 and then ends with the big one about family,

573
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,600
 about the sons.

574
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,620
 And I think it's interesting that this ending,

575
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,280
 the story that he tells, it talks about a father,

576
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,800
 it talks about the degenerate, it talks about the holy.

577
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,040
 That's what the parable's about, right?

578
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,000
 The son, the father, and another son.

579
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,580
 The people in this room, there's Jesus,

580
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,480
 who claims to be God, the father.

581
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
 There's the holy ones, the Pharisees,

582
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,040
 who know all the laws, who do everything right.

583
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,860
 And then there's the tax collectors and the sinners.

584
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,360
 See, there's a lesson Jesus wants us to see.

585
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,480
 He's using this story to tell the Pharisees

586
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,760
 and the sinners about how God sees sinners.

587
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
 So that's something we can't afford to miss in this.

588
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,240
 How does God see the sinner?

589
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,720
 When he's telling this story,

590
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,320
 I imagine that the crowd is expecting

591
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,200
 that if this son did this much damage,

592
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,280
 he takes his dad money and runs off.

593
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,600
 When he comes back, they're probably expecting

594
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,960
 he's probably not gonna get brought back into the family.

595
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,520
 He's gonna get rebuked.

596
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,340
 He's gonna get told off, get scolded.

597
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,300
 Maybe lectured.

598
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,440
 But Jesus is clever with his wording.

599
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,280
 Jesus says that the father welcomes the son.

600
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,020
 Well, what's the first accusation

601
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,120
 about what Jesus is doing in that moment?

602
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,000
 Back in chapter two, or in verse two.

603
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,320
 It says that they're annoyed and frustrated.

604
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,980
 This man welcomes and eats with sinners.

605
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,240
 In the story that Jesus tells, what happens?

606
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,800
 The father, this great man, welcomes back his son,

607
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,480
 puts the clothes and puts the robe

608
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,340
 and brings him back into the house,

609
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,240
 and then he does what?

610
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,540
 He takes them to lavash and they have a meal, right?

611
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,560
 They kill the fattened cow.

612
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,720
 He welcomes and he eats in the story and in the accusation.

613
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,600
 Jesus is being direct in story form.

614
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,040
 He's providing groundbreaking revelation,

615
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,760
 making it clear that God is not just our creator.

616
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,640
 He's not just powerful Yahweh, but he's father.

617
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,400
 And how does he see the sinner?

618
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,440
 How does the father see the sinner?

619
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,700
 Well, this is where it's key.

620
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,600
 For the sinner who will come to their senses

621
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,440
 and will recognize their sin,

622
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,020
 and who will just attempt to make his way back home,

623
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,420
 how does the father respond?

624
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:44,360
 With ridiculous grace, with extreme grace,

625
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,760
 going way beyond what you need, what you want,

626
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,680
 beyond forgiveness into restoration,

627
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,280
 he brings you back in.

628
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,260
 Jesus tells this parable so that they would understand

629
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,840
 that if God comes down to earth,

630
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,200
 he's not hanging out with the holy people.

631
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,720
 When God comes down to earth, he's going for the lost.

632
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,400
 He's spending his time with those who are broken,

633
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,280
 those who are vulnerable.

634
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,120
 He's not gonna be concerned about maintaining his privilege

635
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,720
 or his status as God.

636
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,120
 He's gonna be with those who are broken.

637
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,280
 And if you think that God only cares for you

638
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,720
 if you do a good job with those who are within the church

639
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,120
 or those who have it right,

640
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,280
 then you might know the rules of God,

641
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
 but you don't know his heart.

642
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,280
 That's what Jesus is saying in this parable.

643
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,360
 It becomes so clear that the religious leaders,

644
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,460
 they don't actually know the father at all,

645
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,800
 'cause they couldn't be more wrong

646
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,640
 about how he would respond, right?

647
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,800
 And this is why, because they are the religious leaders.

648
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,000
 They set the climate, the temperature of what it means

649
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,520
 to be a follower of Yahweh, to have good spirituality.

650
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,560
 And it's clear from this that they don't even know

651
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,840
 the father, right?

652
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,300
 Because they would see it as,

653
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,760
 well, we're Pharisees, these are sinners.

654
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,280
 It would say in the Gospel of Matthew

655
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,800
 that Pharisees were very concerned about their status,

656
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,440
 about being upright, about, you know,

657
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,400
 they would dress a certain way.

658
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,520
 When they went outside the streets,

659
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,360
 they would pray in a certain voice,

660
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,400
 pretty loud to be heard.

661
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,680
 When they fasted, they were a bit dramatic about it,

662
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,400
 you know, like soccer players and flopping.

663
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,720
 They were like, oh, I'm fasting,

664
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,560
 making sure everyone knew that, you know,

665
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,280
 they were all about the image and the appearance.

666
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,360
 Well, Jesus is contrasting himself with them,

667
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,900
 because just like the Pharisees,

668
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,560
 Jesus sees that these are tax collectors.

669
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,840
 He knows.

670
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,600
 He knows that Matthew was cheating people from their money.

671
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,520
 He knew about Zechariah's problem.

672
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,120
 He knows that they're prostitutes.

673
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,680
 He knows their sin.

674
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,520
 Think back to John 4, the woman at the well.

675
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,520
 He knows that she has multiple husbands, right?

676
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,360
 But what does he do?

677
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,780
 His privilege of being God

678
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,880
 does not stop him from coming close.

679
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,720
 Hear that.

680
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,960
 Because he's God doesn't mean

681
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,740
 he won't come close to our mess.

682
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,940
 Jesus would spin this story around

683
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,640
 telling of a prodigal son

684
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,920
 and telling of the position of our attitudes

685
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,060
 and the attitude of the older brother

686
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:08,060
 as being most clearly reflected in that of the Pharisees,

687
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,280
 who are, get this, it kind of,

688
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,480
 just when you think about it like this, it drives me,

689
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,060
 the Pharisees are holding Jesus's compassion against him.

690
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,600
 That's a hard way to look at it.

691
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,800
 Because he's so compassionate, they're angry.

692
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,380
 And this is exactly what you see in that final brother,

693
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,220
 that last kid.

694
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,620
 That's why you have to know the context.

695
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,480
 Because of Jesus's compassion, they're angry.

696
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,560
 Well, look at that older brother, what happens with him?

697
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,960
 He's angry that the younger brother

698
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,320
 who's been reckless and wild,

699
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,520
 whose life has been falling apart,

700
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,240
 comes back home and the father throws his arms over him,

701
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,680
 gives him all this stuff, gives him the fatted calf,

702
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,860
 celebrates and is rejoicing with him.

703
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:52,680
 The older son and the Pharisees share the same perspective.

704
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,000
 And as I studied this,

705
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,080
 I knew there were a lot of obvious points to make,

706
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,120
 but there was something that hit me for the first time.

707
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,080
 So the way the story goes is that the younger brother,

708
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
 when he gets what he wants from dad,

709
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,800
 he runs to a different land, right?

710
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,180
 He goes far, far away, like Jethro going far away.

711
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,240
 The older brother says that,

712
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,640
 "I stayed in your house the whole time.

713
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,480
 "I was close to you.

714
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,440
 "I was always obeying you, doing exactly what you wanted."

715
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,680
 So how then does the older brother

716
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,760
 who has stayed close to the father

717
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,840
 know the details of the sin of the younger brother?

718
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,920
 The younger brother was in a distant land.

719
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,000
 The older brother stayed close to dad.

720
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,840
 It's extra to say that, right?

721
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,920
 I've stayed close to you,

722
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,560
 I've done what you're supposed to do.

723
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,840
 How does he know what the brother has done?

724
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,000
 Has he hired a spy?

725
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,640
 Does he have a scouting report on what his brother's doing?

726
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,800
 How is he aware?

727
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,960
 I mean, because you would think that to be

728
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,880
 in the father's house, your focus would be on the father.

729
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,440
 Hear that?

730
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,920
 See, the older brother is more focused on gathering

731
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,120
 a report of what the younger brother has done wrong.

732
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,360
 He has, maybe he's remained in the house,

733
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,960
 but he has not abided in the father

734
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,000
 because the father is compassionate,

735
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,480
 whereas the older brother is judgmental.

736
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,000
 While in the father's house,

737
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,740
 focused on the wrongdoings of others.

738
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,680
 This is the heart of the Pharisees.

739
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,880
 This is the way that they naturally found themselves.

740
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,400
 But I think we have to be careful

741
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,320
 because sometimes this can be us.

742
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,960
 This could be you and me sitting in this room.

743
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,680
 I think we have to ask ourselves these questions regularly.

744
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,120
 Are we becoming more like Christ and his love

745
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,160
 for the broken, for the worst of humanity,

746
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,440
 or becoming more self-righteous?

747
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,800
 Do we just wanna see them get what they deserve?

748
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,360
 Before we dismiss it quickly,

749
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,600
 because no one likes the title of self-righteousness,

750
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,280
 remember this, the Pharisees had all the laws memorized.

751
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,120
 They did it all right.

752
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,520
 They were the ones who prayed with the best words,

753
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,080
 and they were the ones who fasted regularly,

754
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,280
 and they had memorized the first five books of the Bible.

755
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
 I mean, they got it, they understood it.

756
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,800
 They were like the pastors of the day.

757
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,840
 I think we could come in every Sunday

758
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,720
 and we can raise our hands during worship

759
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,920
 or clap when Emma starts talking about the blood of Jesus.

760
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,780
 You know, amen.

761
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,320
 We can take our phones out and take a photo

762
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,080
 when there's a tweetable line in the sermon,

763
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,840
 but does that mean anything?

764
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,720
 Because that's not the indicator

765
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,120
 of the transition that we have to be going through,

766
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,120
 of the transformation that God really intends

767
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,440
 for those of us who remain here with him.

768
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,160
 To be offended by God's heart for the lost.

769
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,360
 This is their attitude even though they do everything right.

770
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,840
 And I think we gotta be careful to make sure

771
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,360
 that just because we come, we don't end up in that place

772
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,160
 looking at, oh, God, I've done all these things

773
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,400
 and they've done nothing.

774
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,720
 We don't wanna be those kinds of people.

775
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,360
 I don't want us to be those kinds of people.

776
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,440
 Our proximity to Christ isn't a badge we wear

777
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,400
 that makes us better than other people.

778
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,720
 It's not.

779
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,800
 It's not our permission to point and say,

780
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,620
 look how bad they're doing.

781
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,320
 Doesn't give us a right to get online

782
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,860
 and blast everyone that's not a Christian

783
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,640
 for the ridiculous things that they might do.

784
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,480
 Guess what?

785
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,400
 They're not Christians.

786
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,240
 Imagine that.

787
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,240
 No, our proximity to God is meant to draw us close to him

788
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,360
 so that we can be transformed by him.

789
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,000
 Being close to God is less about being holier than others.

790
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,240
 It's more about becoming like him,

791
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,920
 becoming extreme in our grace,

792
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,400
 choosing compassion over judgment,

793
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,800
 oozing with compassion when our brothers and sisters

794
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,000
 are lost, being excited to see them come home,

795
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,620
 co-laboring with the Father.

796
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,800
 That's my heart for me, my family.

797
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,840
 That's my heart for us as a community.

798
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,600
 That in our weekly gatherings,

799
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,560
 in the gatherings that take place outside of Sundays here,

800
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,480
 that we would be growing in our likeness of God.

801
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,800
 That our hearts would be becoming softer

802
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,280
 and being more like his.

803
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,000
 That he would replace the heart of stone

804
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,040
 and give us a heart of flesh.

805
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,280
 That he would wipe away the scales from our eyes

806
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,500
 and we would see people the way that he sees them,

807
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,000
 being shaped like him.

808
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,280
 That we would be broken for the lost

809
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,200
 the way that he's broken for the lost.

810
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,080
 That we would rejoice when they come home.

811
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,760
 We would rejoice when they repent.

812
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,880
 And for me, where I find this most challenging,

813
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,320
 I have to ask myself this,

814
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,320
 would I be rejoicing, celebrating,

815
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,520
 in the worst person that I know,

816
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,320
 most filthy person that I know,

817
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,540
 the liar, the cheater,

818
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,760
 the one who's weaseled their way,

819
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,880
 who's offended me,

820
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,160
 comes into God's family,

821
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,460
 and he gets the exact same privilege as I do.

822
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,600
 Can I celebrate at that?

823
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,680
 Because I think it's that what drives the son crazy,

824
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,160
 it's not just that he's forgiven,

825
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,200
 it's that he's now restored to the same level.

826
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,840
 And that blood of Jesus, like Emma said,

827
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,920
 that is our ultimate equalizer.

828
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,320
 That's what makes us all be able to be

829
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,040
 on the same level again.

830
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,280
 And that's what the father is ultimately showing us

831
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
 through all of this.

832
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,240
 Now, with all this repentance and grace,

833
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,900
 I think there's one last question

834
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,520
 that I want us to kind of wrestle with a little bit

835
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,880
 before we get to a closing point.

836
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,880
 See, what do you think those who were sinning,

837
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,240
 those who were the sinners,

838
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,460
 Jesus was having dinner with them, right?

839
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,000
 What do you think they were thinking?

840
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,760
 How do you think they felt when the holy teacher, Jesus,

841
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,960
 talks about God welcoming sinners?

842
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,800
 What do you think their feelings were in that moment?

843
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,880
 Because they would be well acquainted with their sins,

844
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,980
 they know where they've fallen short.

845
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,940
 I wonder if when they hear that the father welcomes back,

846
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,740
 kills the shattered calf,

847
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,980
 puts the ring on the arm, on the finger,

848
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,100
 I wonder if maybe goosebumps happened, you know?

849
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,340
 I wonder if like, they might have gotten choked up

850
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,560
 a little bit, maybe a lump in their throat,

851
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,980
 maybe a little heavy breathing.

852
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,660
 Because to know that God is going to respond

853
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,400
 with such grace if we repent can be liberating.

854
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,460
 It can lead us to actual repentance.

855
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,500
 I think this is what Jesus is trying to show us

856
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,020
 with this whole story.

857
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,400
 Could it be that by learning of the father's posture

858
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,300
 for restoring those who are lost,

859
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,700
 some of their hearts are softened?

860
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,680
 Could that be the same for us?

861
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,140
 That if you ask yourself this,

862
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,940
 if you could really understand

863
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,500
 that no matter what it is that you've done,

864
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,300
 it doesn't matter how bad it is, I mean, the worst thing,

865
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,880
 if you were to have a come to your senses moment,

866
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,980
 if we were just to turn,

867
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,500
 remember, you don't have to have it all right yet,

868
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,260
 if we were just to start that journey back home,

869
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,980
 the father doesn't just say, good job,

870
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,540
 thanks for not sinning anymore.

871
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,500
 He rejoices, like joy, happiness, celebration,

872
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,580
 let's throw a party, that's his response.

873
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,860
 The scriptures would say that the angels in heaven

874
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,560
 are celebrating over this.

875
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,740
 I wonder if we could get that.

876
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,380
 How would that impact our desire

877
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,380
 or our courage to actually repent?

878
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:08,700
 Oftentimes, repentance is seen as this doom and gloom thing,

879
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,180
 but this shows us that repentance

880
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,700
 is something that's met with joy.

881
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,660
 We don't have to be all serious and sad when we repent.

882
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,220
 We come back to God and he's excited to have us.

883
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,980
 He loves us, overflowing with joy.

884
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,660
 If we understand that repentance is a joyful moment,

885
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,660
 would we dare repent more?

886
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,460
 Could it be something that we would do regularly?

887
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,220
 'Cause here's the thing, this is what Satan's trying to do.

888
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,580
 Here's the big picture.

889
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,340
 Go back to Genesis for a second.

890
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,600
 When Adam and Eve sin in the garden,

891
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,060
 they take the bite of the apple,

892
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,860
 they recognize that they're naked, and what do they do?

893
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,580
 They hide.

894
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,380
 They distance themselves.

895
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,200
 They separate, sin separates us from God,

896
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,420
 but this is what grace does.

897
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,620
 Grace says that if you would come to your senses,

898
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,420
 if you would put your faith in Jesus,

899
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,180
 if you would understand that he is the way,

900
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,100
 the truth, and the life,

901
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,580
 if you would just make an effort to come towards him,

902
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,260
 you don't have to get it all right,

903
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,560
 but if you would just take a step, he'll meet you.

904
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,580
 He'll sprint towards you, and he will be so glad,

905
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,620
 not just to forgive,

906
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,900
 but to make you a part of the family again,

907
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,720
 to make you an heir, someone who gets things from him,

908
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,000
 someone who is loved by him,

909
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,400
 someone who is protected by him, taken care of by him.

910
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,040
 Guys, I pray this is something that we can understand

911
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,880
 and fully get.

912
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,480
 I pray that the courage needed

913
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,900
 from an understanding of the extreme grace of the Father

914
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,720
 would find its way to you,

915
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,600
 because repentance is a bit of an invitation.

916
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,040
 It's God making it clear that you're welcomed back

917
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,760
 and you're wanted back.

918
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,280
 So I think we all need to keep this in mind.

919
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,640
 You're wanted.

920
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,000
 God wants you in his family.

921
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,320
 If he didn't, he would just forgive you

922
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,600
 and let you on your way.

923
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,120
 But he wants you to be a part of that family.

924
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,960
 He wants you to be under that covering,

925
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,240
 under that protection.

926
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,960
 He desires to see you not just forgiven of your sin.

927
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,000
 John 3:16, "For God so hated sin

928
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,840
 "that he came into the world."

929
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,720
 No, for God so loved the world.

930
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,260
 His posture is love towards you.

931
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,580
 He desires to see you flourish, to see you at peace,

932
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,260
 to see you the way that he's intended your life to be.

933
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:27,540
 And that takes place when we're able to turn from our sins.

934
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,100
 Here, I wanna leave us with this.

935
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,580
 As the worship team makes their way up,

936
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,260
 there is one of my favorite C.S. Lewis quotes.

937
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,780
 And if you don't know who C.S. Lewis is,

938
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,060
 the 90th series is incredible.

939
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,020
 Please read it.

940
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,820
 It'll enrich your life.

941
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,560
 But Lewis, in one of his books called "The Screwtape Letters,"

942
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,120
 which is a book where demons are writing letters

943
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,000
 to Satan about people.

944
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,220
 Very wild, very crazy, but very insightful.

945
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,360
 This one demon is writing.

946
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,360
 And he says this about the human effort,

947
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,600
 about the divine satisfaction and love.

948
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,760
 And it is profound and it blows my mind.

949
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,800
 And it stays with me.

950
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
 I've written songs about it.

951
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,360
 I've talked about it like all the time.

952
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,940
 I wanna leave you guys with it

953
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,000
 'cause I hope it can help you.

954
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,760
 It says this, "He," meaning the father,

955
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,240
 "He wants them," meaning us,

956
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,000
 "He wants them to learn how to walk

957
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,720
 "and must therefore take away his hands.

958
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,100
 "And if only the will to walk is really there,

959
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,920
 "he is pleased," get this, "even in their stumbles."

960
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,680
 Guys, for lots of us, it won't be a clean walk home.

961
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,280
 For lots of us, it will be stumbles.

962
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,700
 It's not an easy route back,

963
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,460
 but here's the thing, the heavy lifting is done by him.

964
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,560
 He's gonna carry you through.

965
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,780
 He's your strength.

966
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,800
 He is a rock that you build your hope on.

967
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,240
 He is your strong tower.

968
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,440
 He is your ever-present help in times of need

969
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,040
 and in times where you don't realize that you have need.

970
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,400
 Even in our stumbles, he will be pleased

971
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,600
 and he will be with us.

972
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,540
 So God, we come to you this morning

973
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,540
 and we recognize and are overwhelmed by your grace,

974
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,180
 by your extreme fervent love,

975
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,180
 by love so extreme that it welcomes in the center.

976
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,740
 It welcomes in those of us who are Christians

977
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,180
 and who have made such terrible mistakes

978
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,460
 that we're afraid to come to you.

979
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,100
 It welcomes, it dines with, it reinstates,

980
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,580
 and it restores us.

981
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,160
 So Holy Spirit, there are so many lies

982
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,160
 and so many fears about being judged by God,

983
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,240
 but to the one who would return,

984
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:05,900
 there is this truth that your love should cast out our fear,

985
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,140
 that your love is enough,

986
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,280
 that the blood of Jesus runs deeper

987
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,740
 than anything your child or children could do.

988
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,280
 And so God, help us not just believe it,

989
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,620
 but Holy Spirit, would you put that as a seed into our heart

990
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,060
 and would you keep that soil fertile so this grows in us

991
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,100
 into a tree of understanding that you want us

992
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,180
 and you welcome us.

993
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,300
 And no matter what we've done,

994
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,200
 if the thief on the cross could get in at the last minute,

995
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,500
 it doesn't matter what we've done,

996
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,800
 if we would turn to you,

997
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,540
 we will find hope,

998
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,620
 we will find a father who isn't waiting to beat us,

999
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,900
 but who is overjoyed.

1000
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,060
 God, for those of us who feel distant,

1001
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,260
 who feel like we can't talk to you

1002
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,340
 'cause our sin is so bad,

1003
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,360
 I rebuke that lie.

1004
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,480
 Holy Spirit, would you come in and speak your truth?

1005
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,700
 Would you remind that light shines best in darkness,

1006
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,060
 that you came not to be served,

1007
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,980
 but to serve us, that those of us who were sick,

1008
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,880
 those of us who were in need of you,

1009
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,580
 that's who you came for.

1010
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,860
 Lord, would you open our hearts,

1011
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,540
 lead us to that coming to our senses moment

1012
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,380
 and give us the courage to turn our hearts,

1013
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,000
 our minds, our postures and our will back to you.

1014
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,740
 In Jesus' name, amen.
