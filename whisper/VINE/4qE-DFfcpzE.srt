1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,380
 When I was in seminary to study to be a pastor, there was a season where I realized that I

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,000
 didn't worship God very much.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
 It was actually quite shocking.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,880
 Now, I didn't do that intentionally, and for the longest time I wasn't even aware of it.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,180
 But one day I had an assignment in one of my classes, and the assignment was to jot

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,620
 down key moments of my spiritual journey.

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:44,120
 And so I sat in my room, I started reflecting on all that God had done, and I started writing.

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:52,900
 And as I was doing that, I was suddenly overcome with a deep sense of awe and gratitude of

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,600
 God's work in my life.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,280
 And as I was looking back, it was amazing to see how God had provided for me, and how

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,540
 He had guided me, and how He blessed me every step of the way.

12
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:14,760
 And as I was sitting in that room by myself, tears started filling my eyes, and I started

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,580
 praising God and telling Him how thankful and grateful I was for what He has done in

14
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,340
 my life.

15
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:33,440
 Now, this was significant for me because I had been going through a dry season.

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,460
 I'm sure you can relate to that.

17
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,140
 We all go through them sometimes.

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:43,780
 But the Holy Spirit worked through that exercise in the class, and He renewed me, and He gave

19
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,900
 me the desire to worship God again.

20
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,340
 And it was powerful.

21
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,660
 Now, I don't know about you, but for me, and even to this day, I have different seasons

22
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,540
 in my life of praising and worshiping God.

23
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:05,300
 There's times when I praise God a lot, and where it just flows out of my heart, and where

24
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,300
 it's very clear as to who God is and what He's doing in my life.

25
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:17,500
 And then there's other times where there's only praise, it's very sparse, it's far and

26
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,380
 in between.

27
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,180
 But here's the thing, we always have reason to praise God.

28
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,340
 Now, maybe we're going through difficult things, but even in those difficult moments, we have

29
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,580
 reason to praise God.

30
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,580
 Now, perhaps we're not thanking God for the trials or the challenges that we're facing,

31
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,980
 but nonetheless, God is good, and there's things that we can praise Him for, and He

32
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,860
 is worthy of our praise.

33
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,620
 He's worthy of it.

34
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:54,460
 And so today, as we're coming to this final message in a Summer Psalms series, I want

35
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:00,980
 to reflect with you together on where are you on your spiritual journey right now when

36
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,660
 it comes to praising and worshiping God.

37
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:11,020
 Are you right now in a season where there's very little praise, and it's been difficult,

38
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,300
 and it's been hard to praise God?

39
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,900
 Or are you in a season where the praises are coming easily off your lips?

40
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,180
 And so we're going to look at Psalm 66, and as we walk through the Psalms, we're going

41
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,460
 to look at two things.

42
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,420
 One, what does it say about why do we worship God?

43
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,380
 Why do we do that?

44
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:44,580
 And then secondly, how is the Psalm inviting us to renew our desire to worship God again,

45
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,620
 and perhaps in a deeper and in a new way?

46
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,540
 So we're going to walk through the Psalm section by section.

47
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,060
 We're actually going to look at the whole Psalm, and so let's start in verses 1 through

48
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,060
 4.

49
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,940
 It says, "Shout for joy to the God of the earth.

50
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,220
 Sing the glory of his name.

51
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,420
 Give to him glorious praise.

52
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,840
 Say to God, 'How awesome are your deeds!

53
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,500
 So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you.

54
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,060
 All the earth worships you and sings praise to you.

55
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,380
 They sing praise to your name."

56
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,580
 So our Psalm is a call.

57
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:41,140
 It actually literally calls us to shout our praises to God.

58
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,580
 And it also tells us about what our praises are supposed to be like.

59
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,460
 They're not supposed to be mediocre.

60
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:59,420
 They're not supposed to be half-hearted.

61
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,100
 Verse 2 tells us, "Sing the glory of his name.

62
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,460
 Give to him glorious praise."

63
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,580
 And what that means is our praise needs to match the person that we're worshiping.

64
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,780
 God is, and his works that he does in our lives, they're majestic, they're awesome,

65
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,860
 they're amazing.

66
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,900
 And so our praise needs to reflect that.

67
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,740
 Just think of a band performing or an orchestra performing.

68
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,560
 If the performance is poor, you know, people are like, "Nah."

69
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,240
 But if they do an incredible job, you know, we're so moved and we cannot help ourselves

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,860
 to clap and to cheer.

71
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,940
 And if it's appropriate in that setting, we might even cheer, "Encore, encore, encore."

72
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,700
 We want more because it's so amazing.

73
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:55,380
 Now, in a similar way, our worship and praise needs to match who God is.

74
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,980
 It's the only appropriate thing.

75
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,460
 God is our creator.

76
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,580
 He's our provider.

77
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,380
 He's the one that loves us, that takes care of us.

78
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,380
 He's also a redeemer.

79
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,940
 Earlier, we celebrated communion.

80
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:20,100
 We remember what Jesus has done for our sake.

81
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:29,660
 They don't have life on the cross, so we can be forgiven and have new life in him.

82
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:38,780
 So our praise needs to be fitting of who God is.

83
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,660
 But in verse 3, we're actually given a little bit more instruction on what do we actually

84
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,020
 say in our praise and worship.

85
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,980
 It says, "Say to God, 'How awesome are your deeds!

86
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,900
 So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you.'"

87
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:03,660
 We're told that we praise God for his works, for what he does, and we tell God what he

88
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,660
 does.

89
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,060
 That's part of our praise.

90
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,620
 We tell God what he has been doing.

91
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:18,500
 So actually, throughout this message series, we've had various pastors praising God, telling

92
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,380
 you and telling God what he's been doing in our lives.

93
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:31,260
 You know, how he has met us, how he's provided citizenship and flats and taken care of our

94
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:38,820
 families, and how he has not put us to shame when we placed our trust in him in deep, difficult

95
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,980
 circumstances.

96
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:48,860
 So we tell God, we praise you for that, we worship you, we thank you for that.

97
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,140
 So we acknowledge and recognize who God is and what he has done in our lives.

98
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,100
 And it flows from that recognition and us seeing what he does.

99
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,380
 Now, a lot of times you lose track of that.

100
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,620
 I think that's what happened to me in seminary.

101
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,180
 I lost track of what God was doing and who he was.

102
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,740
 It's kind of weird when you're studying, right, to be a pastor, and you lose track of that,

103
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,920
 but it happens.

104
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:23,620
 But the Holy Spirit revealed to me and showed me a new, you know, God's work in my life,

105
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,260
 which led me into praising him, and I told him what he did.

106
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,020
 In verse 4 it says, "All the earth worships you and sings praises to you.

107
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,460
 They sing praise to your name."

108
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,940
 Actually, this is a response to verse 1.

109
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,780
 In verse 1 it says, "Shout for joy to God all the earth."

110
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:52,980
 And now all the earth has responded, and it gives God worship and praise.

111
00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:00,260
 That's the only appropriate thing that this world can do.

112
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:10,020
 But the statement actually also involves the worship, the Hebrew word for that involves

113
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,820
 bowing down with our bodies.

114
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,300
 It literally means bow before God's majesty.

115
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,820
 So with our bodies, we're called, the world is called to acknowledge who God is.

116
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,180
 And then not only that, we're also meant to sing it with our voices.

117
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,260
 So with body and with voice, we worship God with our whole, basically with our whole being.

118
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
 That's what that means.

119
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:39,540
 With our whole being, we're meant to worship God with our lives, the lives that we live.

120
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,860
 But there's also a prophetic dimension to that statement in verse 4.

121
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,620
 It says, "All the earth worships you."

122
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,780
 It means that's for one what should be, but it's not right now.

123
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:58,940
 But one day all the earth will worship God, and that is certain because of who God is.

124
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:06,460
 It's certain because God will accomplish his purposes for this earth.

125
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:12,340
 And if we recall in the New Testament, if you're familiar with that, for one, Revelations,

126
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:18,500
 the picture is a multicultural, multi-ethnic scene of worship, of the world praising God,

127
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,980
 people from all tribes, tongues, and nations.

128
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,240
 But then in Philippians, in the book, a letter that Paul wrote, it also talks about that

129
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,580
 one day every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.

130
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,460
 And there will be no denying of that.

131
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,460
 Amen.

132
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:45,040
 And so one of the things that we learn in this passage is we worship God for the works

133
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,260
 that he does in our lives, and we praise him.

134
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:58,780
 And the book of Psalms, it's the worship and prayer book for the community of faith.

135
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,940
 And so we're called to praise and called to remember this thing so that it leads us into

136
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
 worship.

137
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,020
 And as we keep going through this, just remember that this is an invitation for us to be refreshed

138
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,000
 and renewed in who God is and how he wants to lead us back into the praise and seeing

139
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,140
 who he is.

140
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,260
 So right now I want to ask the worship team to come up, and I actually want to ask you

141
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,260
 all to stand.

142
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:35,880
 And I want to invite you that we give God worship that matches who he is.

143
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,540
 Now that doesn't mean necessarily being loud.

144
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,940
 You can bow within your heart before God.

145
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,900
 So I just want to encourage you to not worry about who's around you and if somebody dances

146
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:56,100
 or doesn't dance or raises their hand or doesn't, but just come to God right now and just tell

147
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,700
 him how awesome and how amazing he is.

148
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
 So let's do that right now.

149
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:08,400
 Yes, God, we declare that you are worthy of our praise and we pour our praise to you because

150
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,840
 you are the only one who's worthy of our praise.

151
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,960
 We thank you that you are the creator who has created us.

152
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:23,260
 We thank you that you are the one who cares about every one of us, who watches every step

153
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:31,240
 that we take and who meets us in times of need and delivers us.

154
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,800
 And Jesus, ultimately we thank you that you have died and yet you have risen again and

155
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,240
 that in you we have new lives.

156
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,840
 And we praise you for that.

157
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,840
 In your name, Jesus.

158
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,120
 Amen.

159
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,740
 Thank you, worship team.

160
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,180
 So let's continue in Psalm 66 verse 5.

161
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,380
 It says, "Come and see what God has done.

162
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,880
 He is awesome in his deeds towards the children of man.

163
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,880
 He turned the sea into dry land.

164
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,540
 They passed through the river on foot.

165
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:17,060
 There did we rejoice in him who rules by his might forever, whose eyes keep watch on the

166
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,580
 nations.

167
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,180
 Let not the rebellious exalt themselves."

168
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:30,140
 So now the details of God's awesome work get unpacked in the psalm because God works concretely

169
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,980
 in our lives.

170
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,260
 You know, this is not just some abstract concept or thing.

171
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,180
 God works personally.

172
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,500
 He works in history and he works individually.

173
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:50,180
 And so now Israel is recalling, the psalmist is recalling this, the biggest event up until

174
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,780
 this point, which is the Exodus.

175
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,700
 So the story is basically this.

176
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,400
 Israel was enslaved by the Egyptians.

177
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,440
 And God through Moses led his people out of Egypt.

178
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,860
 But then Pharaoh decided to come after them.

179
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,820
 And so as Pharaoh came after them, suddenly the Israelites found themselves stuck between

180
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,180
 Pharaoh's army and the sea.

181
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,740
 And their situation looked desperate.

182
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,460
 But then we're told in verse 6, "He turned the sea into dry land.

183
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,780
 They passed through the river on foot."

184
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,660
 God did a miracle.

185
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:37,940
 He delivered his people and freed them from Egyptian oppression.

186
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,100
 Now this is also a very significant statement about who God is.

187
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,060
 Because during that time, Pharaoh was actually considered like a semi-god or a god.

188
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:54,660
 And so what this says is that God is the only one who is truly powerful.

189
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,700
 And that no one can stop his purposes and his plans.

190
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:05,100
 And that whatever he has planned for his people will come to pass.

191
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,140
 No one can stop him.

192
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,460
 And so we can be confident of that too.

193
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,500
 That God will unfold his purposes that he has for us in our lives, in our community's

194
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,220
 lives, in the city's life.

195
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,860
 You can be confident because God is creator.

196
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,260
 He's the only God.

197
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,700
 So then next, the psalm actually records how the Israelites praised God.

198
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,340
 And at the end of verse 6, it says, "There did we rejoice in him."

199
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,980
 Again it's this act that leads us people right in that moment.

200
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
 You have to rejoice.

201
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,420
 You cannot ignore what just has happened.

202
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,980
 And so they praised God.

203
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,460
 And actually if you read Exodus 15, it talks about that.

204
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,860
 They sang a new song.

205
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,940
 So they made up a new song with new lyrics about what just had happened.

206
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:08,820
 And it praised and it honored God.

207
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:17,380
 And through this recounting of the Exodus story, we can see God's work in our lives.

208
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:24,140
 And it encourages the community as it recalls this event and recalls also new events.

209
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,060
 And we're also encouraged when we do that, when we recall how God has been working in

210
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,660
 our community's lives.

211
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,620
 Today before the 9 a.m. service, 915 service, and also before the 11 a.m. service, I heard

212
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,820
 two testimonies of God working.

213
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:46,960
 One of them had to do with God, somebody whose employer has not allowed them to come back

214
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,340
 to church.

215
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,220
 And we were asked to pray for that.

216
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
 And so we've been praying for that.

217
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,860
 And today that person was here.

218
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,700
 So praise God.

219
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,740
 And the second thing was another person that shared with me.

220
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,660
 Last week we prayed for something, and this week the prayer was answered.

221
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,260
 I'm not going to go into detail.

222
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,540
 But we need to share these testimonies with each other because God is at work.

223
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,900
 He's at work in our life.

224
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,740
 He's at work in this community.

225
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,820
 We often lose sight of that.

226
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,820
 We forget that.

227
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:26,860
 Or we struggle to trust that God is powerful to act and to move.

228
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,060
 And we need to say, "Come and see."

229
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,660
 This is an invitation.

230
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,340
 Our worship is an invitation every week to come and see who God is, to remember who He

231
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,300
 is.

232
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,980
 As I was preparing this, I was reminded of a friend a long time ago.

233
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,820
 He enjoyed my worship music.

234
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,160
 He didn't have a Christian background, a German friend.

235
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,100
 And so I ended up, this is like in the Stone Ages, I ended up giving him some CDs.

236
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,980
 And they were, at that time, they were really precious.

237
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:09,060
 But it was a come and see thing because the songs, they sang about, you know, God and

238
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,760
 who He is and what He has done.

239
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,100
 So I invited my friend to come and see who God is.

240
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,780
 And in a very long process, not just through that, he ended up becoming a Christian.

241
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,660
 But that's a long story for another time.

242
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:29,060
 So the second thing that we learn about praise is when we praise God for His rescuing work

243
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:35,060
 in our lives, it is an invitation for others to come and see and learn about the awesome

244
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:42,340
 works of God and to join in and praise Him.

245
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,700
 So let's continue with the third stanza of the psalm.

246
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,380
 Continuing in verse 8, it says, "Bless our God, O peoples!

247
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,300
 Let the sound of His praise be heard, who has kept our soul among the living and has

248
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,220
 not let our feet slip.

249
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,780
 For you, O God, have tested us.

250
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,060
 You have tried us as silver is tried.

251
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,760
 You brought us into the net.

252
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,980
 You laid a crushing burden on our heads and our backs.

253
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,740
 You let men ride over our heads.

254
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,780
 You went through fire and through water.

255
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:19,300
 Yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance."

256
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:27,060
 So in verses 8 through 9, we're called to praise God because He protects us and guides

257
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,060
 us.

258
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,060
 He preserves us and keeps us.

259
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:39,500
 And I love this, that it talks about, "and has not let our feet slip."

260
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:47,580
 Every step that we take, God watches over us and He does not let our feet slip.

261
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,380
 He preserves us.

262
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,700
 Now if you look at that, initially you might think, "Oh, then the whole Christian life

263
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,700
 is easy.

264
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,940
 You know, it's never a hard time."

265
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,420
 But that's why there's that second part that shows that it's not always easy.

266
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,820
 And the life of the people of God has not always been easy.

267
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:12,060
 And the life of Israel, which there's some references to their suffering and their trials,

268
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,420
 it hasn't been easy.

269
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,460
 But let's look at verse 10, which unpacks that a little bit.

270
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,780
 It says, "For you, O God, have tested us.

271
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,660
 You have tried us as silver is tried."

272
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:29,140
 So there's times in our lives where things are going well and it's easy to praise and

273
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,620
 to worship God.

274
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,900
 And maybe we're quoting scriptures and doing all sorts of things.

275
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,000
 But then there's times when you go through trials.

276
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,420
 What about then?

277
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:46,100
 Do we praise God during difficult times?

278
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,100
 So here it says those trials are also times of testing.

279
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,020
 They're times of testing of what's in us.

280
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,420
 What kind of faith do we have?

281
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:01,220
 So it's this metaphor of, "Tried us as silver is tried."

282
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,700
 So it talks about smelting and you heat up the silver and all the impurities and the

283
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,300
 dross comes out.

284
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,140
 It's revealed through that heating up process.

285
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,420
 And just our trials are that way.

286
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,380
 They reveal what's in us.

287
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:21,980
 And they bring out the impurities, maybe some sinfulness in our lives, but maybe also where

288
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,780
 we hold on to things, where we place our trust in other things.

289
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,260
 Maybe we trust in our money, maybe we trust in our health, maybe we trust in our position.

290
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,660
 But in those trials, we realize they don't deliver.

291
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,660
 They don't deliver.

292
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,080
 It's only God who delivers.

293
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,800
 And so these times of trial, they expose those things in us.

294
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,960
 And God uses that to strengthen and to deepen our faith.

295
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,880
 And He also does that to strengthen our character, to work His character into our lives, that

296
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,920
 we reflect His character more.

297
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:05,280
 Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty confident that for me, times of trials have

298
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,280
 been, I mean, they have been very difficult and painful, but they've also been the times

299
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,560
 where I've learned in the deepest way who God is.

300
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,400
 And because of what I've gone through and because of things you've gone through, we

301
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,760
 are more confident now when things come up, because we know who God is, because He has

302
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,000
 met us in difficult times and we can face them, because through those trials, God has

303
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,680
 strengthened our faith.

304
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:46,320
 So, the psalmist recalls these trials, and he actually goes into detail of them.

305
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,520
 He says in verse 11 and 12, "You brought us into the net.

306
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,940
 You laid a crushing burn on our backs.

307
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,360
 You let men ride over our heads.

308
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,880
 We went through fire and through water."

309
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,440
 So these are all metaphors of things that Israel went through.

310
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,720
 They were hunted, like somebody hunts animals with a net.

311
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,000
 They went through forced labor.

312
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,880
 Their country was run over by other armies.

313
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,040
 And then they also had to escape fires and waters.

314
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,360
 So they have gone through trials.

315
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
 They have known it.

316
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,920
 They have known them.

317
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,240
 But then the end of verse 12 tells us, "Yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance."

318
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,120
 But God has met the people of God.

319
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,520
 He has kept their foot from slipping.

320
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,480
 Yes, those times, those trials, they have not been easy.

321
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,200
 And they've been very painful, even just as you see in those metaphors.

322
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,020
 But God has brought them out to a place of abundance.

323
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,720
 He has not abandoned them, and neither does God abandon us.

324
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:02,640
 He also brings us out into places where we can flourish, and places of blessing.

325
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:10,160
 And for me, throughout the Summer Psalms message series, I was so encouraged by the stories

326
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:17,000
 shared by Pastor Carla, Pastor Promise, Pastor John.

327
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,280
 You know, the testimonies of how God had cared for their family, had provided for them when

328
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,480
 they couldn't do it out of their own strength.

329
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:36,560
 So God takes us through these trials, but He's with us, and He preserves us, and He

330
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,240
 does bring us to places of flourishing and of His goodness.

331
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,120
 So the third thing that we learn about praising God is that we praise God for His work, both

332
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,920
 in our suffering, but also in our abundance.

333
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,100
 And we praise God that He is always with us, and He doesn't leave us.

334
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,880
 He's with us every step of the way.

335
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,000
 So then let's look at the final two standards of the Psalm.

336
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,600
 In verse 13, we'll continue.

337
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,400
 It says, "I will come into your house with burnt offerings.

338
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,360
 I will perform my vows to you, that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when

339
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,280
 I was in trouble.

340
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:22,680
 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals with the smoke of the sacrifice of

341
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,760
 rams.

342
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,360
 I will make an offering of bulls and goats."

343
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,880
 Now, what's this about?

344
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,200
 Put very simply, here's a person that found themselves in difficult circumstances, and

345
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,380
 they told God, "God, if you help me, if you deliver me, I promise you I will bring you

346
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,960
 worship through burnt offerings.

347
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,480
 I will go in your temple and praise you."

348
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,800
 And this has now happened, so this person's on their way to do that.

349
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,400
 And then afterwards, that person shares a testimony.

350
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
 So let's look at that.

351
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,480
 Verse 16, it says, "Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what He has

352
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,920
 done for my soul.

353
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,180
 I cried to Him with my mouth, and high praise was on my tongue.

354
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:22,140
 If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.

355
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,120
 But truly God has listened.

356
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,740
 He has attended to the voice of my prayer.

357
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:35,740
 Blessed be God, because He has not rejected my prayer or removed His steadfast love from

358
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:41,360
 me."

359
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,540
 And I love this.

360
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,580
 The individual, the person, you know, he has experienced God's deliverance, and he's like,

361
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
 "Come and hear!

362
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,940
 I have to tell you about it.

363
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,940
 Come, everybody, get together.

364
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,580
 Let me share with you what God has done."

365
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,420
 And so he calls them together, and it's a very, he shares very simply.

366
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:06,260
 It doesn't always have to be this fancy, long story.

367
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:14,340
 The testimony is, "I cried out to God, and God heard my prayer."

368
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,960
 So God, He works through testimonies of the community, and we need to actually share when

369
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,220
 we experience God working in our lives, when we experience God answering our prayers, we

370
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,660
 need to share that, because God wants to encourage each other.

371
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,980
 He wants to encourage us, and He also wants to lead us in praising God.

372
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:38,140
 I remember, again, through this sermon series, I mean, I was praising God for what He had

373
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:44,580
 done in my colleagues' life, and it was amazing.

374
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:51,100
 So even you sharing your testimony, your story of how God has worked, you know, God can use

375
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,740
 that to encourage others, but also lead them into praising God and renew their worship

376
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,340
 of who God is, because we lose constantly track of who God is.

377
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:07,200
 We're like the sheep that always gets lost.

378
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,960
 But I want to touch on two things.

379
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,540
 The first one is simply the act of coming to God and entrusting to Him what's going

380
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:22,900
 on and praying and asking Him to provide, that actually is also part of our worship,

381
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,980
 because we're acknowledging that God is able to help.

382
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,040
 And we might not even be that confident in that.

383
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,420
 Maybe we just have very little faith, but God can work with very little faith.

384
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,060
 You know, and that honors God when we take that step.

385
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:42,540
 So for some of us here today, maybe this is the step for you that you need to take.

386
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,940
 Maybe you've kept things to yourself, but actually God is inviting you to come and bring

387
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,260
 that to Him, and that is your worship.

388
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:54,920
 Trust and trust Him with what's been going on in your life and your heart.

389
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,940
 The second thing is verse 18.

390
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,260
 It says, "If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened."

391
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:08,860
 Now, I don't know about you, but I don't use the word iniquity very much.

392
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,420
 Do you use that in everyday conversation?

393
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
 No?

394
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,540
 It's like, "Hey, how's your iniquity?

395
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,540
 How's that been going?"

396
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
 What does that mean?

397
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:25,620
 Well, that phrase means basically finding pleasure in our sin and not wanting to let

398
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:30,380
 go of it and delighting in it.

399
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:36,940
 And it's basically a heart that is not repentant, that doesn't want to repent, that just loves

400
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,680
 whatever that thing is that we're clinging to, that sin, it just loves it too much and

401
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,820
 takes pleasure in it.

402
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:53,340
 And so if we cling to sin, we cannot cling to God if we just keep holding on to that

403
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,180
 and delighting in that.

404
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,560
 And so here we learn that whether we're committed to God actually impacts the effectiveness

405
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,380
 of our prayer.

406
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:11,100
 If we're not committed to God, you know, we don't have any ground to expect God to answer

407
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,100
 our prayers.

408
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:18,860
 Now, God in His grace, I think a lot of time does, but we don't stand on any ground to

409
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,380
 expect Him to answer our prayers.

410
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:25,140
 He answers the prayer of His people, those who are committed to Him, who are faithful

411
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,140
 to Him.

412
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,340
 And this is not about perfection, just a trajectory.

413
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,780
 You know, if you're committed to honoring God and that's the path you're on, like we

414
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,700
 still a lot of times don't do it, but nonetheless, that's the journey we're on.

415
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,700
 But if you're delighting in your sin, you're on a totally different path, like if you don't

416
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,920
 even want to let go.

417
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,400
 And so God answers the prayer of His people, those who trust Him and who walk with Him.

418
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,580
 And so the psalmist then encourages us with that.

419
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:58,980
 And so perhaps for some of us today, maybe that's the thing that God wants to speak to

420
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,140
 us where we need to let go of something that we've been holding on to, something that we've

421
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:11,740
 been treasuring in our heart, but that God is asking us to repent of and to let go.

422
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:17,580
 So if that's you, I want to encourage you to do that.

423
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,540
 And when we do that, that also is an act of our worship, of acknowledging that God is

424
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:28,180
 worthy of us giving ourselves to Him.

425
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:37,660
 And then at the end, there's a testimony of an answered prayer and an affirmation of God's

426
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,700
 steadfast love.

427
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,180
 God is committed to us.

428
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,180
 He loves us.

429
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,540
 And He wants us to know His love.

430
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,400
 He wants to show it to us.

431
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,460
 It's a covenantal love into His people, and He wants to make that known.

432
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,420
 Because the person that experienced God's love when He declares that love, that he has

433
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,140
 experienced God's love.

434
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,980
 So the first thing that we learn about praising God is that we praise God through our personal

435
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,880
 testimonies of His provision.

436
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,020
 And it blesses others, it encourages others, it speaks of God's love for us, and encourages

437
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,820
 us to do that as well, to come to God in prayer and experience for ourself what God is able

438
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,420
 to do.

439
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:30,140
 So let me summarize some of the highlights that I've shared so far about why we worship.

440
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:36,540
 First we praise God for His awesome works, because God does awesome and amazing works

441
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:41,060
 in our lives.

442
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,700
 And the only appropriate response is to give Him praise.

443
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:50,140
 And then second, we praise God so that others can come and see who God is, and that they

444
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,740
 can be encouraged, and that they can get to know God.

445
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:02,460
 And then third, we praise God also what He does, how He brings us through times of trial.

446
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:09,140
 You know that He's with us every step of the way, that He doesn't let our feet slip, and

447
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:18,740
 that He brings us out of the trial onto solid ground, into a place of abundance.

448
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:26,420
 And finally, we praise God and encourage others through our personal testimonies.

449
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:32,140
 Now this psalm is given, you know, to the community, as I mentioned earlier, it's part

450
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,060
 of the prayer book, the worship book of Israel.

451
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,460
 And it's really meant to make ourselves reflect on God's goodness in our lives, just like

452
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:44,180
 He's been good in Israel's life and in this individual's life.

453
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,020
 A lot of times we don't even notice what God has been doing in our own lives, in our own

454
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
 community's lives.

455
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:54,100
 So this is an invitation today for us to reflect on God's goodness.

456
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,300
 And it also calls us to praise God.

457
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,980
 So it's also a call for us to give God that praise that He deserves.

458
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,420
 And for me, the sense for today as I was praying over the message was really that God wants

459
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,100
 to renew our worship.

460
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,620
 You know, a lot of us have been going through dry seasons.

461
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:19,340
 There's been maybe even an absence of experience of God's presence.

462
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,780
 And God wants to renew that and He wants to restore that and He wants to refresh us.

463
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:30,580
 As I was praying, I had an image of a display of a phone.

464
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,140
 And on that phone, you know, you have the battery thing, and the battery was empty.

465
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:39,500
 And I had a sense that this was a lot of us, our batteries are empty.

466
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,220
 And that God wants to restore and refresh us as we come and give Him the praise with

467
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,220
 our lives.

468
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:52,620
 He wants to recharge us, strengthen our faith, give us hope.

469
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:59,260
 So earlier I mentioned that during my seminary time, there was a time where I didn't worship

470
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,260
 God very much.

471
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:06,700
 And perhaps you, like me, are right now walking through a season where you've lost a sense

472
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:14,380
 of awareness of God's goodness, God's awesomeness.

473
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,080
 And this dry season, you know, who knows what the reason is.

474
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,500
 Maybe it's because of difficult things you're experiencing, or the city is experiencing,

475
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,100
 this world is experiencing.

476
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:31,440
 Maybe it's because you've got distracted, you're focusing on something else.

477
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:42,220
 But whatever the reason is, God is inviting us anew to turn our eyes to Him and to remember

478
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:48,840
 His goodness in our lives, all the amazing things that He has done, maybe even show something

479
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,140
 new we haven't noticed before.

480
00:35:52,140 --> 00:36:00,560
 And He's inviting us to humble ourselves and allow the Holy Spirit to lead us in this refreshing

481
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,420
 and this renewing.

482
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,580
 So right now I want to invite the worship team to come up.

483
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:16,420
 And I want to invite you to close your eyes right now and to actually have a heart-to-heart

484
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,900
 moment with God.

485
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:23,340
 You know, if you've been going through a difficult time, you know, just bring whatever's going

486
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,980
 on to God that honors Him, that's worship to Him.

487
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,100
 It gives Him praise when we do that.

488
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:36,840
 If you've been, yeah, just struggling to see God's goodness, maybe just ask God to even

489
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,880
 show you His goodness.

490
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,560
 But if you do see it, just start giving Him praise for the things you're thankful for,

491
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,560
 and allow the Holy Spirit to lead you and then praise Him.

492
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,880
 Let's do that for a moment, and in about 30 seconds or so I'll say a closing prayer for

493
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,620
 us and then we'll go into worship.

494
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:06,520
 Tell God the things we're thankful for.

495
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:22,300
 Jesus, You know the space that we're in, where we are on this journey of worshiping and praising

496
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,300
 You.

497
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:32,740
 I pray right now that You meet every one of us, and that You lead us in what You want

498
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,980
 us to do.

499
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,420
 We thank You that You are the one who loves us, that You are the one who's at work in

500
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:48,820
 our lives, who changes our lives, who gives us hope when everything seems hopeless.

501
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,940
 We thank You that, yeah, You love us perfectly and that You are faithful.

502
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,900
 Maybe others are unfaithful, but You are always faithful to us and we praise You for that.

503
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:05,500
 And so I pray that as we pour out our thanksgiving to You right now, Holy Spirit, I pray that

504
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:12,820
 You start refreshing and renewing us and recharging us, that You give us a sense, O Holy Spirit,

505
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:20,980
 of Your presence and what You're doing, that You would strengthen our faith so that we

506
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:25,380
 can move forward in what You have for us.

507
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,140
 So we thank You and we praise You and we worship You.

508
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,340
 I pray this in Your name, Jesus.

509
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:30,780
 Amen.
