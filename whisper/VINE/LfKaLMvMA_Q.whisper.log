[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   delivers it now, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.420]   - Amen, thanks.
[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.560]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.400]   Oh, full, okay.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.020]   Today's gonna be fun.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.820]   We're gonna be going through the parables again.
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.240]   This is week two.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.660]   And just a bit of a reminder,
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.840]   kind of a recap for all of us to get back on the same page,
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.820]   'cause I sometimes talk too fast,
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.900]   and I don't want anyone to get lost,
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.020]   so let me just kind of lay out what we're doing.
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.820]   Picking up in the parables, we're gonna remember
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.060]   and recall the idea that the purpose of parables,
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.800]   pretty simple, there's these big, profound truths
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.840]   about the kingdom of God, about the kingdom of heaven,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.520]   about the Father, that can be challenging
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.100]   for us to fully grasp.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.580]   So Jesus, knowing that, provided these parables,
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.620]   ways for us to be able to understand,
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.540]   for us to peel back into some of those layers.
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.980]   So using stories sometimes is the best way.
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.860]   So that's why we're doing this sermon series.
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.260]   We've got four parables.
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.760]   Last week, if you were here,
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.340]   Pastor Ellison walked us through the parable of the sower.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.180]   We saw all the different ideas of where the seed is thrown,
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.600]   and ultimately the story and the meaning behind that
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.860]   was the soil of our hearts.
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.660]   We need to make sure the soil of our hearts
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.320]   is fertile ground for the word of God
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.320]   to actually be planted and to bloom and to live within us.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.060]   This week, we're gonna turn our attention towards Luke 15,
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.020]   looking at the parable of the prodigal son,
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020]   or the lost son, or the two sons.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.020]   Now, this parable is, it's one of three, actually,
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.180]   in Luke 15.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.020]   Why do I keep saying John?
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.940]   Luke 15.
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.140]   So Jesus starts off by talking about some sheep
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260]   and about how there's all these sheep this guy has,
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.540]   and then he loses one, and he goes and finds it,
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.880]   and he rejoices, like, "Celebrate with me.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.440]   "My lost sheep is back."
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.860]   And then he goes to a coin.
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.860]   This lady has a bunch of coins, and she loses one,
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.500]   and she looks everywhere and finds the one coin,
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.340]   and she celebrates.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.780]   She says, "Guys, come celebrate with me.
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.240]   "Rejoice, I found my coin."
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.780]   And then, so he takes the sheep, the coin,
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.340]   and then he jumps like a massive level
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.940]   and then brings it to family.
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.500]   Talks about sons and about fathers
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.180]   and about the relationship,
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.420]   and ends up looking at lost sons and that whole journey.
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.500]   And so normally here at the Vine,
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.060]   what we would do is we would put up the text behind us,
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.900]   and we would all read it,
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.660]   or I would read it and you would watch.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.340]   But in the spirit of this being a parable,
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.580]   I kinda wanna take us to that posture
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.820]   of what it would've been like to hear it
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.780]   for the first time.
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.260]   So back when Jesus was preaching,
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.140]   he didn't have PowerPoints.
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.260]   There wasn't a great creative team
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.140]   to make it all look nice.
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.740]   So we're gonna go back to that space just for a minute.
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.940]   You won't be able to read along.
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.780]   That's on purpose.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.660]   We're not gonna put the scripture up.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.260]   I'm gonna tell you the story.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.580]   And one of the ways I feel like
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.860]   it can really help you dive into this
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.380]   is if you sit back, relax, take a breath, get comfortable,
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.740]   close your eyes, but don't fall asleep, okay?
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.820]   Okay, I saw someone at 9.15.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.140]   I didn't clarify that the first time.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.060]   Close your eyes.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.100]   I'm just gonna tell you the story.
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.060]   I'm not actually gonna read it either.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.340]   I'm gonna give you a rendition of it.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.180]   And then what we're gonna do
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.100]   is we're gonna look at the characters,
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.580]   at what lessons is Jesus really wanting us
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.460]   to pull from this,
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.340]   and actually, hopefully, understand more about God
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.100]   and understand more about the kingdom of God.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.940]   So let me pray, and then you can close your eyes,
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.780]   and we're gonna get started.
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.300]   Jesus, we thank you for your word.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.940]   We thank you that you understood the human condition
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.020]   and that we sometimes need stories
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.100]   to really understand and wrestle with your truth.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.540]   So Holy Spirit, would you just be with us this morning
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.340]   as we look at this story of the two sons?
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.540]   Would you open our eyes, open our ears
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.860]   to hear what it is that you want us to know
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.020]   about who you are, about the Father,
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.980]   and about the kingdom of God.
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.420]   We ask you these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.980]   All right, eyes closed, here we go.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.300]   There was a dude, there was a man,
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.420]   there was an older guy who had two sons.
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.060]   He had these two kids, and the youngest of the two kids
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.140]   was a little crazy.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.500]   He was like, "Dad, give me my inheritance now."
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.780]   So Dad gave him his inheritance.
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.140]   He divided up his property
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.860]   and gave his son his inheritance early.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.700]   And what did the son do?
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.340]   The son set off for a distant land, went far away.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.340]   And he spent all of his money on wild, reckless living.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.940]   And then, when he has no more money,
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.180]   just at that point, the nation that he's in
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.260]   goes into famine.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.500]   They can't grow any food, there's no water,
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   everything is tight and challenging,
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.260]   and he's hit rock bottom with money,
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.900]   and now the land he's in has no food,
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.060]   and there's no opportunity for him,
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.780]   and he's really looking for a place to go,
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.100]   and he doesn't have any money, so he tries to get a job.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.340]   He can't find anyone to give him a job,
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.500]   so he sees this one position open,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.220]   and it's a pretty unfun position, it's feeding pigs.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.660]   So he takes the job feeding the pigs,
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.100]   and while he's out there feeding the pigs one day,
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.940]   making very little money, he's so hungry,
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.540]   I mean, he's desperately hungry,
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.620]   that the food the pigs are eating looks appetizing,
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.100]   so he wants to eat that.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.420]   And then he has this moment where he comes to his senses,
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.500]   and he's like, hold on, in my dad's house,
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.340]   you know, the servants have food to spare.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.180]   So he's like, you know what I'll do?
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.860]   I'll pack up my things, and I'll go back to my dad,
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.220]   and I'll tell him, dad, I've sinned against heaven,
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.820]   and against you, I'm no longer worthy to be called your son,
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.700]   but if you would just give me a position as a servant.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.300]   So he got his little speech together,
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.940]   and he picked up nothing that he had,
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.740]   and just walked back, started going back.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.860]   And while he was a long ways off, the father sees him,
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.140]   and his compassion, and his joy.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.460]   He runs to his son, and throws his arms around him,
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.620]   and kisses him, and his son's like, father,
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.340]   I'm no longer worthy to be called your son,
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.580]   I have sinned against heaven, and against you,
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.620]   and the father stops him, and he's like,
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.620]   y'all, let's celebrate, go get the fattest cow we have,
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.820]   bring a ring and put it on his hand,
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.780]   grab some sandals for him, put a robe around him,
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.500]   my son who was lost is now found.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.540]   So they did, they got a party together.
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.820]   And the older son who was there was out in the fields,
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.900]   and he was working, and he heard all this ruckus,
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.380]   and this noise, so he makes his way back over.
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.700]   He's asking the servants, what's going on?
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.380]   Servant's like, your brother who was lost is back,
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.700]   and your dad's killed the biggest cow that we have for him.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.660]   So brother gets a bit annoyed and frustrated,
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.460]   so annoyed that he won't even go into the celebration.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.140]   The father comes out, and pleased with his son,
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.620]   and his son's like, dad, I've been here the whole time,
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.460]   I've never disobeyed a word that you said,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.980]   and you've not even killed a goat for me,
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.220]   for me and my friends.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.440]   Dad says, you have me with you always,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.100]   but listen, we have to rejoice, we have to celebrate,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.840]   because your brother who was once lost is now found.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.860]   You can open your eyes again.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.180]   This is one of the most beautiful stories of love
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.660]   in all of scripture.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.700]   It's incredible, right, but it's complex.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.220]   It's deep, and it revolves around
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.100]   these three main characters.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.860]   There's the father, there's the son who runs away
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.100]   and squanders all the money,
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.180]   and then there's the son who stays
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.980]   and has something to say to the dad.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.540]   And I think what Jesus meant to do
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.300]   was for us to look at these three characters,
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.000]   look at the context of the story,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.380]   and really understand what the kingdom of heaven is like,
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.220]   and what the father himself is like.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.860]   So we're gonna do that by first looking at the first son
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.180]   and seeing what lesson does Jesus ultimately
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.980]   wanna teach us through this first son.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.820]   So that first son, the one that runs away,
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.780]   gets the money, runs off, goes to a faraway land.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.300]   I found this detail very interesting.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.640]   He goes far away.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.580]   He gets his money, rather than going next door
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.580]   or going to the neighboring,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.020]   he goes to a distant land away from everyone
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.460]   to do his own thing.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.240]   Doesn't wanna be in a relationship with anybody anymore,
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.580]   doesn't want any accountability,
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.500]   wants to go and do his own thing.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.500]   So he does that, he emancipates himself,
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.700]   he removes himself from the family.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.660]   He goes and he has no stewardship at all, no home training.
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.940]   He spends all his money and does a poor job budgeting.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.300]   And once that's done, the land ends up in famine,
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.980]   which is terrible, so now he's hitting rock bottom.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.500]   There's nothing he can do to get himself back up.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.020]   He said he's eating the food of pigs,
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.140]   and I think we're all familiar with that part.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.340]   His life literally couldn't get any worse,
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.380]   and I think it's really interesting,
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.060]   'cause I think maybe for lots of us
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.980]   who might have hit a version of rock bottom,
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.220]   we found this, in that moment of rock bottom,
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.460]   something clicks.
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.340]   He has a bit of an experience, something changes.
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.580]   It says that he comes to his senses.
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.340]   I think the first truth that we see
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.540]   around this parable is what repentance is.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.660]   Repentance is much like coming to your senses.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.260]   To come to one's senses would mean
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.860]   that whatever you might have believed prior to that moment,
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.260]   you now understand is incorrect, it was misleading.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.060]   It was an illusion, or at best, it was incomplete.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.620]   And all the son had done before,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.420]   all his actions of reckless spending and running away
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.620]   and taking his dad's stuff was based off of his perspective,
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.580]   based off of the way that he saw things.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.420]   And so to repent, that first stage looks like
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.980]   changing the way that we see, coming to our senses.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.560]   To repent is to have a new perspective.
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.340]   It must mean that we have to think differently
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.700]   about our situation, about our sin.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.700]   We must have that change of perspective
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.420]   and that coming to our senses.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.100]   But we know, we all know that it doesn't end there, right?
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.600]   Repentance can't just be the way that you see things.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.260]   It can't just be about more head knowledge
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.020]   or more information.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.340]   Just because you understand more
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.060]   or because you have more information
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.980]   doesn't really make the change, does it?
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.380]   I mean, think about our culture today.
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.900]   We have access to the most amount of information ever
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.420]   than any period in history.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.700]   That doesn't necessarily mean
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.020]   that things are changing for the better.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.640]   What we don't need is necessarily more information.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.980]   Sometimes what we do need is more obedience.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.540]   And what does information do if there is no action?
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.180]   And so although, yes, repentance will start
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.100]   with that turning of the mind
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.720]   and more information being changed,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   it must lead, it mandates that we then turn our will,
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.000]   that we then turn our actions,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.140]   that we then turn ourselves.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.100]   You're probably wondering why am I saying the word turn?
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.700]   Well, the word repent itself means to turn.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.140]   So if I'm repenting, if I'm walking this way,
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.940]   to repent would mean to turn around, right?
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.800]   So that's what this young man is doing.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.680]   He is turning around in his mind and his perspective,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.060]   but then he also physically turns around.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.280]   He returns to the Father.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.580]   He leaves his foolish thinking and his foolish living,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.980]   and he makes his way back to the Father.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.700]   And what Jesus partially tells us this story
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.160]   so that we can get to this next part,
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.380]   about what happens next,
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.240]   when we would turn and we would repent,
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.460]   which is actually the reason I was so excited
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.280]   about preaching this specific sermon
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.120]   is for this next section.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.500]   The son that repents and turns, what happens to him next?
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.900]   The story goes that, well, the Father does something crazy,
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   does something radical, something that is off script
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.420]   that no one would expect, right?
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.460]   The Father isn't reckless.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.700]   The Father is responding to deep love.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.260]   The Father is calculated.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.660]   The actions of the Father
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.820]   are therefore interested in restoring.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.660]   The text would say this,
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.100]   while he was a long way off, speaking of the son,
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.660]   his father saw him and was filled with compassion.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.780]   He ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.660]   The son said, "Father, I've sinned against heaven
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.500]   "and against you.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.980]   "I'm no longer worthy to be called your son."
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.080]   But the Father said to his servants,
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.320]   "Quick, bring the best robe, put it on him.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.500]   "Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.960]   "Bring the fattened calf and kill it.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.440]   "Let's have a feast and celebrate,
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.620]   "for the son of mine was dead and is alive again.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.140]   "He was lost and is now found."
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.340]   So they began to celebrate.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.580]   The Father is overjoyed to see the son again.
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.140]   He doesn't wait for the son to make it all the way back.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.340]   He says, while he was a long way off,
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.300]   the Father sprints toward him.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.060]   The son's not even close to being home yet.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.660]   The Father doesn't even meet him halfway.
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.700]   This idea that God's gonna meet us halfway
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.540]   is not biblical, right?
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.780]   Like, God goes the whole way.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.740]   Like, the son is all the way over there
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.580]   and the Father sees that he's turned around
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.020]   and is coming back and he runs towards him
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.860]   in compassion, overjoyed about this.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.140]   And I think it gets me, what gets me is,
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.220]   when I try and visualize how beautiful this is,
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.560]   I think about my three-year-old son
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.140]   and how if there was a moment where he's coming to me,
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.300]   we used to live in Chonkwano
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.940]   and I used to get home from work late
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.900]   and it'd be around maybe like seven or something
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.780]   and my wife would leave our estate
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.180]   and start walking towards us and I'd be walking home.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.040]   And the second I saw my son,
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.340]   I mean, I didn't physically run because it's hot in Hong Kong
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.820]   but my heart ran, I was thrilled, I was so excited.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.020]   I could only imagine, you know,
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.320]   when I've not seen my son for a whole day,
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.060]   this dude's son has been in a different country.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.600]   The condition and the appearance of the son is saddening,
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.440]   probably breaks his heart.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.640]   So it probably pushes him even more into that moment
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.600]   but the father runs to him, drops everything
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.540]   and is filled with compassion to see his boy again.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:14.720]   This is a decisive and aggressive, fervent love.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.600]   It's extreme grace.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.120]   And it's extreme grace because note this,
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.240]   the father could have just forgiven him.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.580]   This would have been a beautiful parable
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.100]   if it was about how a son really messed up,
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.020]   I mean, as bad as it gets and he gets what he deserves
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.380]   and when he comes and tries to apologize,
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.340]   the father says, "Okay, you're forgiven."
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.180]   And that's the end of the parable.
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.540]   If that was the story,
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.980]   that would be a pretty powerful parable.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.140]   But it doesn't just stop there.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.100]   The father's love is so extreme.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.140]   It's so extreme that the son tries to get out his phrase,
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.500]   "Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.400]   I'm no longer worthy."
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.040]   And I imagine the father just putting his hand
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.300]   to his son's mouth, saying, "Stop.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.280]   You're my son.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.760]   You're here.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.160]   That's what matters."
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.000]   And the father doesn't just forgive him.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.800]   The father reinstates him.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.640]   Rather than saying, "All is forgiven.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.240]   Your slate is clean."
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.600]   The father says, "Go get the best stuff we have.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.280]   Get the best robe," he says.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.980]   "Get a ring, get a sandal, kill the A5 Wagyu."
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.560]   Like he wants the good stuff for his son,
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.080]   who has just done all this mess.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.760]   He does not just forgive us.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.520]   He reinstates.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.080]   And I think we have to come to the understanding
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.660]   that this is God's posture.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.640]   This is the father's posture to us as well.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.420]   Can we talk about how,
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.320]   if I put myself in the position of the son,
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.960]   forgiveness would have been great.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.980]   But I wonder how he felt when his dad hugged him
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:48.820]   in that moment.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.700]   I wonder what he felt when he's dirty and stinky
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.780]   and smelly and tired and exhausted and not worthy,
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.780]   yet his father throws his arms around him.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.700]   Talk about getting more than you deserve.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.980]   I feel like that motion probably,
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.460]   that moment probably flooded him with plenty of emotion
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.720]   to be received again.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.620]   See, the father had no intention
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.740]   of making a repentant son a slave.
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.100]   I think we have to hear that for what it's really saying.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.700]   Our father has no intention
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.180]   of making a repentant us a slave,
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.940]   but rather in his great joy,
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.420]   he restores us back to sonship and daughtership.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.940]   It is joy that he does it.
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.380]   It's not because he has to,
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.460]   because he's God, because he's obligated.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.460]   It's within his joy.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.340]   And if you don't believe me,
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.700]   three different times it says it.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.540]   In the first parable about the sheep,
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.740]   it says this, at the very end of it,
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.100]   he goes, "Rejoice with me.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.420]   "I have found my lost sheep."
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.820]   When the parable gets to the next part about the coin,
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.100]   the woman says, "Rejoice with me.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.420]   "I found my lost coin."
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.020]   When it gets to the son for the third time,
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.700]   "Rejoice and celebrate, be glad."
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.440]   There is joy that God feels about restoring you.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.180]   When you come back, it is in his joy to bring you,
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.800]   not just to forgive you, but to reinstate you,
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.100]   to bring you into the family of God.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.420]   Because in that space,
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.900]   there is a relationship that is restored.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.780]   In that space, there is hope, there is meaning,
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.580]   there is identity.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.960]   He wants to provide all of that for us.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.220]   This restored identity is a theme
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.860]   that we cannot afford to overlook.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.440]   There's something to be said about how identity
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.560]   and relationship are major threads into this story,
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.580]   and into the kingdom of God as a whole.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.420]   I think that's why this story
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.580]   is drenched with identity imagery.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.460]   Did you notice how every main character
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.060]   isn't referred to by their name?
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.700]   Or by their job?
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.500]   It's the father, it's the son, it's the other son.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:55.980]   Who they are communicated as is based off of relationship.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.700]   Relationship is so important.
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.140]   It elevates the meaning of this parable.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.300]   Let me think about it this way.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.620]   What if this parable wasn't called the prodigal son?
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.720]   What if it was called the prodigal friend?
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.660]   You guys know Jethro, who leads worship here,
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.620]   stunning young man with the guitar.
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.060]   He's a good friend of mine.
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.020]   If Jethro took my money and went to Indonesia,
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.340]   love you Jethro, and spent it all,
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.540]   and got what he deserved, lost his money,
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.260]   and is eating pig food, comes back to Hong Kong,
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.240]   and is like, bro, I'm sorry.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.740]   Okay, well, first of all, I'm a pastor,
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.140]   so I'm gonna say yes, Jethro, I forgive you, right?
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.280]   That's what pastors and Christians do.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.380]   But if my son, Elias, made the same mistake,
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.300]   hear this, it would hurt significantly more.
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.140]   It really would.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.440]   It would tear me apart.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:53.100]   But if he came back, that joy would be ridiculous,
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.220]   and I would not stop at saying, you're forgiven, son.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.040]   I'll go do your thing.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.300]   You're forgiven, come be a servant.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.860]   No, I would throw my arms around him, 'cause he's my boy.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.460]   He's my kid, he's me, right?
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.620]   And I think if you understand this story,
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.580]   you understand the power of family,
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.140]   that's what Jesus is talking about.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.680]   It's not just about the forgiveness of the sin,
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.140]   it's about the ultimate goal being restoring us
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.300]   into the right identity.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.900]   The scriptures talk about this all over the place.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.780]   Why do you think it is that we're called sons and daughters
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.300]   of God, children of God?
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.720]   When Jesus would teach the disciples to pray,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.820]   which I find very fascinating,
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.580]   the one thing they tell him is, teach us this.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.620]   They could tell him, they could ask him, teach us anything.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.140]   He says, teach us how to pray.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.540]   So Jesus says, okay, fine, I'll teach you how to pray.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.180]   At that time, their posture towards divinity
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.940]   was that God is holy, God is Yahweh,
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.220]   we gotta be careful, make sure we don't sin too much,
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.140]   go through all these rituals.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.560]   And he says, when you pray, pray like this.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.740]   Our father, relationship.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.660]   Not our extreme maker who is bigger than everything
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.500]   or Elohim or our father.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.780]   There is something so significant
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.980]   in this relationship identity concept
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.420]   that the scripture wants us to understand,
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.580]   and it's because of this.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.580]   As children of God, we get certain perks.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.980]   There are things that happen within the family
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.380]   that won't happen outside the family.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.140]   The way I love my son would be inappropriate
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.980]   for me to love any other person that way.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.340]   The way I love my spouse or my daughter
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.180]   would be very different
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.700]   than the way I'm gonna love my friends,
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.220]   or the way I'm gonna engage with my friends.
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.540]   See, when you're in the family, there's something different.
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.260]   There's a grace that's for the family,
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260]   there's a certain compassion that's for the family.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.000]   The family deeply matters.
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.100]   And I think about how my son, although he's three,
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.740]   and let me just say, I overestimated three, y'all.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.340]   He is, whoo, he's perfect, but man, I'm stressing.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.460]   He does a lot of stuff, and I can never,
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.420]   I can't think of a reason that I would never love him.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.460]   Like, I would love him no matter what.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.520]   Like, he's great, but he's three, but he's great.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.380]   But then there's you guys who, I like you,
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.420]   but I'm sure there are things you can do
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.740]   to make me stop liking you real quick.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.100]   All right, some of you don't have to try that hard.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.140]   It's pretty easy for some.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.140]   But not with my kid, not with my family.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.480]   And God has this posture towards us.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.620]   That's why the ultimate blessing,
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.140]   the ultimate thing we can receive is not a gift,
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.780]   a Ferrari or a better job
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.660]   or a more stable relationship at home.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.140]   The ultimate gift we can get
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.900]   is to be brought back into his family.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.240]   That's what Emma was talking about.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.440]   By the blood of Jesus, we're not just forgiven,
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.560]   we're brought into his family.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.540]   This is how God intended humanity to be.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.060]   In relationship with him, heirs of his,
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.020]   made to be like him, protected by him, his children.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.660]   This is why Jesus in John three
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.160]   would speak to Nicodemus at night and he would say,
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.920]   "You must be, you must be born again.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.260]   "You must be born into this family
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.980]   "because if you are in this family,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.060]   "there is no sin that is deep enough
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.780]   "to separate me from you.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.740]   "When you're mine, you're mine,
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.460]   "and I will go through anything to get you back."
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.540]   And this story ultimately is illustrating
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.780]   that exact thing, the perks that come
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.860]   with being sons and daughters of God.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:17.820]   By repenting of our sins, by turning from our wrongdoings,
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.700]   as a child of God, know that you have access
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.720]   to the most extreme grace that there is.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.860]   Now, we've talked about two characters.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.340]   We've first looked at the crazy son,
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.020]   we've looked at the father and the grace
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.300]   that is just flowing from him,
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.340]   but there's a third character that we cannot overlook
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.320]   and the only way to really understand him
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.740]   is to understand the context of this parable.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.040]   This parable, it's something that maybe is good
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.340]   for all of us in our basic Bible reading
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.700]   and scripture studying.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.780]   It's always good to ask ourselves,
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.340]   how did we get to this point?
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.580]   Jesus might say something wild.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.900]   Ask yourself, what made him say that?
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.700]   I think if we ask ourselves this question in this parable,
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.060]   why is Jesus telling a parable about sons?
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.100]   What is he responding to?
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.220]   What is making him tell this story?
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.980]   If you look at Luke chapter 15 at verse two,
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.380]   you get this context of the Pharisees
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.200]   who are the religious leaders of the day,
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.740]   the tax collectors and sinners, the degenerates,
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.780]   the worst of society, all gather together
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.620]   around to hear Jesus and the Pharisees,
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.420]   the teachers of the law, they muttered,
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.020]   so not intended to be heard, to one another,
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.660]   they say this, this man welcomes sinners
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.660]   and eats with them.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.360]   This is our context.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:37.620]   The fact that Jesus, the one who does the big miracles,
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.540]   the one claiming to be the way, the truth and the life,
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.660]   this holy man is spending his time
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.380]   with the worst of society.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.980]   What's this guy really thinking?
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.620]   Like, can you be God and spend time with such filthy people,
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.980]   with the worst people, the cheaters, the liars,
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.340]   the prostitutes, the tax collectors, the thieves,
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.420]   the worst that society has to offer,
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.520]   yet Jesus is sharing meals, spending his time with them.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.980]   So they say something about it.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.260]   They don't have the courage to say it to Jesus,
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.460]   so they say it to one another, they mutter it,
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.860]   this man is hanging out with the worst people.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.580]   And in response to that, Jesus hears it,
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.780]   he knows their heart.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:16.140]   In response to that, he tells them this trilogy of parables,
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.820]   about coins, about sheep, and then ends with the big one
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.520]   about family, about the sons.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.720]   And I think it's interesting that this ending,
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.560]   the story that he tells, talks about a father,
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.320]   talks about the degenerate, it talks about the holy.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.400]   That's what the parable's about, right?
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.360]   The son, the father, and the other son.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.800]   The people in this room, there's Jesus,
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.640]   who claims to be God, the father.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.040]   There's the holy ones, the Pharisees,
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.200]   who know all the laws, who do everything right.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.920]   And then there's the tax collectors and the sinners.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.680]   See, there's the people in this room,
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.040]   and the sinners, see, there's a lesson
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.320]   Jesus wants us to see.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.440]   He's using this story to tell the Pharisees
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.720]   and the sinners about how God sees sinners.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   So that's something we can't afford to miss in this.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.200]   How does God see the sinner?
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.220]   When he's telling this story, I imagine that,
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.200]   you know, the crowd is expecting that if this son
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.240]   did this much damage, he takes his dad money and runs off.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.560]   When he comes back, they're probably expecting,
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.920]   he's probably not gonna get brought back into the family.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.480]   He's gonna get rebuked.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.280]   He's gonna get told off, get scolded, maybe lectured.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.560]   But Jesus is clever with his wording.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.240]   Jesus says that the father welcomes the son.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.600]   Well, what's the first accusation about what Jesus
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.080]   is doing in that moment?
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.980]   Back in chapter two, or in verse two,
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.280]   it says that they are annoyed and frustrated.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.960]   This man welcomes and eats with sinners.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.200]   In the story that Jesus tells, what happens?
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.760]   The father, this great man, welcomes back his son,
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.680]   puts the clothes and puts the robe
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.200]   and brings him back into the house, and then he does what?
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.480]   He takes them to lavash and they have a meal, right?
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.520]   They kill the fattened cow.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.640]   He welcomes and he eats in the story and in the accusation.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.520]   Jesus is being direct in story form.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.960]   He's providing groundbreaking revelation,
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.680]   making it clear that God is not just our creator.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.560]   He's not just powerful Yahweh, but he's father.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.320]   And how does he see the sinner?
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.360]   How does the father see the sinner?
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.620]   Well, this is where it's key.
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.520]   For the sinner who will come to their senses,
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.360]   who will recognize their sin,
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.960]   and who will just attempt to make his way back home,
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.320]   how does the father respond?
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:49.260]   With ridiculous grace, with extreme grace,
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.700]   going way beyond what you need, what you want,
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.180]   beyond forgiveness into restoration, he brings you back in.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.180]   Jesus tells this parable so that they would understand
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.740]   that if God comes down to earth,
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.140]   he's not hanging out with the holy people.
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.620]   When God comes down to earth, he's going for the lost.
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.340]   He's spending his time with those who are broken,
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.220]   those who are vulnerable.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.060]   He's not gonna be concerned about maintaining his privilege
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.660]   or his status as God.
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.020]   He's gonna be with those who are broken.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.220]   And if you think that God only cares for you
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.660]   if you do a good job with those who are within the church
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.060]   or those who have it right,
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.220]   then you might know the rules of God,
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.220]   but you don't know his heart.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.220]   That's what Jesus is saying in this parable.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.300]   It becomes so clear that the religious leaders,
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.380]   they don't actually know the father at all
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.740]   'cause they couldn't be more wrong
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.380]   about how he would respond.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.700]   And this is why because they are the religious leaders.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.900]   They set the climate, the temperature of what it means
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.460]   to be a follower of Yahweh, to have good spirituality.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.180]   And it's clear from this that they don't even know the father
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.220]   because they would see it as,
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.660]   well, we're Pharisees, these are sinners.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.220]   It would say in the Gospel of Matthew
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.740]   that Pharisees were very concerned about their status,
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.340]   about being upright, about they would dress a certain way
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.460]   when they went outside the streets.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.300]   They would pray in a certain voice,
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.100]   pretty loud to be heard when they fasted.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.980]   They were a bit dramatic about it,
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.300]   like soccer players and flopping.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.660]   They were like, oh, I'm fasting,
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.860]   making sure everyone knew that they were fasting.
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.220]   They were all about the image and the appearance.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.300]   Well, Jesus is contrasting himself with them
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.820]   because just like the Pharisees,
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.460]   Jesus sees that these are tax collectors.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.780]   He knows.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.500]   He knows that Matthew was cheating people from their money.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.460]   He knew about Zachariah's problem.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.020]   He knows that they're prostitutes.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.620]   He knows their sin.
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.460]   Think back to John four, the woman at the well.
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.460]   He knows that she has multiple husbands, right?
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.300]   But what does he do?
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.700]   His privilege of being God
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.820]   does not stop him from coming close.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.660]   Hear that.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.660]   Because he's God doesn't mean he won't come close to our mess.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:59.860]   Jesus would spin this story around
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.540]   telling of a prodigal son
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.820]   and telling of the position of our attitudes
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.980]   and the attitude of the older brother
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.980]   as being most clearly reflected in that of the Pharisees
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.860]   who are, get this,
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.340]   kind of just when you think about it like this,
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.420]   it creates, drives me,
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.980]   the Pharisees are holding Jesus's compassion against him.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.540]   That's a hard way to look at it.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.740]   Because he's so compassionate, they're angry.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.300]   And this is exactly what you see in that final brother,
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.140]   that last kid.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.540]   That's why you have to know the context.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.420]   Because of Jesus' compassion, they're angry.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.460]   Well, look at that older brother, what happens with him?
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.860]   He's angry that the younger brother
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.220]   who's been reckless and wild,
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.420]   whose life has been falling apart,
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.140]   comes back home and the father throws his arms over him,
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.580]   gives him all this stuff, gives him the fatted calf,
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.780]   celebrates and is rejoicing with him.
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:57.580]   The older son and the Pharisees share the same perspective.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.940]   And as I studied this,
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.000]   I knew there were a lot of obvious points to make,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.060]   but there was something that hit me for the first time.
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.020]   So the way the story goes is that the younger brother,
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.020]   when he gets what he wants from dad,
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.740]   he runs to a different land, right?
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.120]   He goes far, far away, like Jethro going far away.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.100]   The older brother says,
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.620]   I stayed in your house the whole time.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.460]   I was close to you.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.340]   I was always obeying you, doing exactly what you wanted.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.580]   So how then does the older brother
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.660]   who has stayed close to the father
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.720]   know the details of the sin of the younger brother?
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.820]   The younger brother was in a distant land.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.900]   The older brother stayed close to dad.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.740]   It's easy to say that, right?
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:34.820]   I've stayed close to you.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.460]   I've done what you're supposed to do.
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.740]   How does he know what the brother is doing?
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.900]   Has he hired a spy?
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.520]   Does he have a scouting report on what his brother's doing?
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.680]   How is he aware?
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.520]   I mean, because you would think
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.340]   that to be in the father's house,
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.040]   your focus would be on the father.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.300]   Hear that?
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.260]   See, the older brother is more focused
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.980]   on gathering a report of what the younger brother
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.020]   has done wrong.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.260]   He has, maybe he's remained in the house,
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.860]   but he has not abided in the father
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.900]   because the father is compassionate,
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.380]   whereas the older brother is judgmental.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.900]   While in the father's house,
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.660]   focused on the wrongdoings of others.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.600]   This is the heart of the Pharisees.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.820]   This is the way that they naturally found themselves.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.320]   But I think we have to be careful
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:19.260]   because sometimes this can be us.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.860]   This can be you and me sitting in this room.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.620]   I think we have to ask ourselves these questions regularly.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.060]   Are we becoming more like Christ in his love
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.100]   for the broken, for the worst of humanity,
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.380]   or becoming more self-righteous?
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.620]   We just wanna see them get what they deserve.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.300]   Before we dismiss it quickly,
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.540]   because no one likes the title of self-righteousness,
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.240]   remember this, the Pharisees had all the laws memorized.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.080]   They did it all right.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.460]   They were the ones who prayed with the best words,
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.040]   and they were the ones who fasted regularly,
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.220]   and they had memorized the first five books of the Bible.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.220]   I mean, they got it, they understood it.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.760]   They were like the pastors of the day.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.820]   I think we can come in every Sunday,
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.660]   and we can raise our hands during worship,
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.900]   or clap when Emma starts talking about the blood of Jesus.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.740]   You know, amen.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.260]   We can take our phones out and take a photo
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.020]   when there's a tweetable line in the sermon,
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.800]   but does that mean anything?
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:15.660]   Because that's not the indicator
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.020]   of the transition that we have to be going through,
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.020]   of the transformation that God really intends
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.340]   for those of us who remain here with him.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:30.060]   To be offended by God's heart for the lost.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.260]   This is their attitude, even though they do everything right.
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.260]   And I think we've gotta be careful
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.340]   to make sure that just because we come,
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.280]   we don't end up in that place,
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.060]   looking at, oh, God, I've done all these things,
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.340]   and they've done nothing.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.660]   We don't wanna be those kinds of people.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.300]   I don't want us to be those kind of people.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.360]   Our proximity to Christ isn't a badge we wear
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.300]   that makes us better than other people.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.640]   It's not.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.740]   It's not our permission to point and say,
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.540]   look how bad they're doing.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.260]   Doesn't give us a right to get online
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.780]   and blast everyone that's not a Christian
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.540]   for the ridiculous things that they might do.
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.260]   Guess what, they're not Christians.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.100]   Imagine that.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:13.140]   No, our proximity to God is meant to draw us close to him
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.260]   so that we can be transformed by him.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.880]   Being close to God is less about being holier than others.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.120]   It's more about becoming like him,
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.820]   becoming extreme in our grace,
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:29.260]   choosing compassion over judgment,
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.700]   oozing with compassion.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.120]   When our brothers and sisters are lost,
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.940]   being excited to see them come home,
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.540]   co-laboring with the Father.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.700]   That's my heart for me, my family.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.760]   That's my heart for us as a community.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.540]   That in our weekly gatherings,
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.500]   in the gatherings that take place outside of Sundays here,
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.420]   that we would be growing in our likeness of God.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.720]   That our hearts would be becoming softer
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.220]   and being more like his.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.940]   That he would replace the heart of stone
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.960]   and give us a heart of flesh.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.200]   That he would wipe away the scales from our eyes,
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.420]   and we would see people the way that he sees them,
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.900]   being shaped like him.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.180]   That we would be broken for the loss,
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.100]   the way that he's broken for the loss.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.000]   And that we would rejoice when they come home.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.700]   We would rejoice when they repent.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.780]   And for me, where I find this most challenging,
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.260]   I have to ask myself this.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:23.260]   Would I be rejoicing, celebrating,
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.460]   and the worst person that I know,
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.240]   most filthy person that I know,
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.480]   the liar, the cheater,
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.820]   the one who's weaseled their way, who's offended me,
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.100]   comes into God's family,
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.300]   and he gets the exact same privilege as I do.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.540]   Can I celebrate at that?
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.580]   Because I think it's that what drives the son crazy.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.100]   It's not just that he's forgiven.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.140]   It's that he's now restored to the same level.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.760]   And that blood of Jesus, like Emma said,
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.860]   that is our ultimate equalizer.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.260]   That's what makes us all be able to be
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.980]   on the same level again.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.220]   And that's what the father is ultimately showing us
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.220]   through all of this.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.160]   Now, with all this repentance and grace,
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.820]   I think there's one last question
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.460]   that I want us to kind of wrestle with a little bit
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.820]   before we get to a closing point.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:13.820]   See, what do you think those who were sinning,
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.180]   those who were the sinners,
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:17.380]   Jesus was having dinner with them, right?
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.920]   What do you think they were thinking?
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.680]   How do you think they felt when the holy teacher, Jesus,
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.880]   talks about God welcoming sinners?
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.740]   What do you think their feelings were in that moment?
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.820]   Because they would be well acquainted with their sins.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.900]   They know where they've fallen short.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.860]   I wonder if when they hear that the father welcomes back,
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.660]   kills the shattered calf,
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.900]   puts the ring on the arm, on the finger,
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:48.020]   I wonder if maybe goosebumps happened, you know?
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.260]   I wonder if like they might have gotten choked up
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.500]   a little bit, maybe a lump in their throat,
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.920]   maybe a little heavy breathing.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.600]   Because to know that God is going to respond
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.360]   with such grace if we repent can be liberating.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.400]   It can lead us to actual repentance.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.420]   I think this is what Jesus is trying to show us
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.960]   with this whole story.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.340]   Could it be that by learning of the father's posture
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.240]   for restoring those who are lost,
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.620]   some of their hearts are softened?
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.600]   Could that be the same for us?
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.080]   That if you ask yourself this,
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.840]   if you could really understand
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.440]   that no matter what it is that you've done,
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.240]   it doesn't matter how bad it is, I mean the worst thing,
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.800]   if you were to have a come to your senses moment,
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.920]   if we were just to turn,
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.400]   remember you don't have to have it all right yet,
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.200]   if we were just to start that journey back home,
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.280]   the father doesn't just say,
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.440]   "Good job, thanks for not sinning anymore."
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.400]   He rejoices, like joy, happiness, celebration,
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.480]   let's throw a party, that's his response.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.760]   The scriptures would say that the angels in heaven
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.500]   are celebrating over this.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.680]   I wonder if we could get that.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.320]   How would that impact our desire
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.300]   or our courage to actually repent?
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.620]   Oftentimes repentance is seen as this doom and gloom thing.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.120]   What this shows is that repentance
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.640]   is something that's met with joy.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.600]   We don't have to be all serious and sad when we repent.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.120]   We come back to God and he's excited to have us.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.920]   He loves us, overflowing with joy.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.600]   If we understand that repentance is a joyful moment,
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   would we dare repent more?
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.400]   Could it be something that we would do regularly?
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.160]   'Cause here's the thing, this is what Satan's trying to do.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.300]   Here's the big picture, go back to Genesis for a second.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.560]   When Adam and Eve sin in the garden,
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.000]   they take the buyer of the apple,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.800]   they recognize that they're naked, and what do they do?
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.520]   They hide.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.320]   They distance themselves.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.160]   They separate, sin separates us from God,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.360]   but this is what grace does.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.520]   Grace says that if you would come to your senses,
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.320]   if you would put your faith in Jesus,
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.080]   if you would understand that he is the way,
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.040]   the truth, and the life,
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.520]   if you would just make an effort to come towards him,
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.200]   you don't have to get it all right,
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.480]   but if you would just take a step, he'll meet you.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:16.480]   He'll sprint towards you, and he will be so glad.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.520]   Not just to forgive,
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.840]   but to make you a part of the family again,
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.680]   to make you an heir, someone who gets things from him,
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.960]   someone who is loved by him,
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.380]   someone who is protected by him, taken care of by him.
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:34.000]   Guys, I pray this is something that we can understand
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.840]   and fully get.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.440]   I pray that the courage needed
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.880]   from an understanding of the extreme grace of the Father
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.680]   would find its way to you,
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.540]   because repentance is a bit of an invitation.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.980]   It's God making it clear that you're welcomed back
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.700]   and you're wanted back.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.220]   So I think we all need to keep this in mind.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.560]   You're wanted.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.920]   God wants you in his family.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.260]   If he didn't, he would just forgive you
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.540]   and let you on your way,
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.060]   but he wants you to be a part of that family.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.880]   He wants you to be under that covering,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.160]   under that protection.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.900]   He desires to see you not just forgiven of your sin.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.940]   John 3, 16, "For God so hated sin
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:14.780]   "that he came into the world."
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.660]   No, for God so loved the world.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.200]   His posture is love towards you.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.520]   He desires to see you flourish, to see you at peace,
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.240]   to see you the way that he's intended your life to be.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:32.500]   And that takes place when we're able to turn from our sins.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.060]   Here, I wanna leave us with this.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.540]   As the worship team makes their way up,
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.220]   there is one of my favorite C.S. Lewis quotes,
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.740]   and if you don't know who C.S. Lewis is,
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.980]   Ananias series is incredible, please read it.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.780]   It'll enrich your life.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.540]   But Lewis, in one of his books called
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.420]   "The Screwtape Letters," which is a book
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.980]   where demons are writing letters to Satan about people.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.200]   Very wild, very crazy, but very insightful.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.300]   This one demon is writing,
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:07.300]   and he says this about the human effort,
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:12.580]   about the divine satisfaction and love.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.740]   And it is profound and it blows my mind
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:15.740]   and it stays with me.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:16.740]   I've written songs about it.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.280]   I've talked about it all the time.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.860]   I wanna leave you guys with it
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.940]   'cause I hope it can help you.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.720]   It says this, "He," meaning the father,
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.160]   "He wants them," meaning us,
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.900]   "He wants them to learn how to walk
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.640]   "and must therefore take away his hands.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.980]   "And if only the will to walk is really there,
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:48.860]   "he is pleased," get this, "even in their stumbles."
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:54.640]   Guys, for lots of us, it won't be a clean walk home.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.200]   For lots of us, it will be stumbles.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.620]   It's not an easy route back,
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.420]   but here's the thing, the heavy lifting is done by him.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.460]   He's gonna carry you through.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.720]   He's your strength.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.760]   He is the rock that you build your hope on.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.200]   He is your strong tower.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.400]   He is your ever present help in times of need
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.000]   and in times where you don't realize that you have need.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.360]   Even in our stumbles, he will be pleased
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.580]   and he will be with us.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.520]   So God, we come to you this morning
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:32.520]   and we recognize and are overwhelmed by your grace,
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:37.160]   by your extreme fervent love,
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   by love so extreme that it welcomes in the sinner.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.680]   It welcomes in those of us who are Christians
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.120]   and who have made such terrible mistakes
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.380]   that we're afraid to come to you.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.040]   It welcomes, it dines with, it reinstates,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.500]   and it restores us.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.080]   So Holy Spirit, there are so many lies
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.060]   and so many fears about being judged by God,
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.140]   but to the one who would return,
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:10.820]   there is this truth that your love should cast out our fear,
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.080]   that your love is enough,
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.200]   that the blood of Jesus runs deeper
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.640]   than anything your child or children could do.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.200]   And so God, help us not just believe it,
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.560]   but Holy Spirit, would you put that as a seed into our heart
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.000]   and would you keep that soil fertile so this grows in us
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.020]   into a tree of understanding that you want us
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.120]   and you welcome us.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.240]   And no matter what we've done,
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.140]   if the thief on the cross could get in at the last minute,
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.440]   it doesn't matter what we've done,
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.720]   if we would turn to you,
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:51.320]   we will find hope, we will find a father
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.880]   who isn't waiting to beat us, but who is overjoyed.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.000]   God, for those of us who feel distant,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.200]   who feel like we can't talk to you
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.280]   'cause our sin is so bad, I rebuke that lie.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.420]   Holy Spirit, would you come in and speak your truth?
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.620]   Would you remind that light shines best in darkness,
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.120]   that you came not to be served, but to serve us,
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.900]   that those of us who are sick,
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.800]   those of us who are in need of you,
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.500]   that's who you came for.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.620]   Lord, would you open our hearts,
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.460]   lead us to that coming to our senses moment
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:31.340]   and give us the courage to turn our hearts,
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.900]   our minds, our postures, and our will back to you.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.660]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.240]   (gentle music)
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.820]   (gentle music)
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.880]   you
