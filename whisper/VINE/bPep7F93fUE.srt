1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 When I was a teenager, I used to skate.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,560
 So, I was skateboarding.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,740
 Now, that didn't last that long, because I kept falling,

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,200
 especially when I started trying to do, like, half pipes,

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,300
 quarter pipes, that sort of thing,

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,900
 and I ended up having a blue spot that was like,

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,100
 you know, like a little half a pizza on my side,

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,760
 and I decided, maybe this is not what I'm meant to do.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,040
 But while I was still into street skating and all of that,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,800
 I needed to buy a part for my skateboard.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,960
 So, I went to the skate shop.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,700
 They had the part that I needed.

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,040
 I went to pay with my 10 German marks.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,900
 So, this also shows that this was a long time ago,

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,900
 and the cashier gave me a change for 100 German marks.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,540
 Now, let me put this in Hong Kong equivalents.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,700
 So, I gave 100 Hong Kong dollars

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,440
 and was expecting about 50 Hong Kong dollars back,

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,860
 and the cashier thought that I gave him 1,000 Hong Kong dollars

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,200
 and gave me 950 Hong Kong dollars back.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
 So, I took the money.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,060
 I was like, "This is amazing.

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,340
 The Lord works in mysterious ways.

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,740
 Praise God."

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,360
 You don't believe me, right?

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,500
 Or maybe. No.

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,340
 That's not what I did, but I was tempted to do it.

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,300
 I wanted to keep the money.

29
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,960
 So, this was that much money at that time.

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,240
 So, you can imagine, actually, by now,

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,340
 it probably doubled the amount of that money

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,940
 in terms of what you can purchase with that.

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,340
 And so, we all, you know, at one point or another,

34
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,140
 in different ways, for me as a teenager,

35
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,000
 it was a temptation to keep it and keep my mouth shut

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,800
 and take the money, but we all face temptations.

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,960
 And they're different for different people.

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,960
 It's easy to look at somebody else and say,

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,300
 "Oh, you're tempted with the money."

40
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,800
 Then, "Oh," you know, like, that's --

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,900
 Why would you be tempted with that?

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,100
 That doesn't impact me whatsoever.

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,400
 But we all have areas where we actually do struggle

44
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,140
 with our sinful nature, where we want to do things

45
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,340
 that we know are not right.

46
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,460
 We know they're not good,

47
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,560
 but we find ourselves sometimes doing them anyhow.

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,060
 And so, for some of us, maybe that has to do with money.

49
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,060
 Maybe it has to do with business,

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,360
 getting ahead in your business,

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
 cutting corners, not paying taxes.

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
 For others, maybe it has to do with relationships.

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
 Maybe we have an affair.

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,360
 Maybe we have an emotional affair,

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,700
 where we have emotional intimacy

56
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,960
 with somebody other than our spouse.

57
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,560
 So this is something that happens quite often.

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,760
 Of course, that, then, a lot of times,

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,000
 does lead to a full-fledged affair, as well.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,100
 For others, it might be maybe there's drinking.

61
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,800
 Maybe we drink alcohol,

62
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,400
 and then we're tempted to just drink more.

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,500
 Maybe it's pornography.

64
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,200
 Maybe it is gambling.

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,920
 You know, so we all have different things.

66
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,000
 You can fill in the blank.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,660
 I think we know the type of things

68
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,860
 where we feel that temptation.

69
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,100
 And this is also true for us as Christians.

70
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,600
 We also still face these temptations.

71
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,220
 We also sometimes have these strong urges and feelings

72
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,460
 coming upon ourselves,

73
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,500
 where we want to do the things

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,800
 that we know are not right,

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,420
 that we know are not good,

76
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,960
 that are destructive, a lot of times, to ourselves

77
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,160
 and to those whom we love.

78
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,400
 So what I want to do with you today through this message,

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,000
 I want to explore with you a question.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,900
 And the question is this.

81
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,020
 How can we be led by the Spirit

82
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,100
 and live lives that honor God?

83
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,460
 You know, how can we rely on the Holy Spirit's power

84
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:42,120
 to strengthen us, to overcome our sinful desires,

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,220
 and not give in to them?

86
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,600
 You know, how do you do that?

87
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,000
 What does that look like?

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,420
 So that's what we're going to explore.

89
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,520
 We are continuing in our sermon series

90
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,020
 through the Book of Galatians.

91
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,680
 Let me set the context for a passage.

92
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,220
 So Paul, he has been proclaiming the gospel.

93
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,320
 And there's been a group of agitators,

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,280
 or we've called them rival missionaries,

95
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,080
 who came in after him

96
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,480
 and who challenged the gospel that he preached.

97
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,140
 Now, one of the things that they challenged about the gospel

98
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,600
 is that they said it doesn't lead to holy living.

99
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,900
 It doesn't lead to true righteousness.

100
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,160
 How can a gospel where we're forgiven by grace,

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,240
 you know, through faith, end up leading to a holy life?

102
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,440
 Doesn't that just give permission to sin?

103
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,340
 Because we know God's going to show us grace

104
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,100
 and forgiveness anyhow.

105
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,560
 So they're attacking his gospel

106
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
 and the ethics of that gospel.

107
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,440
 You know, what does that lead to?

108
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,340
 And that's why they're emphasizing the observing

109
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,760
 of the Mosaic Law and all the rules and do's and don'ts

110
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,100
 and trying to earn and be righteous through that.

111
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,700
 But here in our passage today, as we're going to see,

112
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,940
 Paul shows us that it is the Spirit of God within us

113
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,740
 who brings about the true righteous life

114
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,600
 and true holiness

115
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,500
 and who turns us and transforms us into people

116
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,400
 who can say no to our sinful nature, to our temptations,

117
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
 and be people who reflect his character.

118
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,000
 So let me turn with you to Galatians 5,

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,400
 and starting in verse 16, it says this.

120
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,500
 "So I say, live by the Spirit,

121
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,160
 and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.

122
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,900
 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit,

123
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,200
 and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.

124
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,400
 They are in conflict with each other

125
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,060
 so that you are not to do whatever you want.

126
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,320
 But if you are led by the Spirit,

127
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,420
 you are not under the law.

128
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,200
 The acts of the flesh are obvious.

129
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,600
 Sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery,

130
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,960
 idolatry and witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy,

131
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,320
 fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissension, factions,

132
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,200
 and envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like.

133
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,400
 I warn you, as I did before,

134
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,960
 that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.

135
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,560
 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance"

136
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,660
 also translated as patience,

137
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,160
 "kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control

138
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,420
 against such thing there is no law.

139
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,600
 Those who belong to Christ Jesus

140
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,920
 have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

141
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,720
 Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.

142
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,900
 Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other."

143
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,360
 So what Paul does here, he holds up this picture before the Galatians.

144
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,960
 He holds up what's known as a vice list,

145
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,360
 where it lists all the acts of the flesh.

146
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,560
 And it's just an example, so it doesn't mean that's it.

147
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
 There's more stuff to it,

148
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,160
 but it's just probably specifically also targeted at the Galatians.

149
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,760
 Maybe that's some of the things he knows what's going on.

150
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,160
 And then the other one is he lists the fruit of the Spirit,

151
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,960
 the holiness, the righteousness, the character of Jesus

152
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,060
 that the Holy Spirit produced in our lives.

153
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,060
 So he holds that up to the Galatian Christians.

154
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,360
 And I want to look with you at both of them.

155
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,260
 So we're going to start with the acts of the flesh.

156
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,760
 But before I unpack that more,

157
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,060
 I actually want to talk about the word "flesh."

158
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,060
 Now, "flesh" for us, you know, just means, in English, means this.

159
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,560
 And that also means this in God's Word and in the Bible.

160
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,360
 It also means human body.

161
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,960
 But it also means our fallen, sinful human nature.

162
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,060
 So a lot of times when Paul talks about the flesh,

163
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,560
 that's what he's referring to, our fallen, sinful human nature,

164
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,660
 our inclination to do things that are not right and that don't please God.

165
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,460
 And so that's what "sarx" or "flesh," what that Greek word means.

166
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,160
 But let's look at this list that Paul gives us.

167
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,560
 So I'm going to read it again. It's verse 19.

168
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,760
 He says, "The acts of the flesh are obvious.

169
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,560
 Sexual morality, impurity, debauchery,

170
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,660
 idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,

171
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,260
 selfish ambition, dissension, faction, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like."

172
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,160
 So he just lays it all out there.

173
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,460
 And there's 15 things that he lists.

174
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,560
 And we can break those down into, like, three general categories.

175
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,060
 So let me share those categories with you.

176
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,860
 The first one is disunity.

177
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,960
 The second one is personal.

178
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,460
 And the third one is spiritual boundary crossing.

179
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,560
 So I want to unpack that a little bit.

180
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,760
 So when it talks about disunity, you know, these vices being in there,

181
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,460
 it means things like hatred, discord, jealousy, and on.

182
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,660
 And basically, that's the temptation, we're tempted within us to be,

183
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,760
 to bring separation between us and people.

184
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,460
 It's like actions that break down relationships

185
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,760
 because we cannot help to, you know, pursue our selfish things,

186
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,860
 but actually it's hurtful to other people.

187
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,560
 Like, that would be me when I was, if I would have taken the money from the cashier,

188
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,260
 then in the evening, you would have to count, "Why is all this money missing?"

189
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,460
 You know, would have raised some questions.

190
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,060
 So my selfishness would have impacted, you know, him.

191
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,560
 And so what these acts of the flesh do, they break down relationships.

192
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,360
 That's what sin does.

193
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,360
 It breaks down relationships between us and other people.

194
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,860
 And I think we can see that even if we just follow politics, right, around the world,

195
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,560
 whether the US election or, we can see there's a lot of acting in the flesh

196
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,960
 where there's just a breakdown of relationship

197
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,160
 and of how people relate to each other in that.

198
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,060
 So that's the first one, the temptations of the flesh,

199
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,360
 they lead us to this unity and to breakdown of relationship.

200
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,160
 The second one is personal, where the flesh tempts us to just say to ourselves,

201
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,560
 "Oh, it's okay, just indulge a little bit more in that.

202
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,760
 It's okay to drink a little bit more of that wine,

203
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,060
 even though you already had a bottle and a half.

204
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,560
 You know, just drink a little bit more.

205
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,060
 You know, it's okay to watch pornography.

206
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
 You know, you deserve it.

207
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,260
 Just relax and enjoy."

208
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,060
 So that's how the flesh tempts us.

209
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,060
 And so we personally indulge in things.

210
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,760
 And initially, those things feel good.

211
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
 Otherwise, we wouldn't do it.

212
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
 We're not stupid, right?

213
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,960
 We do things because initially they feel good.

214
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,660
 They do give pleasure, some pleasure.

215
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,460
 But in the end, they are also destructive to ourselves.

216
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,060
 They hurt ourselves.

217
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,860
 And a lot of times, they also end up hurting other people as well.

218
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:03,260
 And so that's a personal, you know, acts of the flesh that have a personal impact.

219
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,660
 And then the final one is spiritual boundary crossing.

220
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,060
 So that has to do with witchcraft, with idolatry.

221
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,660
 What that means is, like, you're just, you're a Christian,

222
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:23,360
 but there is a temptation that you believe maybe God cannot fully deliver.

223
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,960
 So I need to hedge my bets.

224
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,360
 So I'm not just going to trust God,

225
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,860
 but I'm also going to go to the fortune teller about my love life.

226
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,060
 And I'm going to ask him to, you know, help me and give me some insights

227
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,260
 so I can receive whoever it is that I'm meant to be with.

228
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,660
 Or it might be, like, maybe you do some sort of ritual

229
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,160
 so that more cash comes flowing in, you know,

230
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,560
 that we can receive, you know, all the blessings and everything, whatever.

231
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,960
 And you guys know, some of you know this even better than me,

232
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,660
 you know, all these things.

233
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,060
 But basically, all of this is rooted in a lack of trust in God,

234
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,060
 that God truly loves you, that he can truly provide for you,

235
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,560
 that he will truly, will be faithful to you.

236
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,660
 I've been saying that he will truly come through for you.

237
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,660
 And so we do these other things on the side.

238
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,260
 But the problem is that the source of these things is evil.

239
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,660
 It's Satan. It's demonic.

240
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,560
 And as Christians, we should not be crossing this boundary.

241
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,560
 But sometimes we do.

242
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,960
 But whenever we do, a lot of times evil leads to fear in our lives

243
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,660
 and just, we give evil a foothold in our lives.

244
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,760
 And so we don't want to do that.

245
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,860
 So those are the acts of the flesh.

246
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,860
 And so Paul is holding us up before the Galatians.

247
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,960
 And we can see that this represents the power of the flesh

248
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,560
 to bring out the worst in our lives.

249
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,660
 You know, just really brings destruction in our personal lives and to others as well.

250
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,560
 So that's the first thing.

251
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,360
 But then Paul also holds up the fruit of the Spirit.

252
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,160
 And so let's look at those in verse 22 and 23.

253
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,660
 It says this, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,

254
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,360
 forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

255
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
 Against such things there is no law."

256
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
 So Paul holds up the ninefold fruit.

257
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,060
 And I want to briefly talk about those.

258
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,560
 At some point in time, maybe we'll do a sermon series on that.

259
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,660
 That would be fun.

260
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,560
 No guarantees.

261
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,260
 But as I was looking at this, I was like, "Oh, that would be interesting to unpack all of those."

262
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,260
 But let me just briefly touch on each of them.

263
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,860
 So love is not some sentimental feeling, you know, that the Spirit produces in us,

264
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:46,260
 but it's actually the self-giving, sacrificial love towards others that looks like Jesus

265
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,960
 because we care about the welfare, the flourishing, and the thriving of others.

266
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,560
 So it's a self-giving love.

267
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,160
 So that's the fruit of love.

268
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,860
 That's the Spirit of God working in us.

269
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,560
 The second one is joy.

270
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,860
 Joy is not dependent on our circumstances.

271
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,060
 It's not happiness that if our circumstances are good, we're happy.

272
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,860
 If they're bad, we're not.

273
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,060
 Joy depends on who God is.

274
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,160
 And we can have joy and experience joy even in painful moments in our lives

275
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,860
 because God is with us.

276
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,860
 He's faithful.

277
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,860
 He loves us.

278
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,860
 We can know His promises.

279
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,860
 We can know His presence even in the midst of a very difficult experience.

280
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,960
 And the Holy Spirit can give us joy in Him.

281
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,160
 And then peace.

282
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,860
 We have peace with God

283
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,060
 because of what Jesus has done.

284
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,860
 There is a broken relationship between us and God,

285
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,260
 but because of His sacrifice on the cross,

286
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,360
 He has brought us in a relationship with God.

287
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,160
 And so now we have peace with God,

288
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,460
 whereas before when we don't know Jesus, we actually had enmity with God.

289
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
 But then it's not only that.

290
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,160
 We also have the peace of God

291
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,960
 where God gives us peace that He is sovereign.

292
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,160
 Regardless of what's going on in our lives,

293
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,760
 we can trust in Him because He's sovereign.

294
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,860
 He will bring us through.

295
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,260
 He will see us through.

296
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,760
 And so we can also have peace in the midst of very difficult circumstances.

297
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,860
 Say, "I'm going to trust God because He's for me.

298
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,160
 He's not against me."

299
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,660
 We're talking about earlier in worship.

300
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,260
 And so, and of course, it also has to do with being,

301
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,360
 that we become peacemakers as well,

302
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,160
 where we bring the peace of God to others

303
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,560
 and we work towards the peace that God wants to bring.

304
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,960
 Then there's patience or forbearance.

305
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,560
 I actually like the translation "patience" more.

306
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,060
 So we talked about that a few Sundays ago

307
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:45,360
 where it was that Paul was being patient with the Galatians

308
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,560
 who were hating on him.

309
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,260
 They had turned on him.

310
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,560
 They saw him, they used to be friends, they used to be close,

311
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,060
 and then they saw him as an enemy.

312
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,960
 But Paul remained patiently working with them,

313
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,660
 not saying, "Forget you," and walking away,

314
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,260
 but continuing to pour his heart out

315
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,360
 because he wanted to see Christ fully formed in them.

316
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,360
 And I said in that message, I said that Paul was fighting for them,

317
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,760
 for their well-being, for their flourishing,

318
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,560
 while they were fighting him.

319
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,160
 So patience means we can be long-suffering.

320
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,260
 We can endure things and still do good despite of what's happening.

321
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,960
 But it also means, and that's where the forbearance part comes in,

322
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,560
 forbearance means that we can forgive and overlook sins

323
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
 that others commit against us.

324
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,660
 And so that's also the fruit of the Spirit in our lives

325
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,260
 that we're able to be patient,

326
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,460
 that we're able to show forbearance to others.

327
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,460
 Then there's kindness.

328
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,560
 God's Word says it's His kindness that leads us to repentance.

329
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,760
 It's His love, His mercy and grace.

330
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,760
 And so He also wants to bring about that same kindness in us

331
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,060
 so we can turn around and show that to other people.

332
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,960
 There is goodness, which is generosity.

333
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,260
 God is so generous.

334
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,160
 We sometimes say when we talk about our offering,

335
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,060
 as the fruit of the Spirit in our lives grows,

336
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,860
 because God is generous, we want to be generous people,

337
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,060
 generous with love, generous with grace,

338
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,860
 generous with our time, generous with our finances.

339
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,260
 Because when we're generous, we reflect the character of God.

340
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,060
 And so that is another fruit that God produces in our lives.

341
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,560
 Then there's faithfulness.

342
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,860
 The Holy Spirit makes us faithful people,

343
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,860
 faithful to other people,

344
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,560
 faithful to God.

345
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,160
 Then there's gentleness.

346
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,260
 It's a humility.

347
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,560
 It's being humble and treating other people gently.

348
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,360
 Also has a ring of that patience where we gently work,

349
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,760
 maybe to restore someone,

350
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,460
 and we don't treat them harshly.

351
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,160
 And then finally there is self-control.

352
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,460
 And self-control actually enables us

353
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,160
 not to carry out the acts of the flesh,

354
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,360
 because God brings about the fruit of self-control in our lives,

355
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,660
 where we're able to say no to whatever we're being tempted with.

356
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,860
 And so this is the fruit of the Spirit that Paul holds up.

357
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,460
 So if you look at those nine fruits,

358
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,560
 or its fruit, ninefold fruit,

359
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,860
 it's so hard to not use the plural.

360
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,160
 If you look at the ninefold fruit,

361
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,060
 it really looks like Jesus.

362
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,660
 It's a character of God that he wants to work out in our lives

363
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,060
 and bring about in our lives.

364
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,160
 And I don't know about you,

365
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,460
 but having these things grow in our lives,

366
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,760
 wouldn't that be amazing to see them unfold more and more and more and more?

367
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,160
 Man, I would love that,

368
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,460
 to look more and more like that.

369
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,960
 I'm sure you would as well.

370
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,760
 So Paul holds up the acts of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit,

371
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,160
 and he basically is asking the Galatians, "Well, look at this.

372
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,360
 Who are you looking more like?

373
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,460
 What does your life look like?

374
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,060
 What does your community's life look like more?

375
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,460
 Is it one where there's fighting and where there's division

376
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,160
 and there's hatred and there's indulgence and all sorts of things?

377
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,660
 Or is it a community where there is sacrificial love towards one another,

378
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,260
 where there's gentleness, there's kindness,

379
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,660
 there's goodness displayed in that?"

380
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:30,060
 And so he's challenging the Galatians to be led by the Spirit,

381
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,560
 to walk with the Spirit.

382
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,560
 Because just because we have the Holy Spirit within us

383
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:44,060
 doesn't mean that we always surrender and open to his work in our lives.

384
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,860
 Now all of this, this tension,

385
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,860
 and honestly, if we ourselves look at that list,

386
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,660
 we can probably see things on the acts of the flesh list

387
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,060
 in ourselves as well from time to time,

388
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,960
 where we know that is still part of our lives.

389
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,560
 And so this points that there is actually a tension,

390
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,560
 there's a conflict, a battle around your heart,

391
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,760
 around your mind, around your thoughts, around your action.

392
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,260
 And that is true for every Christian.

393
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,360
 So I want to talk about that more.

394
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,660
 So let's go to looking at that.

395
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,560
 And we see that in Galatians 5, 16 through 18, and it says this,

396
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,360
 "So I say, live by the Spirit,

397
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,360
 and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.

398
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,360
 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit,

399
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,260
 and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.

400
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,260
 They are in conflict with each other,

401
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,460
 so that you are not to do whatever you want.

402
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,860
 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."

403
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,860
 So Paul puts the live by the Spirit

404
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,660
 in opposition to the gratifying the desires of the flesh.

405
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,760
 And so it's important to recognize,

406
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,260
 you know, we've been talking about is that,

407
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,060
 because Jesus has come,

408
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,160
 and when we place our faith in Jesus,

409
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,860
 He breaks the power of sin in our lives.

410
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,460
 We are no longer enslaved to sin.

411
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,760
 The victory has been won.

412
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,460
 But it doesn't mean that there are still battles that we fight.

413
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,360
 And so, with the help of my wife,

414
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,360
 I created a chart, so I want to show you that.

415
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,060
 And I was inspired from another chart,

416
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,360
 but I don't know the source of that,

417
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,760
 or I couldn't find that, but let's look at that.

418
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,660
 So here you see the...

419
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,760
 Actually, let me go to the side here.

420
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,360
 Well, that doesn't really help.

421
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
 It's like I need to, I need to like...

422
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,560
 Whoa, I need to like stand like right here, right?

423
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,960
 Stand in the middle. Okay, there we go.

424
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,060
 But I can't see it.

425
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:41,260
 Okay, so we have the life apart from Jesus.

426
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,760
 You know, sin has power over us.

427
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,260
 We're in chains.

428
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,660
 We are not free.

429
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,860
 We give in, you know, to our sinful nature,

430
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,460
 and we live in that sin.

431
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,360
 And our flesh draws us away from God.

432
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,160
 You know, so you really have this force working this way

433
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,360
 that it wants to separate us from God,

434
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
 and we are living in separation of God.

435
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,260
 So that is our condition.

436
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,660
 But then when we become Christian,

437
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,460
 when we have life with Jesus,

438
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,260
 one thing that happens is that the Holy Spirit

439
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,460
 comes into our hearts.

440
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,660
 Now, biblically, the heart,

441
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,360
 it's most of the time in the New Testament talks about it's metaphorical.

442
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,860
 So it's a place where decisions are made.

443
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,060
 It's also where our spiritual life takes place,

444
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:31,360
 our doubts, our faithfulness,

445
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,460
 and also our decisions.

446
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,360
 Our faith happens in the heart.

447
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,860
 And so now we find ourselves,

448
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,860
 yes, there are still forces that are drawing us away from God.

449
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,260
 We still deal with the sinful flesh and the temptations of it.

450
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,460
 But now the Holy Spirit within us,

451
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,060
 you know, is giving us desire for the things of God

452
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,060
 and helping us to pursue the things of God in our lives

453
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,660
 and gives us a grace and a strength and a power

454
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,460
 as we learn to rely on the Holy Spirit

455
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,760
 for God's work to unfold in our lives.

456
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,960
 And so you do see, though, that there is tension,

457
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,160
 that we are being pulled in two different directions.

458
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,860
 And that's what verse 17 talks about,

459
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:26,060
 that what the flesh desires is opposite to what the Spirit desires.

460
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:31,860
 Now, one thing that is important, though, to say,

461
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,560
 sometimes you could get an impression

462
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,360
 that these are equal forces at work,

463
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,260
 you know, that the Holy Spirit and the flesh,

464
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,360
 you know, it's like a 50/50 sort of pull.

465
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,060
 But that's not true.

466
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,560
 You know, the Holy Spirit is more powerful than our sinful desires.

467
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,560
 And as we learn to rely on the Holy Spirit,

468
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,860
 you know, He allows us to overcome,

469
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,560
 you know, the temptations that we face

470
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,360
 and to gain victory in our lives over sin.

471
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
 And that is a process.

472
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,160
 And He gives us the grace to do that.

473
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,060
 And He will see us through in that.

474
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,160
 He will give us victory.

475
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,860
 And so, like, one thing that I felt very strongly

476
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,760
 as I'm sharing about this is

477
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,160
 that I think we start believing in the lie,

478
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,060
 you know, that we are just helpless,

479
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,660
 we cannot do anything else,

480
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,960
 we're just stuck in whatever it is going on,

481
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,960
 you know, that we're stuck in with our sinful actions,

482
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,660
 with our acts of the flesh.

483
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,960
 But that Jesus wants to say to us,

484
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,860
 you know, like, "With me, we can overcome this.

485
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,360
 I'm going to give you the strength and a grace

486
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,160
 to transform your life.

487
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,860
 I'm going to give you grace and the strength

488
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,460
 by the power of the Holy Spirit

489
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,460
 to bring true transformation in your hearts,

490
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,860
 in your minds, in your actions."

491
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,860
 And so I just want to just put that very clearly out there,

492
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,960
 that if you are a Christian,

493
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,660
 you know, you, the Holy Spirit will give you victory.

494
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,360
 Now, of course, we have a responsibility

495
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,760
 and we're going to look at that in a second,

496
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,360
 but that's just very important and very clear.

497
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,960
 Now, not too long ago, Pastor Andrew,

498
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,260
 he preached a message and he said something

499
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,760
 that I think is relevant for us here.

500
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,760
 He said, "If the enemy can keep you from being a Christian,

501
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,260
 the next best thing for him to do

502
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,660
 is to keep you from being a mature and effective one."

503
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,060
 And so what the enemy wants to do is he wants the,

504
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,460
 even though we have the Holy Spirit,

505
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,660
 but he wants us keeping being stuck

506
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,660
 in these patterns of sin and these sinful desires

507
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,360
 that were caught up in them

508
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,160
 and that we are then ineffective,

509
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,860
 you know, that we carry a lot of shame,

510
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,860
 that we feel, you know, all of that

511
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,060
 and just are not as available to him.

512
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,860
 That's where the enemy wants us.

513
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,360
 But Jesus has come to set us free,

514
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,660
 has come to break the power of sin in our lives.

515
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,060
 And we are a new creation

516
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,860
 and he wants you to learn to walk and to live

517
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,360
 in the newness that he has created in you.

518
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,460
 And a lot of the transformation,

519
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,760
 God can work instantly.

520
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,560
 Like I met a drug addict

521
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,460
 who told me his testimony in the US

522
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,760
 and when he became a Christian,

523
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,860
 you know, the Holy Spirit broke the power of his addiction.

524
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,060
 I mean, he was addicted to heavy drugs

525
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,660
 that he suddenly couldn't,

526
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,060
 he developed a bad taste for them.

527
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,860
 He couldn't handle them anymore.

528
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,060
 So he pretty much immediately stopped using.

529
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,260
 Now that was a power of the Holy Spirit

530
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,960
 changing that man's life.

531
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
 Now, of course, the Holy Spirit also works

532
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,560
 and I think in many instances works,

533
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,860
 in most instances, gradually.

534
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,660
 You know, as we continue to yield to him,

535
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,360
 as we continue to surrender to him,

536
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,460
 as we continue to come to him and pray and say,

537
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,760
 "Help me with this.

538
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,660
 I struggle with this.

539
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,760
 I feel the pull, you know, from my sinful nature.

540
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,560
 I'm even, or I'm stuck in it."

541
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,560
 But as we continue to come to him

542
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,460
 and offer ourselves to him

543
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,160
 and ask him for his grace and ask him for his strength,

544
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,260
 he will give us his grace,

545
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,260
 he will give us his strength

546
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,760
 and he will help us overcome and see us through it.

547
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,160
 And so, but that's why Paul is encouraging

548
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,560
 the Galatians to be led by the Spirit,

549
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,860
 to live by the Spirit,

550
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,160
 and to keep in step with the Spirit.

551
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,260
 And that's our responsibility.

552
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,660
 But what in the world does that mean?

553
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,860
 How do you do that?

554
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,660
 So that's what I want to look at with you now.

555
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,760
 And that also goes to our opening question.

556
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,860
 How can we be led by the Spirit

557
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
 and live lives that honor God?

558
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,360
 How can we say yes to what the Holy Spirit wants to do

559
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,260
 and see this fruit of the Holy Spirit unfold in our lives

560
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,760
 and see the character of Christ form us more and more

561
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,260
 so we look more and more like Jesus,

562
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,360
 so we become people who contribute to the flourishing

563
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,060
 and the thriving to those around us,

564
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,460
 so we become, so we, our lives reflect the goodness of God

565
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,060
 in the lives of others.

566
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
 So let's look at that.

567
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,160
 So we find some clues in Galatians 5, 24 and 25.

568
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,960
 So I want to read that to you.

569
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,660
 It says that, "Those who belong to Christ Jesus

570
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,460
 have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

571
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,860
 Since we live by the Spirit,

572
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,460
 let us keep in step with the Spirit."

573
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,760
 So how do we live by the Spirit?

574
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,560
 Well, first, we need to put to death daily

575
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,560
 the flesh with its passions and desires.

576
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,660
 You know, Paul talked about, "I am crucified with Christ.

577
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,660
 It is no longer I who live, but it's Christ who lives in me.

578
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:53,060
 The life I now live, I live in the flesh in faith in Him

579
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,160
 who loves me and gave Himself for me."

580
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,260
 That was almost correct, but not 100%.

581
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,660
 You know, so that is, when you're a Christian,

582
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,860
 that's our story.

583
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,660
 That's our narrative.

584
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,060
 We are crucified with Christ.

585
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,360
 So yes, won this victory, but then on a daily basis,

586
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,660
 as these things come up, we need to battle them.

587
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,260
 We need to engage in actually what's happening.

588
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,060
 We need to bring those things to Jesus.

589
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,860
 We can do that on our own, where we come and pray to Jesus,

590
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,760
 "Jesus, help me.

591
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,960
 Give me grace.

592
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,060
 Give me strength to overcome this thing that's going on."

593
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,960
 I think a lot of times there's power in actually talking,

594
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,160
 perhaps a close friend,

595
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,460
 maybe it's your community group leader,

596
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,660
 maybe it's a pastor,

597
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,660
 maybe somebody from the prayer team,

598
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,260
 somebody you know here,

599
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,860
 just ask them to pray with you,

600
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:46,460
 to overcome and put to death the things of the flesh in your life.

601
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,160
 And to ask Jesus for victory,

602
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,860
 to ask the Holy Spirit to lead you

603
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,660
 and to give you the strength and this grace to overcome

604
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,560
 whatever that you are facing that is going on.

605
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,760
 Now, the second thing is, we find a clue in verse 25.

606
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,660
 It says, "Since we live by the Spirit,

607
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,260
 let us keep on step with the Spirit."

608
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,760
 Our life as a Christian begins through the Spirit.

609
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,260
 Gospel of John talks about we are born again.

610
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,960
 We're born of the Spirit.

611
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,660
 That's how our Christian life begins.

612
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,860
 That's how we are a new creation.

613
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,660
 You know, the new has come, the old has gone.

614
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,060
 But it's not only that we begin our life through the Spirit.

615
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,060
 We actually also live our life by the power of the Holy Spirit.

616
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,260
 That was something that Paul talked about

617
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,260
 in Galatians 3, 3 that, you know, now that you began the Spirit,

618
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,460
 why are you trying to continue in the flesh

619
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,560
 to gain righteousness and holiness?

620
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,060
 It's like you need to continue with the Spirit.

621
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,660
 Well, it also uses here in this verse, in verse 25,

622
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,160
 the metaphor of keeping in step with the Spirit.

623
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,660
 So keeping in step with the Spirit,

624
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:00,460
 that is an imagery or a metaphor of military marching.

625
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,460
 And so for us to keep in step with the Spirit,

626
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,460
 we're walking step for step with the Spirit in the same, in unison.

627
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,460
 Well, how do we do that?

628
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:14,060
 Well, one thing is we actually need to draw close to God.

629
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,160
 And we draw close to God because if you want to keep in step with the Spirit,

630
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,560
 you need to be close with the Spirit, to walk with the Spirit,

631
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,060
 to be aligned with the Spirit,

632
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,960
 so that your life and your actions are aligned with Him.

633
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,160
 And so we draw close to God, A, through repentance.

634
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,760
 When we come to God and say,

635
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,760
 "Lord, I know the way I'm living is wrong.

636
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,460
 Please forgive me."

637
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,260
 God loves to forgive us.

638
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,460
 He loves showing us His grace.

639
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,160
 If we confess our sins,

640
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,860
 He's faithful and just to forgive us our sins

641
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,460
 and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

642
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,360
 Talks about in 1 John 1, verse 9.

643
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,760
 And so we come in repentance.

644
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,260
 So that's one way of drawing close.

645
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,760
 But we also draw close, you know, by spending time in God's Word

646
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,960
 and saying, "Holy Spirit, you know,

647
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,560
 reveal to me what you're saying, you know, through this Word.

648
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,560
 Help me to understand this."

649
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,060
 We also draw close to God by prayerful relationship with Jesus

650
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,160
 as we live in this relationship.

651
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,860
 And we're just prayerfully talking throughout the day.

652
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,160
 You know, you don't have to always have a quiet place

653
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,060
 and be able to close your eyes to pray.

654
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,460
 You can pray even while somebody else is talking,

655
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,360
 you know, with your eyes open.

656
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,960
 And we're just living this relationship, you know, with the Holy Spirit.

657
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,260
 And we're open, we're available for the Holy Spirit to speak to us.

658
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,360
 And we can gain a better sense for what He's saying.

659
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,660
 And then also we can desire, we can pray,

660
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,560
 "Holy Spirit, fill me, fill me with your presence.

661
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,160
 Fill me.

662
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,860
 Show me what it is that you desire of me.

663
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,660
 Show me what it means to walk with you.

664
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,860
 And as we make that our desire, our heart's longing,

665
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,060
 you know, as we pour that out to God,

666
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,360
 He will meet us and He will empower us

667
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,860
 and He will give us strength to walk and keep and step with Him.

668
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,860
 And then another part is obedience.

669
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,260
 You know, when God tells us something, we actually need to do it.

670
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,860
 And that's like one part that we also struggle.

671
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,860
 But if God shows you something, reveals something,

672
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,260
 you actually need to do it.

673
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,560
 We actually need to put in practice.

674
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:28,560
 And so obedience is also a way of drawing close to God.

675
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,660
 And so then finally, and so I thought that aligned amazingly with the worship,

676
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,160
 is that we need to trust God's promises.

677
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,260
 If we want to walk with the Spirit,

678
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,660
 if we want to see the fruit of the Spirit unfold in our lives.

679
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,060
 Because here's the thing, you know,

680
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,560
 the fruit of the Spirit is not something that you or I can bring about in our lives.

681
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:56,160
 It is always 100% the work of God.

682
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,160
 And He wants to unfold that in your lives.

683
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,160
 And He also will unfold that in your lives.

684
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,060
 And so we can trust in His promises.

685
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,660
 Now a lot of times we're overwhelmed because we're fumbling and stumbling,

686
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,960
 you know, through life.

687
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,860
 Actually, I have to think of my baby girl, Ellie.

688
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,060
 She learned walking a month ago.

689
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,460
 So she walks, but she's not walking that stable yet.

690
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,760
 So she fumbles and fumbles,

691
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,760
 but she eventually gets to where she's trying to go.

692
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,360
 And I think this is a picture for us

693
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,560
 that maybe we feel like we're fumbling, stumbling,

694
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,460
 where we keep not being who we want to be.

695
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:43,060
 But God promises that He will get you to where,

696
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,560
 you know, to where He has a plan for us.

697
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,560
 He will accomplish His saving, His healing,

698
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,760
 His renewing work in your life.

699
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,260
 He will make you holy.

700
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,960
 He will bring about the life of Christ

701
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,460
 that is reflective in your life.

702
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,060
 He will unfold the fruit of the Spirit in your life.

703
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,860
 And so Philippians 1, 6, it says this.

704
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,360
 It says, "Being confident of this,

705
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,260
 that we who began a good work in you

706
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,260
 will carry it to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."

707
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,660
 So that's Philippians 1, verse 6.

708
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,160
 Let me read this again.

709
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,760
 "Being confident of this,

710
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,160
 that he who began a good work in you

711
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,860
 will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."

712
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,860
 That's God's promise to us,

713
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,060
 that He will bring us to completion.

714
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,460
 And we can have faith that God is faithful.

715
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,160
 We sang about it earlier,

716
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,760
 and that He will see us through.

717
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,860
 You know, He will bring about this transformation

718
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,060
 in our hearts and in our lives.

719
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,160
 And so we can rest in that.

720
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,960
 And the way we do that is just by beholding by who God is,

721
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,660
 by meditating on His Word,

722
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,160
 and just saying, "It's not by my strength,

723
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,860
 but it's by your power,

724
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,260
 you know, that we will overcome whatever issue you're facing,

725
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,660
 and He will see me through.

726
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,360
 He will bring victory.

727
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,060
 He will complete His work that He has begun in you."

728
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,860
 And so we have reason to be hopeful.

729
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,460
 And confident in God.

730
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,960
 I want to invite the worship team to come up.

731
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:25,960
 Now, some of us, you know, we've been feeling

732
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,160
 just this battle raging.

733
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,760
 And maybe even today, as maybe even last night or this week,

734
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,660
 you know, we gave in to the desires of the flesh.

735
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,660
 And you hear this morning,

736
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,860
 and maybe this was not the most comfortable message to come to,

737
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:49,560
 but I believe that God wants to just pour His grace and forgiveness.

738
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
 You know, it is available.

739
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,260
 He doesn't shame you.

740
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,160
 He doesn't shame us when we come to Him with our struggles.

741
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,760
 That's why He died for us.

742
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
 And He did it willingly.

743
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,460
 And He did it, you know, because He loves us.

744
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,860
 And He meets us with that same love.

745
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:09,260
 And He just wants to pour His grace, His forgiveness,

746
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,760
 you know, over you if that's you right now.

747
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,260
 He just wants to reveal His love to you, remove the shame.

748
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,960
 He's saying, "I love you."

749
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,260
 Now, others of us, we've lost trust in God.

750
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,260
 Like we're just find ourselves in these, you know,

751
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,260
 struggling with these temptations and with the sin.

752
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,060
 And we're like, "Is God ever going to come through?

753
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,260
 Is He ever -- am I ever going to overcome this?

754
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,460
 Am I going to be eternally stuck in these habitual patterns of sin?

755
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:50,260
 And for whatever reason, am I able to -- is He broken in my life?"

756
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:57,560
 And as we heard today, the truth is that, you know, Jesus is more powerful.

757
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,060
 He will see you through.

758
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,760
 He will give you victory.

759
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,560
 Come to Him.

760
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,060
 He wants to restore trust in our lives.

761
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,560
 He wants to renew our faith in Him.

762
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,560
 And He wants to shut down the lie of the enemy who tells us there is no hope.

763
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,760
 You know, you're just stuck there.

764
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
 That's just where you are.

765
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,760
 But that's a lie.

766
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:29,260
 Jesus wants to break the power of sin in your life and give you freedom

767
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,260
 and let you walk in His freedom.

768
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,260
 I want to invite you just -- everyone to stand.

769
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,260
 Just -- if you want to just make yourself available to, you know, the Holy Spirit,

770
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,760
 I just want to encourage you to stretch out your hands before you.

771
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,260
 And we'd just love to pray over you.

772
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:01,260
 Jesus, I thank you that you are not finished with us yet.

773
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,760
 We pray, Holy Spirit, come.

774
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,760
 We fill your people with your presence.

775
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,760
 We fill your people with the fruit of the Spirit.

776
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
 We unfold this work in our lives.

777
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,260
 There's so many areas where we're not yet who we want to be,

778
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,760
 not yet who you have created us to be, who you're calling us to be.

779
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,760
 But, Lord, we're trusting you that you will give us victory,

780
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,260
 that your work will unfold in our lives,

781
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:30,760
 and that we will be more beautiful, more holy, more like you,

782
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,260
 as we just keep coming to you.

783
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,760
 And, see, Lord, we desire that.

784
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
 We want that.

785
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,260
 Lord, I pray for anyone who's, you know, just experiencing shame

786
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,760
 and just been overwhelmed by that.

787
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,260
 Holy Spirit, I pray that you reveal your love, your grace,

788
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,760
 the love of Jesus, the grace of Jesus right now.

789
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,760
 That you wash away our sins, that you wash away our brokenness,

790
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,760
 that you bring healing, that you bring renewal,

791
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,760
 that you do something new.

792
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:07,760
 Lord, I thank you that we are a work in progress that you will complete,

793
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,260
 that we will be more like you, more loving,

794
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,760
 that we will--the fruit of the Spirit will unfold in us.

795
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,760
 And I pray for us as a community that we be a community.

796
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,760
 And I pray for when people come here that they can see the fruit of your Spirit.

797
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,760
 You know, how there is love, how there is generosity, how there is kindness,

798
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,760
 how there is patience, how there is peace, how there is gentleness,

799
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,760
 how there is self-control, and that people will know it's because,

800
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,760
 Holy Spirit, you are at work among us.

801
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
 And so I pray for your blessing.

802
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
 I pray for your strength.

803
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,760
 I pray for your provision over every one of us.

804
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,200
 Thank you Jesus that you are not finished with us and we say Amen.
