[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   Grateful for this moment to gather both here in the room and online, Lord.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.360]   Grateful that your presence is at work and moving amongst us.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.480]   Lord, we pray for every home right now that is watching this live feed.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.160]   Lord, we thank you so much for the people that are gathered in communities around the
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.960]   world and here in Hong Kong.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.360]   Lord, we thank you that our church is not just contained to these four walls.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:30.240]   And so we just lift up prayer for each home, for each story, for each person.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.280]   Father we pray that you would reach them right now.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.840]   Lord, that we are so grateful that we get to be a community in person, online, together,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.280]   one unified body of Christ.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.920]   And Father, I thank you for each person in this room, for their story, for their journey,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.240]   for what's happening in their lives right now.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.760]   Lord, we've loved your presence with us.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.320]   But as we open your word, we know that we are therefore opening your presence at a deeper
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.800]   level.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.240]   Because you say that you are the logos, you are the word.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.480]   So as we open your scriptures, as we open story, as we open up principles of theology,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.040]   Lord, would you be even more present with us.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.960]   And Lord, we celebrate that, we're excited about that, and we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.360]   Everyone says?
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360]   Amen.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.360]   Amen.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.800]   Let's give it up for the worship team for, oh man.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.360]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.560]   Well what an amazing time.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.280]   I'm so excited.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.080]   Real human people in the room.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.080]   Hi.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.360]   How are you all?
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.680]   Are you guys good?
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.680]   It's so good to see you.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.680]   Welcome to the Upper House.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   How are you guys?
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.960]   Everybody doing all right up there?
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.960]   Beautiful.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.960]   You guys look amazing.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.600]   Socially spread out and amazing.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   I love that.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.360]   That's beautiful.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.280]   I'm carrying in my spirit something that I'm really excited to preach to you guys today
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280]   about.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.440]   I've been saying this so many times, I'm going to keep saying it.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.640]   There is never, I think in the whole of the history of Hong Kong, never a more important
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.280]   time to be Christian in our city than right now.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.400]   I'm so excited about where we are as the church and what is ahead of us in the years ahead
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.800]   for the gospel in our city.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.560]   No more important time for us to lean into the reality of what it is that we've been
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.320]   saved for.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.720]   What it is that we get to gather in this room and sing praises for.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.480]   We have to ask ourselves, is it just for us?
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.300]   Is what we're doing here just for this moment of 90 minutes?
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.240]   Or does it have something to say to everything that's taking place in not just our city in
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.200]   Hong Kong, but around the world right now?
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:51.240]   I believe that the Christian faith is the most profoundly important thing for this world
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   in this hour.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.440]   And I want to open up for us today as we start this new series and over the next seven weeks,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.880]   what I think it is to live the Christian faith in this moment.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.520]   I want to tell you a little bit about your story.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.280]   I want to talk to you about the gospel and about what it is that you've been saved for.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.880]   I want to challenge you also over the next seven weeks to rise up, to begin to be a voice
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.840]   of God's gospel in everything that is happening around us.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.200]   I want to call you to be different.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.120]   Are you ready?
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.800]   Let me start with a story.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.160]   Twenty years ago, twenty years ago.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160]   I'm old.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.360]   It's always dangerous when you start a story with twenty years ago.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.400]   Twenty years ago, I led a small group of teenagers of youth from the Vine on a missions trip
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.260]   to the slums of Manila.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.600]   We were partnering with YWAM, visiting this particular part of metro Manila.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.560]   It's not there anymore, but in those days, twenty years ago, there was this place called
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   Smoky Mountain.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.640]   I don't know if you've ever heard of Smoky Mountain.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.400]   It was famous around the world as being the world's largest rubbish dump.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.280]   It was right there in the middle of metro Manila.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.520]   It looked exactly like this.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:17.040]   This huge rubbish tip had four thousand people that lived on it and made their lives from
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.120]   it, scavenging on the rubbish tip day in, day out, gathering things up so they could
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.800]   take it and sell it and make a livelihood.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.360]   Our mission for a week, partnering with YWAM, was to go and do outreach to the four thousand
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.280]   people that were on this rubbish tip.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.040]   There was this basketball court, a couple of basketball courts right by the side of
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.040]   Smoky Mountain.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.960]   Now, you know in the Philippines, everything starts around basketball, right?
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.640]   There was these basketball courts, and we would go and we would hold outreach on these
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.760]   basketball courts for the people that were working and living, the children, the families
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760]   on Smoky Mountain.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.240]   Well, on this one particular day, we thought that traffic in Manila was going to be really
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.240]   bad.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.920]   Who's faced traffic in Manila?
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.200]   You know it's bad, the worst in the world.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.580]   We thought it was going to be really bad, and so we went super early, but I guess God
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.680]   liked the Red Sea, parted the traffic for us.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.120]   And we got there 45 minutes early.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.800]   And we all got out of the van, there's me and like 10 kids, and I'm like the youth pastor
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.000]   going, "What are we going to do for 45 minutes with all these youth that are kind of just
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.160]   like, you know, wondering what's next?"
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.280]   And I look up and I notice that around Smoky Mountain, right where we were by the basketball
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.160]   courts was this temporary housing unit.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.360]   And in this temporary housing unit, there were five or six homes that were on these
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.160]   rickety kind of bamboo structures.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.960]   And so I got this idea, "Okay, why don't we go up and we'll knock on the doors of these
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.520]   families and we'll go in there and we'll introduce ourselves and we'll share a little bit and
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.920]   we'll pray for them as families."
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.320]   We thought this was a great idea, so I got all the youth and they were super excited.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.040]   We walked up these rickety staircases and we knocked on the first door and we went in
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.320]   and we're like, "Hi, we're from Hong Kong."
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.040]   You know, and this family was like, "What is going on?"
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.640]   You know, and then we would tell them a little bit about Jesus and we would pray for them
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   as a family.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.480]   We'd go out and we'd knock on the next door and we kept on doing this.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.840]   And by the time we got to the last door, we had about seven minutes left before we were
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.920]   supposed to be on the basketball court to do our outreach.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.260]   And I said to the team, "Okay, guys, we don't have a lot of time with this family.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.260]   We're just going to knock on the door.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.260]   We're going to go in.
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.260]   We're going to say hi.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.840]   We're going to pray real quick and then we're going to funnel out and get on with the outreach
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   downstairs."
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   And everybody was ready for it.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.840]   We opened the door, we went in.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.260]   As soon as we stepped into this last room, we recognized that this was different from
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.260]   all the other ones.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.760]   It was immediately just darker and dingier.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.320]   There was like this curtain that was pulled across the window, the only window in the
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.320]   hut.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:46.040]   And as we walked up, we found and discovered this old couple, probably in their mid-80s,
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.900]   sitting there on a bed.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.160]   And we noticed the man straight away because he had these two milky white type cataracts
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.240]   over his eyes.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.880]   And we could tell that he was blind.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.260]   And so we said through an interpreter, "Can you tell us your story?"
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.220]   And he said, "Well, I've lived here on Smoky Mountain for 15 years.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.120]   And during that time, because of the way that the sun comes and combusts all the things
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.380]   on Smoky Mountain, all of the smoke has ruined my eyesight and I can no longer see.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.080]   I've got two full cataracts on my eyes from all of that smoke for all of those years and
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.080]   I can't see anymore."
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.020]   And we had this real compassion for him.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.780]   And I said, "Okay, guys, well, let's just pray for this family.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.420]   Let's pray for God's blessing."
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.120]   And so we kind of stretched our hands out.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.820]   I was doing the kind of pray, check my watch prayer because I needed to get down for this
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.140]   outreach.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.300]   And we finished the prayer and I started to funnel the kids out real quick.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:42.980]   And as all the kids go out, the last girl in our youth ministry, she was 14 years old.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.960]   And she stands in the door as I'm trying to usher her out of the house.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.820]   And she says to me, "I believe God wants to heal this man."
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.680]   Uh-oh.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.760]   This is like every youth pastor's worst nightmare.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.980]   This is like a lose-lose situation, right?
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.980]   Because if I don't pretend to have as much faith as she's got, I look like the loser,
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.980]   right?
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.780]   Equally, if we go in there, I know that on the whole, I've experienced, I know that God's
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.140]   probably not going to heal this person.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.340]   I know that's probably not going to happen.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.740]   And so therefore, I'm going to have to spend the rest of the afternoon trying to describe
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.420]   theologically to these kids why God doesn't always heal when we have faith.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.140]   And I'm going through all of this and she's standing there with these big doe eyes going,
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.260]   "I believe God can heal this man."
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.380]   I'm looking at my watch and I'm going, "All right, everybody back in the room, back in
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.380]   the room.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.380]   Come on, come on quickly.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.380]   Okay, okay, just say a prayer for him.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.380]   Come on, let's go."
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.380]   You know?
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.900]   So she gathers around and we all gather around and she puts her little hand on this guy's
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.060]   shoulder and she offers the simplest prayer.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.300]   I don't remember exactly what it was.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.100]   It was something like, "God, would you just heal this man?"
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:53.460]   And what happened next is kind of hard to describe.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.580]   The best way I could describe it is, it's a little bit like if you've got a car and
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.020]   your windshield of your car is completely dirty and you turn on the windscreen wipers
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.420]   and it goes like this and cleans all that dirt away.
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:11.100]   Like literally as I'm staring at this man, the cataracts in his eyes, the milky whiteness
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.620]   just is wiped away.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:22.400]   And I'm like, "Oh, I don't believe what has just happened."
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.140]   And this is a real gritty, real life miracle.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.860]   Not like ones that we read in the Bible.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.460]   This is really happening in this moment.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.420]   And because it's a real miracle, this man has not had light enter his eyes for about
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.420]   15 years.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.820]   So suddenly all this light is flooding into his system.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.500]   It freaks him out.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.500]   He goes, "Ahhhh!"
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.460]   And he grabs his eyes and he starts screaming as loud as he can.
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.020]   And his wife starts screaming right next to him.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.820]   The kids start screaming.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.100]   I'm screaming as well.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.780]   It's a scream fest.
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.780]   And this man's like, "Ahhhh!"
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.780]   Like this.
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:05.580]   And then slowly, he's got his hands over his eyes and then he lets them down slowly and
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.660]   he's squinting and he's in like a little bit of pain and he's singing.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.840]   And he starts to count us in the room.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.960]   And his wife starts to weep and weep and we're all weeping and weeping.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.480]   And I'm like, "Forget the outreach."
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.340]   Like God's kingdom has come on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.340]   It's literally invaded this moment and in this life.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.760]   And then God has turned and changed and transformed this man.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:43.300]   And I'm there and I realize it's all because some 14-year-old girl had something different
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.600]   in her.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.460]   Something different from her youth pastor.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:56.600]   That she was carrying something in her that set her apart.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:03.340]   That she could stare deformity in its face and go, "I think I know a God who can do something
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.020]   about that."
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:11.140]   That she might carry something in her that was so different from the rest of us that
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:18.460]   God honors the reality that she was courageous enough to declare the promises of God when
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:24.460]   all I wanted to do was get to a basketball court.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.900]   This series that we're starting today, I believe is the central word for what God has for the
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.180]   Vine in this hour that we're in.
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.440]   There is no more important time for us to begin to realize, to remember, to celebrate
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.680]   that we have something in us.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.140]   That means that we are different to the things that are around us in this world.
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.220]   If you think about all the things that are happening right now in our city, I believe
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.900]   that we are in an inflection point for the gospel right now in Hong Kong.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.780]   That I think we're literally on a precipice where we're either going to move forward as
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:06.620]   the church in this city, holding the gospel loud and proud, or we're going to move back
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.140]   and we're going to lose a generation to Jesus.
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.820]   I think we're at an inflection point because of everything that's taking place pandemic
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.660]   and politically right now.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.260]   This city is still hurting.
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.200]   This city is still trying to work out what its identity is moving forward.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.700]   There are people in this city that are scared and fearful.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.860]   There are people in this city who are wondering, "Is it time to pack up the bags and go?"
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.580]   Perhaps some of us are wrestling with that in this room right now.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.140]   There are people in this city that are hurting and still confused and wondering what's next.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.980]   I think the church has to ask itself a really important question.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:51.580]   Will we, the church in Hong Kong, become a bold and central voice of hope and faith and
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.020]   life and love in this time for the years ahead?
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:05.500]   Or will we feebly shrink back into the shadows of our own self-concern and self-preservation?
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.580]   Will the church in Hong Kong stand up and stand out?
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:15.180]   Will it shrink back and fade out?
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:22.500]   Will the church begin to actually live out the gospel the way that it was always designed
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   to be?
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:29.420]   Or will we settle for a gospel that keeps the lights on in here but shuts down our light
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.000]   out there?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.020]   Come on, church.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:38.180]   There's an inflection point right now in our city.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.180]   Let me tell you this.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:46.340]   Jesus didn't die on the cross so that we could enjoy a nice Christian holy huddle.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:53.420]   Jesus didn't die on the cross so that Christians would just know comfort and safety and security.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.380]   I want to misquote C.S. Lewis here.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.940]   I don't know if that's a thing, but I'm going to do it.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.460]   I'm going to misquote him by saying this.
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:05.220]   The Christian faith is good, but it's not safe.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.980]   Jesus died on the cross not for our comfort.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:15.700]   Jesus died on the cross to create a new humanity, to begin the starting point of a new story,
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:21.740]   to create something within the mess and the brokenness that is different from it, that
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:27.500]   brings a hope, that brings a story and a narrative that begins to say something to that brokenness
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.500]   around.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.660]   Jesus' death and resurrection was a declaration that God's not getting rid of all of the
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.900]   mess, but he's starting afresh within it.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:40.980]   Paul would speak of Jesus as the new Adam, the starting point of a new story, of a new
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.940]   invitation, and that Jesus himself would say in all of his teachings before he got to the
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:52.060]   cross, "I am here to start, to bring, to declare the kingdom of God."
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.060]   In other words, my death on the cross is going to create what I like to call an alternative
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:05.260]   society, something about a new group of people that live within the rest of society, don't
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:11.260]   separate from it, don't go to be a monastery on a hill or birth within it, but are different
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.260]   to it.
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:19.700]   I believe God is going to heal this man.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.740]   Jesus spoke about this alternative society a lot, the kingdom of God, the reign of God
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.740]   on earth.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.140]   In Matthew chapter 13, he tells us a bunch of stories about it.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:34.700]   My favorite is this, the kingdom of God, this thing that Jesus died and rose again for,
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.220]   the thing that we get to call ourselves Christian around, it's like this.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.620]   It's like a little piece of yeast being placed in a large amount of dough.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:49.460]   It's very small, but because it's in this large amount of dough and because it's different
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:55.820]   from that dough, when it gets kneaded over time, over a long period of time, guess what?
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:00.460]   Something so small can actually influence the whole dough and literally transform it
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.460]   into bread.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.020]   Jesus is saying, "Do you want to know what this kingdom is like?
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.180]   Why I'm dying and rising again?
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.660]   Just so that there would be something different in you.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:15.980]   So you might be like a piece of yeast, placed in your school or in your family or in your
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.300]   workplace or in your city.
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:25.780]   And over a period of time, God can take our differentness and begin to work and influence
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.780]   in society.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.540]   The problem is, I think the church for so long, and particularly the modern church,
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.820]   has misinterpreted that parable and they said, "Oh, the church is like dough in dough."
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.420]   I mean, if we want to be relevant in this world, well, we just need to look a little
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.420]   bit more like the world.
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.020]   We need to do things a little bit like them, but even better than them.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.180]   It means we need to imitate and copy what's happening in the world, but slap a Christian
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.340]   label on it.
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.220]   We've come to think that our faith is dough in dough.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.260]   But Jesus is like, "Be different.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:02.620]   That I'm starting in you a different story.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.620]   Not be weird."
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.940]   Us Christians have struggled with this one as well.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.260]   He didn't say, "Be weird."
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.700]   We've all got the uncle, haven't we, in our family, right?
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.100]   You know, the weird uncle, right?
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.860]   That like no one knows what to do with and comes to the annual family barbecue and stands
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.380]   in the corner and smells a little bit, right?
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.660]   That's not us, okay?
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.020]   We're not supposed to be weird, but we are supposed to carry something different.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.220]   What is the different thing that we carry?
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.580]   Jesus' hope, Jesus' forgiveness, Jesus' love.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.620]   As we begin to love one another, we begin to show the world what that love looks like.
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.820]   As we carry the hope that we've been redeemed, we realize it's not just for us, but it's
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:40.820]   for everyone else.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.740]   And we begin to speak of that hope boldly and courageously so that others might know
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.100]   the character and the person of God.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.180]   The difference is not us.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.940]   The difference is Jesus.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.900]   And we get to make Jesus known.
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:04.460]   I don't want to do anything else with my life but that.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:10.580]   The great powerful audacity of the Christian faith is that through a relationship with
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:16.220]   Christ Jesus, we get to declare to the world that we are yeast in dough, a light in the
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.820]   darkness, a city on a hill.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.980]   And we get to live out the realities of what that looks like.
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.980]   What does it mean for us to be different in Hong Kong in this time where there is fear,
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.220]   we might move in courage.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.500]   Where there is uncertainty and concern, we might declare faith.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:40.100]   Where there is slavery, we might break chains.
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:46.820]   That we might become the church that God died for.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.460]   I think we're at an inflection point where as a church we get to decide if that's what
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.460]   we want or not.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:58.900]   And whether we're going to have our voice be heard.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.140]   There's a lot of stories in Scripture around holding this different type of approach.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.580]   I call it a different spirit.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.780]   What I want to challenge us in over the next seven weeks is what it is to hold a different
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:11.780]   spirit.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:17.220]   Again, not to be weird or strange or different for different sake, but to realize that in
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.060]   the story of the gospel and in the power of the spirit alive in us, there is something
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.100]   different that we carry that has something to say of hope in the world around us.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.860]   This different spirit is throughout Scripture, Old and New Testament.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.340]   What we're going to do over these seven weeks is we're going to park ourselves in one story
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.020]   in the Old Testament.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.980]   It's one of the most famous stories of the Old Testament.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.820]   It's found in Numbers chapter 13 and 14.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.460]   It's the story of the 12 spies being sent out to spy Canaan, the promised land that
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.460]   had been promised to them.
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.700]   And what we're going to do is we're going to go week by week through this story together,
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:56.420]   and I'm going to show you what a different spirit looks like because I want to empower
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:02.620]   us and release us to live that different spirit in our city today.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:08.920]   Let me give you some context to this story as an introduction this morning.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:13.580]   We know that God has released Israel from their slavery in Egypt, and He's done it through
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.840]   compassion.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.180]   He's done it miraculously.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.440]   He's parted the waters.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.880]   He's brought them out, and they're now in their freedom.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.620]   But freedom is not an easy thing.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.700]   Freedom has responsibilities.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:31.220]   And in that whole journey of slavery into freedom, God's been giving them one story
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.820]   the whole time.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.100]   There's an inheritance for you.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.580]   There's a land that I'm leading you to.
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.460]   There's a place where I'm going to be moving you into, a place that flows with milk and
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.220]   honey, a land that is a gift of God's people, that it's going to be a place for you to grow
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:52.240]   in, to learn in, to flourish, a safe environment where you get to show the world what God looks
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   like.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.880]   There's a land for you.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.660]   And this dream and this vision and this promise of an inheritance of a land keeps Israel going.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.780]   And now in Numbers 13 and 14, they're right at the Jordan River, and they can see the
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.060]   land just right there.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.460]   And Moses does something really smart.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:14.940]   Rather than just suddenly invading the land, he gets 12 of the best men from the different
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.940]   12 tribes of Israel.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.100]   And he says to them, "I want you to go into the land and spy it out and come back and
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.100]   give us a report.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.020]   Is this actually the land that God's promised to us?
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.780]   What is it like?"
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:30.140]   And so these 12 go out, and for 40 days, they spy out the land, they come back, and they
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.380]   give a report to Israel.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.980]   And the report essentially is twofold.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.480]   Number one, it is an amazing land.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.260]   It does flow with milk and honey.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.340]   There's incredible fruit in this land, and that fruit is good.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.940]   Look, we've even brought some of that fruit back to show you this is an amazing place.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.940]   What an inheritance.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:52.380]   And then the second part of their report is, there's a but, right?
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.020]   You know you're in trouble when there's that.
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.900]   And they say, "But there's giants in that land.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.260]   I mean, there's obstacles.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.860]   There's fortified cities.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.940]   There's stuff that's there in that land.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:08.300]   We have to get to outreach in just a few moments of basketball court.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.580]   There's distractions.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:14.340]   There's things there that will stop us from moving in."
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:19.600]   And they begin to give this report that this is the end, that we've come all this way.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.440]   Why has God let us out of slavery in Egypt and brought us here to be killed by the giants
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.460]   in the promised land?
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.840]   And fear begins to spread in the camp.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:39.480]   In this time of our society and culture, in our world right now, fear spreads in the camp
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.240]   because of bad reports.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.800]   I shudder to use the word fake news, but you're with me, right?
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   Opinions.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.080]   Everybody with a keyboard telling us what we should believe and think.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:56.200]   Everybody telling us whether this virus is good or not, the vaccine is good or not.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:02.480]   All these obstacles in communication and information, and we get swamped by it, and we get information
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.280]   fatigue, and it can lead us very easily into a place where we're no longer listening to
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:16.360]   the promises of God, and we're absorbing all of the commentary of the world.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:23.320]   Two spies, though, are willing to say to Moses, "I believe God could heal this man."
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.400]   Two spies stand up and say, "Hm, hang on a sec.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.680]   I mean, if this is a promise of God, if this is His land that He's giving to us, then I
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.240]   think we can take this land.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.760]   Yeah, we see the obstacles, but you know what?
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.800]   Our God is bigger than that."
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:43.440]   There are two that begin to give a different voice to the situation, begin to stand up
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.120]   and say, "No, actually, we cannot forget that God is at work.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.120]   We cannot forget.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.280]   We see the obstacles.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.000]   We see the giants, but there's something bigger than the giants.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.720]   There's the God behind them, and that God is way more powerful, and if we could just
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.200]   believe that God could do this, then everything could..."
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:06.240]   And they begin to say, two voices out of the 12, that God is still with us.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.200]   God sees all this happening, and He's like, "Okay."
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.960]   And He separates the 10 from the 2.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:19.520]   And God says to the 10, "Because you are unfaithful, because you fail to believe, none of your
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.840]   descendants will ever enter the inheritance and the promise that I've given you."
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:29.960]   And He turns to the 2, and He says, "Because of you two, your descendants, your people
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.760]   will inherit the promises of God."
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:39.720]   I believe that Hong Kong as a city is God's promised land.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:46.880]   I believe God has Hong Kong as an inheritance, that the gospel is still ripe for work in
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   this city.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   Are we going to be the 10, or are we going to be the 2?
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.840]   Here's how God puts it in Numbers 14.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.520]   Is everybody okay?
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.520]   You still like me?
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.520]   Good.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:07.480]   Verse 21, it says this, "Surely as I live," this is God speaking, "and as surely as the
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.360]   glory of the Lord fills the whole earth," notice that, the whole earth, right?
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.600]   Including the promised land where the giants are.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.280]   "Not one of the men who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I performed in Egypt, in
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.400]   the desert, but who disobeyed me and tested me 10 times, not one of them will ever see
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.100]   the land I promised on the oath to their forefathers.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.820]   No one has treated me with contempt will ever see it.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:35.120]   But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.040]   bring him into the land that he went to and his descendants will inherit it because this
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.600]   one has a different spirit.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.040]   This one carries something of my character.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.120]   This one believes in my promises above what he sees in the world.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:55.760]   This one and all of his descendants and his family will walk into that inheritance.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   This one."
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.760]   Why?
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.760]   Because he carried a different spirit.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   Caleb allowed his incredible vision of God and his understanding of God's power and his
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:17.280]   promises to filter into his thoughts and actions and his public expression of his faith.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:22.000]   And God saw that and believed it was very, very good.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.720]   Over the next seven weeks, I'm going to teach you about what I think this different spirit
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.640]   is all about.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.760]   But I want to start today by telling you what the different spirit is not.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.200]   Are you ready for this?
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   A different spirit is not manufactured by the flesh.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.440]   A different spirit is not something that we work up in us with some nice music or some
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.000]   rah-rah or some shouting.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.080]   A different spirit is not something created in us.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.680]   It is not our inner skills or our inner strength or our personal abilities.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.720]   It is not the thing that I do that I do really well.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.960]   My different spirit is not the strength that I have, even if that strength has come from
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.600]   my years of walking with Jesus.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.120]   It's got nothing to do with the person or the gifts or the abilities of me.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.960]   If that was the case, then when God showed up to these 12 people, he would have said
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.320]   they all had a different spirit.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.600]   Because the 10 spies were the strongest, most courageous, bravest, best leaders of their
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   tribes.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.560]   That was why they were chosen to go into the promised land.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.880]   But God doesn't say that.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.720]   He says over here, these two have something different to the rest.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.200]   So a different spirit has nothing to do with our abilities.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.920]   Can I have an amen?
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:44.320]   A different spirit also is not a type A personality.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.480]   A different spirit is not being extroverted.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.320]   Can I have an amen, introverts?
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.600]   Now I might be an extrovert myself, but the reality is a different spirit is not about
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.000]   your ability to communicate, your ability to be passionate, how loud you raise your
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.040]   voice, how comfortable you are in social settings, whether you're a good leader or not.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.160]   It's not about a personality profile.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:10.680]   The Bible is filled with introverts that change the world.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.800]   As hard as that is for me to say, it is true.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.080]   Introverts everywhere in Scripture do amazing things.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:22.800]   Moses, I can't go before Pharaoh because I stutter.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.400]   I have no voice.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   Daniel, introvert.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:35.360]   Amos, Barnabas, Timothy, Jude, John, ones that would prefer the quieter life are used
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.160]   so profoundly and powerfully in God's story.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.560]   In fact, I would argue there are more introverts at work in Scripture than extroverts.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:48.040]   So a different spirit has absolutely nothing to do with your personality profile.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.840]   Are you with me?
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.320]   Here's the third thing.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:59.320]   A different spirit is not about moral perfection or your amazing holiness.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.640]   Now this is really important because I think as a church we can get foiled into this trap
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   quite a lot.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.600]   You're hearing me today and you're hearing what I'm saying and you're thinking, "Okay,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   I get it.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.240]   I get that God can use other people of different abilities.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:13.040]   I get that God can use other people of different kind of personality traits, but you don't
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.320]   know my story, Andrew.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.540]   I'm an alcoholic.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.960]   I struggle with lust issues.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.560]   I'm cheating on my spouse right now.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.480]   I have anger issues that I can't control.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.440]   I lie on a regular basis."
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.680]   I mean, if you knew all the things that were happening in my life, you would realize that
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.680]   there's no different spirit in me.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.880]   You'd realize that that's for the other people in church.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.600]   I'm just going to come on a Sunday and just kind of slip in and slip out because I don't
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.840]   think I'm worthy of being a part of this grand idea of church that you're talking about.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.920]   I want to speak to you if you're feeling a little bit like that today.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.600]   I want you to know that there's nothing in this story.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.280]   Yes, God says to Caleb, "Well, he followed me wholeheartedly."
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.680]   There was a sense of Caleb's devotion and worship to God, but there's nothing in this
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.240]   story about how perfectly moral and ethical Caleb was.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:10.200]   In fact, I can tell you that probably Caleb was a man who struggled with stuff.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.920]   Caleb probably wasn't perfect.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:17.040]   Joshua definitely, as we will find out in his journey, was not perfect.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:23.240]   David, a man after God's heart, was a murderer, a rapist, and an adulterer.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.440]   When we see all of this in Scripture, it's there to remind us that even despite our brokenness,
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.880]   despite our sin, we can still be a part of God's alternative society.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.200]   In fact, actually, maybe our struggles are a part of the jars of clay, this broken and
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:44.040]   brittleness that actually when we admit the reality of our sin and our struggle, we release
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.560]   something of the power of God's grace.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.400]   Maybe a different spirit is at work despite the church's sin.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.960]   Now, listen to me.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.680]   I'm not soft on sin.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:02.040]   The Holy Spirit wants us to operate and to walk in a sanctification process.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:07.920]   I praise God that I'm not the sinner I was 10 years ago, 5 years ago, last month.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.440]   But I also recognize that I still carry sin in my life, and I'm on a journey of sanctification.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.400]   My heart is supple to the works of the Spirit.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   Here's the reality.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.200]   Your struggle and your sin does not give you an excuse to opt out of God's alternative
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.580]   society from holding a different spirit.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.880]   It's not about your moral perfection.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.720]   It's about God's glory despite it.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.760]   See a different spirit in the New Testament, if we center in on Jesus for a moment, it
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:47.280]   was all about this idea that He is everything, that the early church would be able to live
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:52.320]   the way they did in the empire around them by simply understanding that they have a God
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.600]   who is like this, one who was willing to come to the earth and die with it, one who was
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:03.600]   willing to resurrect around it, one who then returned to show us and gave us a spirit of
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.120]   life that that one is what they now stood up for.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.680]   So Peter radically transformed, could stand before his people of his day and be a different
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.680]   spirit.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.680]   Why?
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.800]   Just because suddenly, you know, Peter's got all these new gifts and abilities because
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.880]   Peter is suddenly not a sinner?
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.320]   No, because Peter realizes it's not about me.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.040]   It's about Jesus.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.800]   Because it's about Jesus, even in my brokenness, I can be a voice.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:36.120]   I believe God can heal this man.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.880]   I wonder whether we would be willing over the next seven weeks to stand over our city,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:48.560]   join hands together and declare, we believe God could heal this city.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.560]   That's a different spirit.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   Could you stand with me?
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   I want to pray for you.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:33:00.600]   I wonder whether you just open your hands with me as we pray.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:08.760]   Father, we come before you as a church, grateful for this invitation in this series to reflecting
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:14.440]   and thinking about what it is to live for Christ in this hour and in this time.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:21.040]   Father, we stand before you now, open hearts, open hands.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:30.280]   Father, some of us in this room, we rely far too much on our strengths and our abilities.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.280]   Some of us in this room think we're disqualified because we're not a certain personality type
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.720]   or profile.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.960]   Some of us in this room think we're disqualified because there's that sin that we continue
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.800]   to wrestle with.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.600]   Some of us think that if we could just try a bit harder, embrace some work a bit more
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:58.680]   and be driven by the law, we think we might get there, but the law will enslave us.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.600]   It sets us free.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:06.480]   And so we come, Lord, at the start of this series with our hands open before you.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.560]   Lord, I believe the Vine wants to be a church with a different spirit now.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.920]   I believe in this inflection point of the gospel you're calling this church to stand
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:25.360]   up and stand out, to be a church that's willing to declare the gospel, the saving knowledge
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.240]   of Jesus Christ to a hurting and broken world.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:37.280]   And Father, in all of our brokenness and all of our hope and strength, we now come to you.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:43.240]   We ask that your spirit would light a fire in us, and that as we journey in this series
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:49.120]   together, we would learn through the examples of Caleb and Joshua, all of the things that
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:55.760]   you're saying to us in this hour.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   Make us, Lord, ones with a different spirit.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.640]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.640]   Amen.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.640]   Amen.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.640]   Amen.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.640]   Amen.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.220]   (gentle music)
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.920]   [MUSIC]
