[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.900]   - Tim, I just feel for you that you come across,
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.900]   you're a big man physically, right?
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.980]   But this season, God is making you
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.120]   into the big man spiritually.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.540]   You know, so actually, let's not be just pulled off
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.000]   by just looking at him.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.780]   God is doing something inside of him, right?
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.220]   And might be the fasting, right?
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.460]   But this is your season,
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.340]   and God is making you into a spiritual giant
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.620]   as well as a physical giant.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.820]   Can I have amen to that?
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.660]   - Amen.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.320]   - Good.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.180]   Well, happy new year to everyone.
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.100]   Salud, Falak.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.460]   It's great to be here.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.600]   A new year is a new opportunity.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.640]   Vine Church, Yunlong,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.720]   you are about to enter into a new season.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.340]   It will not look like what you've known before.
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.620]   God says, "I will do a new thing."
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.180]   As someone who's had a relationship with the Vine Church
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.180]   for almost 30 years, I am indeed honored and privileged
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.540]   to be asked to say a few words on this special day,
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.080]   New Year's Eve.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.780]   And may I just say right up front,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.620]   what a wonderful year it's been.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.500]   From those months, those wonderful months preparing at EIS.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.340]   You'll remember those forever, won't you?
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.880]   It's amazing.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.880]   The prayer walks, the social events, the barbecues,
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.600]   the Vision Sunday, generous offering.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.940]   We're here today because on one Sunday this year,
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.180]   people were moved to give enough money
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.940]   to actually finance this church.
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.760]   The official launch and this wonderful building.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.860]   Beyond any of our wildest dreams,
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.380]   my first words, however, may be misconstrued
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.900]   as me being a bit of a killjoy.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.660]   Almost as you say, putting a dampener
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.120]   on this joyous occasion.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.100]   But I need to say them nonetheless.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.700]   The church is not a building.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.520]   You're allowed to say amen, by the way.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.580]   Any Pentecostals here?
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.420]   Yeah, good.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.660]   Church is not a building.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.040]   The church is not a building.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.020]   The word that Jesus was quoted as using
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.220]   that we translate as church, ecclesia,
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.820]   has nothing to do with a church building.
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.600]   But I think this conversation only goes to illustrate
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.380]   the confusion that many of us face
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.860]   with church being regarded as a place,
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.380]   as a building we go to, rather than a thing we are.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.660]   But in a sense, it doesn't matter
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.540]   whether we meet in a beautiful crystal cathedral
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.140]   or an old scout hut.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.660]   The church is us, the people of God.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.540]   And I believe that this highly impressive building
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.900]   here at Ho Sun Lee is a conduit,
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.540]   a conduit for us meeting together to thank God,
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.860]   to thank God for his faithfulness and goodness
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.220]   at the vine for almost 30 years
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.600]   and for this amazing past year here at Yuen Long.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.580]   But equally as important is to seek him
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.420]   for his presence in the present
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.940]   and to ask his guidance for the future.
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.980]   I believe this is one of possibly
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.540]   the most significant times in church history.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.780]   Give or take a percentage point,
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.900]   around 94% of Hong Kong's population
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.900]   are currently not part of any church.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.260]   Does that make you feel good?
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.700]   It doesn't make me feel good.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.860]   Many in our city, especially the younger generation,
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.180]   have lost hope.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.660]   We're seeing an increase in those suffering
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.700]   with mental health issues
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.940]   and an alarming rise in teenage suicides.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.740]   And in case you haven't noticed,
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.060]   our poor seem to be getting poorer.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.620]   What can we do?
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.140]   My friends, mark my words.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.500]   This building is significant,
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.580]   but not as an aquarium to keep the fish in,
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:30.100]   but as a launching pad for the lifeboats.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.860]   Can I say that again?
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.100]   A launching pad for the lifeboats.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.540]   Down those stairs and out there.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.820]   I see this building as an equipping center,
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.500]   equipping the saints to man the lifeboats
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.140]   to be sent to the lost,
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.820]   the lonely, those who've lost hope.
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.460]   And I believe there are many fish
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.460]   to be caught right here in Yuen Long.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.220]   I declare today that Yuen Long is a freaking village.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.060]   - Amen.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.460]   - An ocean full of fish ready to be caught.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.940]   As I prayed this week, I saw a picture.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.180]   I saw it in two halves.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.900]   The first half was about today.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.500]   The people of this church were gathered together
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   and we were like young eaglets in an eagle's nest.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.340]   Safe together, nestling in the mother's arms.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.820]   They were in close community with each other.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.060]   And I think that describes the Vine Yuen Long very, very well.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.100]   You enjoy wonderful community.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.900]   But in the second scene, the eaglets had grown.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.180]   And I saw squadrons of eagles swarming out from Hong San Lee
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.460]   to the people of Yuen Long,
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.300]   to the people of Hong Kong and beyond.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:19.300]   This building is to be that nurture place.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.820]   This building is to be that nurture place
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.220]   where, oh yes, you enjoy community
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.260]   and please go on enjoying community.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.180]   But where you are also prepared, trained,
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.860]   equipped to be sent to where the church of Hong Kong
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.860]   really is, in our offices, in our schools
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.060]   and the housing estates of our city.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:54.380]   And in that respect, I wanna share a verse.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.500]   It is the motivating verse for this message.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.380]   It is my prayer.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.420]   It is my dream for this church in 2024.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.740]   And I believe that this verse describes you.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.300]   The people who call Vine Yuen Long their home church.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.580]   It's Psalm 1,3.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:23.140]   That person, Tim,
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:28.660]   that person, Darius,
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.700]   is like a tree planted by streams of water
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.220]   which yields its fruit in season
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.860]   and whose leaf does not wither,
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.580]   whatever they do, prospers.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.780]   Now, read my lips for a moment.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:57.900]   There is no room in this church for spectators.
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.460]   Or to be on any church, to be honest.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.260]   Christianity is not a spectator sport.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:13.060]   The Psalmist has already told us this in verse one.
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.260]   Blessed is the one who does not walk in the step
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.420]   with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.500]   or sit in the company of mockers,
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.700]   but whose delight is in the law of the Lord
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.700]   and who meditates on his law day and night.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.780]   And can I just back up what Tim said about the fast?
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.740]   Fast is not about what you give up.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.940]   Fast is about what you gain.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.500]   Meditate on his word day and night.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.780]   And I will come back to blessing at the end of my talk.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.100]   But this got me thinking.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.820]   Everybody sort of wants a successful life.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.860]   Church is always talking about having successful ministries.
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.580]   But what is it?
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:09.620]   The promise of success here is qualified by the context.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.700]   Whatever they do and whatever they do will be determined
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.860]   by living in obedience to the scriptures.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.140]   Whose delight is in the law of the Lord
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.180]   who meditates on his law day and night.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.140]   That is what will prosper.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:32.740]   And what I wanna do now is move from,
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.060]   churches often talk about doing preaching verse by verse.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.540]   It's very popular in churches.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.460]   I'm gonna move to something
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.020]   which I'm gonna call word by word preaching.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.860]   And I wanna end up with six definitions of success.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.940]   This is my prayer for you for 2024.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.980]   And they are all in verse three.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.860]   And they are all linked to the sense
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.180]   of a tree being planted by streams of water.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.380]   And you will love this.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.300]   They all begin with the letter P.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:13.220]   Ironically, the world might come up with the same six P's.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.660]   But I want you to see them through the lens
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.740]   of a tree planted by streams of water.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.740]   Through as it were Psalm 1,3 tinted glasses.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.180]   And the first P is this prominence.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.220]   It says like a tree.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.620]   Trees are prominent.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.260]   To be prominent is to be widely known.
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:45.220]   We are to project outward from the line
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.660]   we started in our faith.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.340]   A tree is a prominent part of nature.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.740]   And I wanna say to you,
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.340]   it is not wrong to be prominent in the world.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:04.380]   Billy Graham was friends with 13 US presidents
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.060]   from Harry S. Truman to Donald J. Trump.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:14.020]   It is time to let our faith be known.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.540]   Can I repeat that?
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.020]   It is time to let our faith be known.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.820]   Always move forward.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.100]   We are to be bold like a tree.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:32.580]   Just like a tree is always growing, so should our faith.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.860]   No one's faith can stand still.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.980]   It either goes forward or backwards.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:43.900]   The second P is permanence.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.420]   The word is planted here.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.180]   This quality of the Christian life is crucial.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.940]   We need to be permanently planted in God's word.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.820]   We need to be permanent with our faith
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.540]   and not let anything shake us.
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.500]   We've been singing about that all morning.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.540]   Not let the things of the world shake us.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.700]   We are to be rooted by the word of God.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.620]   Rooted by the words of God.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.300]   That means if a decision comes up, a problem or a doubt,
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.340]   we should always refer to God's word for assurance.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.060]   This permanence gives us security.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.180]   There are just too many Christians out there
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.060]   who float in the wind
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.380]   and compromise their faith with the world.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:39.900]   We are to stand firm with security and permanence.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.060]   Then there is position.
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.260]   This is important.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.060]   It says here, planted by streams of water.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.780]   As important as it is to be planted,
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.940]   we must make sure we don't plant ourselves
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.380]   outside in a field that's gonna be chopped down
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.700]   by lumber workers.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:05.300]   We are to plant ourselves by streams of water.
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.060]   Water nourishes and feeds the tree
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.260]   to grow strong and permanent.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.780]   Just like the tree has water,
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.700]   we need God's word and God's Holy Spirit
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:24.740]   to nourish us, to feed us, and to counsel us.
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.380]   We need God's word, but we need God's Holy Spirit.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.780]   The fourth P is productivity.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.860]   The word here is fruit.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.140]   It will bear fruit.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.660]   When a tree is healthy, drinking water,
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.780]   and firmly planted, it doesn't only grow,
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.780]   but it bears fruit.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.980]   If we are reading and meditating on God's word,
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.180]   if we are being constantly filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.380]   if we are positioning ourselves in the correct area
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.580]   and firmly plant ourselves,
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.500]   we too will bear fruit for Jesus.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:06.220]   By our fruit, people will be able to tell
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.860]   what really matters to us.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.060]   I wanna ask you a question.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.620]   What is the fruit of your life?
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.220]   Do you have any fruit?
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.140]   Is your fruit sour or sweet?
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.340]   What type of fruit is your life producing?
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:28.980]   The fifth P is perpetuity.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:34.140]   It says the leaf does not wither.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.460]   We are to be in a state of being perpetual.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.260]   That is never ending for eternity.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.540]   Our leaf does not wither when life gets stormy.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.980]   We had a few typhoons this year,
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.940]   haven't we in Hong Kong, T10.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.580]   What happens to you when your life gets stormy?
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.660]   We need to look at trials.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.140]   We need to look at the typhoons in life
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.860]   as a test that will only make us stronger.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.700]   We cannot fold to harsh times and bad weather.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:16.060]   The leaf of God does not wither and we are the leaf.
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.900]   My friends, do not give in.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.900]   There will be times in 2024
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.020]   when every one of us will feel like giving in.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.780]   Do not give in.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.500]   My last P is prosperity.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.980]   It says whatever they do will prosper.
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.540]   If we abide in God, everything we do will prosper.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:48.300]   We may not always see it that way or even ever see it.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:54.780]   We must choose what we want our ministry on earth
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.620]   to be about.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.900]   Is it to be about us
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.740]   or is it to be about the generations to come?
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.340]   We need to leave a legacy for Christ, not our name.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.020]   That's my 2024 challenge to you.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.540]   Who are you leaving a legacy to?
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.900]   Who's coming after you?
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.300]   Who are you sowing into?
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.540]   I want to encourage each one of you to find someone
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.620]   that you can actually regularly find time
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.700]   to sow into their lives.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:35.300]   My 2024 prayer for you is for an intellectually
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.140]   excellent mind.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.260]   One is that is informed,
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.660]   one that makes important distinctions
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.900]   when a less mature mind fails to do so.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.980]   One that has deeper and deeper insights
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.580]   into issues of importance.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:56.300]   Be planted by streams of water.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.540]   Simple, be planted.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.860]   Who are the people you're spending time with?
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.380]   Where are you getting fed?
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.020]   Be saturated in God's word
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.100]   and saturated in God's Holy Spirit.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.060]   And you will be blessed.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:20.260]   Our church will be blessed.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:26.820]   And most importantly, our city will be blessed.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.340]   Our city will be blessed.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.620]   What I want to say as I'm moving towards a conclusion
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.940]   is I want to bless you.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.420]   I want to bless you dear church
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.300]   for the past, the present and the future.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:49.060]   As we come to the end of an eventful period in our history,
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.900]   the last word many of us might use
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.820]   to describe this period is blessing.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.140]   In fact, some other words might come to mind.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.260]   And yet blessing is an important aspect
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.980]   of our Hong Kong culture.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.180]   We see the character fuk or fu everywhere.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:13.700]   Meaning prosperity, fortune, good luck, happiness.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.980]   It's most popular amongst the young children
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.700]   and the unmarried when we get to licy time
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.860]   at Lunar New Year.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.980]   But fuk or fu can also mean blessing.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.700]   And we as Christians use it in our vocabulary
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.660]   with phrases like (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.580]   God bless you.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:41.380]   And blessing is also an important aspect of our faith life.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.900]   It's mentioned over 400 times in scripture.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.460]   In his song 10,000 Reasons,
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.460]   Matt Redmond encourages us, doesn't he?
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.300]   ♪ Bless the Lord, oh my soul ♪
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.220]   ♪ Bless the Lord, oh my soul ♪
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.100]   ♪ And all that is within me ♪
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.620]   ♪ Bless his holy name ♪
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.060]   From Psalm 103.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.780]   In the New Testament in Ephesians one,
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.340]   we read, "Blessed be the God and father
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.060]   "of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.500]   "with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places."
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.820]   Now that's a lot of blessing.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.820]   But it leads me very nicely to highlight three blessings
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:31.540]   that the Bible mandates.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.340]   I wanna take them one at a time.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.540]   The first one is this.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.980]   We are to bless God.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.980]   As Christians, we surely say God blesses us.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.460]   Even in these difficult past few years,
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.740]   God's blessings greatly outnumber the trials
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.620]   that came with virus, political unrest,
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.980]   and financial instability, without belittling
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.940]   or making light of the hardship that many of us have faced.
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:06.740]   But what does it mean that we can bless God?
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.460]   If God is perfect, how can we bless him?
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:17.580]   To bless God simply means to praise him
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.180]   or to honor his name.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:24.300]   The Hebrew word translated bless in the Old Testament
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.380]   literally means to kneel,
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.020]   indicating the idea of honoring the Lord.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.580]   We do not add anything to him when we bless him,
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.180]   yet we worship him as our appropriate response
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.620]   to say his greatness and his love for us.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:49.380]   As we saw earlier in the Psalms,
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.540]   we often find verses that speak of blessing the Lord.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.220]   Another example is found in Psalm 104, verse one.
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.940]   Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.900]   There it is again.
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.540]   O Lord, my God, you are very great.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:08.220]   You are clothed with honor and majesty.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.260]   So that's the first thing, we're to bless God.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:19.380]   And secondly, we are to bless each other.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.580]   We know that we have been so greatly blessed.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.780]   So many of us have been given so much,
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.460]   material goods, adequate incomes,
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.300]   families, friends, jobs, homes.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.700]   Being part of the vine year long
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.180]   is in itself a huge blessing.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.900]   That's just for starters.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:50.500]   If you are a Christian, then whatever your circumstances,
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.580]   you have been given the greatest gifts,
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.780]   faith, hope, and love.
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.740]   You have been blessed with the means of grace
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.300]   and hope of glory.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:09.300]   If you have Christ, you have been given everything
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.140]   that is eternally worthwhile.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:17.420]   So the big question is why?
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:23.260]   Why have I, why have you been so blessed?
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.140]   And the answer to that question is found in Genesis 12,
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.660]   verses two to three.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.300]   We call it the Abrahamic covenant.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.860]   This is God's promise to Abraham.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.060]   God said to Abraham, now bear in mind
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.900]   when God said this promise to Abraham,
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.460]   Abraham was about 90 years of age, right?
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.420]   His wife was barren and he had no kids, right?
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.060]   And he said, "I will make you a great nation
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.260]   "and I will bless you and I will make your name great
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:59.740]   "so that, so that,
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.260]   "so that you will be a blessing.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.180]   "I will bless those who bless you
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.180]   "and the one who curses you, I will curse.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.180]   "And in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:23.620]   God was saying to Abraham and is saying to us today,
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:29.860]   "I bless you, you bless others."
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.460]   Simple, I will bless you, yes.
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:40.380]   So that, so that you will bless others.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:45.100]   Can I challenge you today and every day
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:50.300]   to ask God, who can I be a blessing to today?
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:56.860]   A smile, can we try it by the way?
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.140]   Yeah, you can smile, good, a smile.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.980]   Do you know what it can mean so much?
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:11.340]   A kind word, an act of service.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.420]   Oh, by the way, can some people in Hong Kong
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.460]   start pressing the door open button on the left
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.220]   instead of door close button?
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.140]   That's a blessing.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.500]   Have you noticed, right?
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:26.820]   The door close button's worn out, right?
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.740]   The door open is pristine, right?
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.020]   No, nothing's on it, yeah.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.620]   Start blessing people by holding the lift for them.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.220]   That's a very simple one, right?
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:41.060]   A compassionate heart will share God's love
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.860]   with those who perhaps may be feeling overwhelmed
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.340]   by circumstances.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.860]   So we have to bless God.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.020]   We're to bless God and we are to bless each other.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:58.940]   And thirdly, we are to bless our city.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.300]   There's almost an amen there, good, I like it.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.740]   Proverbs 11, 11 says, "Through the blessing
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.060]   "of the upright," that's us,
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.320]   "Through the blessing of the upright,
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.220]   "a city will be exalted."
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.520]   Wow, stick this on your fridge.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.460]   Hong Kong is our home.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.740]   Its people are our family.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:32.860]   If we were to begin each day with a short prayer
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.700]   to bless Hong Kong, bless its people,
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.400]   and oh yes, bless the vine.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.260]   And bless every other church in our city as well
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.180]   at the same time.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:48.900]   I believe that we would very soon see a change
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.120]   in the spiritual atmosphere here.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   Dr. Ed Silvozo, a friend of mine,
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.760]   in his excellent book, "Prayer Evangelism,"
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.200]   how to change the spiritual climate
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.980]   over your home, neighborhood, and city,
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:10.680]   lists four steps based on Jesus' instructions
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.620]   to the 72 disciples in Luke 10.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.760]   He says this, "Number one, bless them.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.580]   "Number two, fellowship with them.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:26.220]   "Number three, take care of their needs.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.860]   "And then, at the bottom of the pile,
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.800]   "proclaim the good news."
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:38.820]   Step one is blessing.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.080]   Dr. Ed describes it as speaking peace to them.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:48.680]   He says, "Bless, befriend, care, share,
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.240]   "bless, befriend, care, share."
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.000]   How often do churches do it the other way around?
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.960]   We organize programs, courses, activities,
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.900]   where we should start by blessing.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.180]   So let's begin today.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:20.200]   I wanna finish by praying a priestly blessing upon you.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.920]   It's called an Aaronic blessing,
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.500]   after Aaron from the book of Numbers.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.320]   And we sang the song earlier, inspired Carrie Jobe
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.240]   and Cody Cairns to write the song "Blessing."
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.840]   There's been sung all around the world in many languages.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.300]   In fact, at the first service, we sang it in Cantonese.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.720]   We're gonna sing it again in a few minutes.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.560]   And I invite the band to come back and you to stand, please.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.000]   I wanna give you the reference point.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.220]   It comes from Numbers 6, 24 to 26.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.780]   It says, "The Lord bless you and keep you.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.440]   "The Lord make his face to shine upon you
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.820]   "and be gracious to you.
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.720]   "The Lord lift up his countenance upon you
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.000]   "and give you peace."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.020]   You might remember at the beginning of the sermon,
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.980]   I started a little bit controversially
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.000]   by talking about the church building.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.480]   And I'm gonna finish on a similar controversial thing.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.460]   I love this song, but whenever I hear it sung in church,
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.160]   we always sing it wrong.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.800]   I see what I see, we sing this song.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.540]   I see congregation members with their eyes closed,
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.480]   maybe their arms raised singing to God.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.160]   This is not meant to be sung to God.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:55.180]   We are meant to be singing this to each other.
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:30:00.880]   It is not, "Bless the Lord, O my soul."
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.640]   We might do that afterwards.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:09.280]   So what I'm proposing in line with my three points,
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.600]   all good sermons have three points,
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.240]   is this, in a moment we're gonna pray a prayer
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.060]   to bless God.
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.420]   It's right to do that.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:26.560]   Then as we sing the verse, "The Lord bless you."
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.560]   The Lord bless you.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.200]   I'm gonna suggest we just sing it to each other.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.040]   Ivan.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.600]   ♪ The Lord bless you and keep you ♪
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.120]   We sing it to each other.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.560]   Now this is a little bit strange, you know,
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.920]   particularly those that are Englishmen,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.320]   you know, don't like this sort of thing.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.160]   The Lord bless you.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.720]   We're gonna sing this to each other.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.800]   We're gonna rejoice in this as we sing it to each other.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.360]   In 2024, we're going to a new year
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.680]   and we're singing over each other,
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.600]   "Lord bless you and keep you."
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.520]   For the second time we sing it,
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.120]   we're gonna face the outside world.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.720]   We're gonna face you and Long.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.440]   For one easy way we go there,
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.000]   I know you and Long's that way and that way,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.680]   but we've got stairs here.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.520]   And we're gonna sing out over you and Long.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.640]   You and Long, the Lord bless you.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.880]   Yeah, we're gonna do it.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.860]   We're gonna sing over our beloved city.
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.560]   By the time you get to the amens,
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.320]   and there's loads of those,
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.720]   anything might be happening.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.360]   But what we're gonna do is this.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.800]   We're gonna bless God.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.120]   We're gonna bless each other.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.480]   And we're gonna bless our city.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.600]   Can I hear amen to that?
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.440]   That was three of you.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.280]   Let's try it again.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.360]   Can I hear amen?
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.000]   Let's pray.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.520]   Now this is the bit you can close your eyes for.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.160]   I'm just telling you.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.540]   You haven't got to look at anyone else.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.400]   Dear God, we bless your holy name today.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.200]   Thank you for your goodness.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.480]   Thank you for your crown of steadfast love and mercy.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.440]   We recognise all that you have done for us as a church
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.320]   and for every church in this city.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.240]   And all that you continue to do now
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.280]   and all that you will do in the future.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.700]   In Jesus' name.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.640]   Amen.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.480]   Bless you.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.000]   Let's get ready to sing.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.400]   To each other.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.800]   Wow.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.640]   Ready, here we go.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.640]   [MUSIC]
