1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 I'm surrounded by people, this is amazing.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,600
 How's everyone doing?

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,380
 If you're new to the Vine, welcome.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,280
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,960
 We're so, so glad that you are with us today.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,320
 When I was 14 years old,

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,200
 I very, very nearly drowned to death.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,000
 It's actually a moment in my life

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
 that still causes me great trauma

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,320
 when I think of water, even to this day.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,160
 I nearly, nearly drowned to death.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,800
 I was at Waterworld at Ocean Park at the time.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,640
 Now, this is not, ladies and gentlemen,

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,320
 this is not the new Waterworld

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,280
 that you're all familiar with today.

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,240
 The Waterworld where they finally realized

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,080
 that there is such a thing

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,920
 as occupational health and safety.

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,680
 This was back in the '80s and '90s, right?

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,160
 The '80s and '90s where, as a 14-year-old kid,

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,580
 we would go to Waterworld and that place was rugged.

22
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,660
 I mean, that was down to earth.

23
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,880
 This was the OG of water parks.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,560
 And there was a lot of things

25
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,920
 that you could get up to in that place

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,160
 where it was pretty dangerous.

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,560
 But the ride that was the most favorite

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,920
 for everybody was the Raging River.

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,960
 Now, hands up if you ever did the Raging River

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,160
 in the old OG water park.

31
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,040
 Come on!

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,400
 You survived.

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,920
 I almost didn't survive.

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,020
 Let me tell you the story.

35
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,680
 So the Raging River was this crazy water slide

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,280
 where everybody was given a big, large, inflatable ring.

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,680
 And you sat in the ring,

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,720
 like you sort of jumped up inside the ring,

39
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,960
 and you sat in the ring,

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
 and your bum was kind of in the hole, right?

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,020
 And you sat there nice and comfortable holding onto it.

42
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,860
 And the Raging River was basically a network

43
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,920
 of small little pools and slides, big, large slides,

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,660
 that went down the side of this mountain.

45
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,640
 Now, what you would do is you'd sit

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,680
 in your little kind of inflatable ring,

47
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,880
 and you would slide down a slide,

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,680
 and then you would end up in the next pool.

49
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,480
 A few of you would gather in the pool,

50
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,520
 and then you would slide on down to the next one,

51
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,960
 and so on and so forth until you got to the bottom.

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,960
 Now, this slide had an inherent danger to it.

53
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,400
 The inherent danger was what would happen

54
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,800
 when too many people would gather in one of the pools

55
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,520
 before going down to the next one,

56
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,660
 and there were people up in the pool above

57
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,840
 wanting to come down into their pool,

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,160
 and the danger would be what would happen

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
 if somebody slid down and sort of crashed

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
 into everybody that was in the pool below.

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,640
 Does that make sense?

62
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,100
 And then that was gonna create a problem.

63
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,440
 So Waterworld realized they had an inherent danger

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,000
 in their mechanism of the slide,

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,400
 so they hired a bunch of young men.

66
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,320
 These guys look like triads.

67
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,960
 There's no other way of saying it.

68
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,400
 A bunch of triads basically were hired,

69
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,760
 and they wore dark sunglasses, and they had walkie-talkies,

70
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,860
 and their job was basically to tell you

71
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,400
 when you could go down the slides and when you couldn't.

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,600
 So their job was to kind of go,

73
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,320
 okay, there's too many people in the pool right now.

74
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,440
 Everybody up there, stop,

75
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,680
 and then they would let some people down

76
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,600
 and make some space and that so forth.

77
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,240
 Now, on this one particular day,

78
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,340
 me and my mates were in the raging river.

79
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,680
 Now, one of the things that we loved to do

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,960
 was to be dangerous.

81
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,800
 And how we were dangerous was we would dare each other.

82
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,480
 Like, whichever pool seems to be the busiest,

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
 I dare you to slide on down,

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,080
 even if the triads tell you not to, right?

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,200
 And this was the whole thing.

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,880
 Like, we would dare each other all the time.

87
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
 Well, on this one particular day,

88
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,600
 we're up in one of the pools,

89
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,000
 and we're looking down at the pool below.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,540
 Now, we had never seen the pool so full.

91
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,460
 Maybe 15 kind of inflatable rings

92
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,680
 would have already have filled the pool,

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,280
 but there was probably like 20 or so inflatable rings,

94
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,720
 people in there already in this pool.

95
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,480
 And it was so full that none of my friends

96
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,560
 had the courage to give it a go, except me.

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,280
 And I looked down on that pool,

98
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,280
 and I was like, this is my time to shine.

99
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,120
 This is my moment of glory.

100
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,440
 This is my moment to show my friends

101
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,080
 that I'm the bravest and the strongest

102
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
 and the craziest of them all.

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,260
 And so although the sun shades, walkie talkie guys

104
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,040
 were saying to us, don't go,

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,920
 I kind of looked left, I looked right,

106
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,240
 and I grabbed my ring and I jumped down onto the slide.

107
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,180
 I actually went down like this, head first, like this.

108
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,200
 Have you ever had a moment in your life

109
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,240
 where you start something, and like the momentum kicks in

110
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,560
 and you realize you can't back out anymore,

111
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,800
 but you immediately realize that you made a mistake?

112
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,480
 Have you ever had a moment like that in your life?

113
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,760
 This was that moment for me.

114
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,320
 As soon as I started on that slide,

115
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,840
 I realized I have made a big, big mistake.

116
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,200
 The guys that were down below in the pool,

117
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,360
 there was this one man, and he was the one

118
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,720
 who was closest to the slide, right?

119
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,480
 And so he's sitting there, and he looks up,

120
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,060
 and there's this crazy guilo kid

121
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,720
 like barreling down at him head first.

122
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,120
 Now, he does something that I did not expect

123
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
 that he would do.

124
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
 Normally what would happen when we did this

125
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,640
 is we would slide down into the full pool below,

126
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,520
 and they would not know what to do,

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,120
 so we would hit them and fly up over the top of them,

128
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,800
 and it was kind of funny for us, not for them.

129
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
 This guy, I don't know whether that's happened

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
 to him before or not, but he sits there.

131
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,640
 He realizes there's this crazy kid coming down the slide,

132
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,560
 so he does this.

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,040
 He leans a little bit, and he lifts up his donut like this,

134
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,640
 lifts up his ring like this.

135
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,600
 What that means is he suddenly creates

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,600
 a little pool of water where Andrew flies in head first,

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,280
 and rather than bouncing up on top of them,

138
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,000
 which is what I was planning to do,

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,680
 I suddenly found myself in the pool under them.

140
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,040
 I looked up, and I had a ceiling of bums above me,

141
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,520
 bums from everywhere, and they were packed in there

142
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
 so much that I realized immediately

143
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,280
 there was no way for me to escape.

144
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,320
 I mean, there was no way for me to get up and out

145
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,200
 to get breath, and immediately I was in a place of panic.

146
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,120
 I literally thought this is how I'm going to die,

147
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,480
 and as I'm there, and I'm beginning to panic,

148
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,820
 and I'm realizing that there's just no way

149
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,620
 I'm gonna escape this, I notice the smallest of details,

150
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,040
 the smallest of details that normally

151
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,560
 you wouldn't even kind of bother with or even see,

152
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,560
 but I recognize the smallest of details

153
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,820
 that would actually end up saving my life.

154
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,980
 Do you know what it is?

155
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,380
 I remembered I had a knife in me, and I could stab,

156
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,380
 no, that's not what happened, I didn't remember that.

157
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,720
 (audience laughing)

158
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,300
 The smallest detail was this.

159
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,460
 As I looked up at this sea of bums,

160
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,460
 I saw a very, very small one, a really small bottom,

161
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:39,900
 and I realized that this was my chance to escape,

162
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,740
 that if I could somehow position myself

163
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,500
 in the water underneath this small little bum,

164
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,060
 I'm assuming that a child was sitting there,

165
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,180
 I might be able to burst up and push the child out,

166
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,380
 and burst up to the middle of their ring

167
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,820
 and grasp ahold of the air

168
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,960
 that I desperately needed for my lungs.

169
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,300
 I'm not proud to admit this,

170
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,340
 but I got under that small little bum,

171
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,300
 and I pushed up as hard as I could,

172
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,660
 and the kid went flying, and Andrew burst up

173
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,820
 through the inside of the ring, (gasping)

174
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,100
 grasping for air, and I went from death to resurrection.

175
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,700
 (audience laughing)

176
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,400
 Now, thank you, thank you.

177
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,880
 The kid was fine, by the way,

178
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,060
 I don't wanna get any emails from anyone later on

179
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,140
 going like, "Hey, child abuse!"

180
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,260
 Kid was fine, okay.

181
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,180
 But here's the thing I learned that day.

182
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,340
 I learned a very important lesson.

183
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,460
 I didn't learn the lesson

184
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,100
 that it's dangerous to play with water,

185
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
 although that is a good lesson to learn.

186
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,980
 I didn't learn the lesson that you should listen

187
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,700
 to people in authority with walkie-talkies,

188
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,460
 although that also is a good lesson to learn.

189
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,660
 That day, I learned this, that sometimes in life,

190
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,060
 the smallest of details has the biggest of impact.

191
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,800
 The thing that you probably would mostly ignore normally,

192
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,720
 the thing that doesn't maybe seem a big deal to anyone,

193
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,740
 can actually be the thing that opens up for you

194
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,660
 the greatest of possibilities.

195
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,400
 Case in point is the Easter story itself,

196
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,140
 as presented by John in his gospel.

197
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,160
 The beautiful thing about Easter that we have as Christians

198
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,120
 is that we get four different versions

199
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
 of the Easter empty tomb narrative

200
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,460
 from four different writers.

201
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,980
 And John, writing a little bit later than the other gospels,

202
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,120
 captures for us a detail that no one else captures,

203
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,860
 mentions something that no one else mentions,

204
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,980
 a small little thing that when you're reading the passage,

205
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,020
 you might actually just kind of pass over it

206
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,940
 and not look at it much at all,

207
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,900
 but actually when you sit with it for a moment,

208
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,380
 opens up the beauty and the wonder

209
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,020
 of what Easter is really all about.

210
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,420
 And so I wanna read you the story,

211
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,580
 and I wonder whether as I read it,

212
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,620
 you might be able to capture

213
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,620
 what this small little detail is.

214
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,780
 This is John chapter 20, just the first eight verses.

215
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,220
 Early on in the first day of the week,

216
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,180
 while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb

217
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,080
 and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.

218
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,740
 So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple,

219
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,820
 the one who Jesus loved, and said,

220
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,180
 "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,

221
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,900
 "and we don't know where they have put him."

222
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,900
 So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.

223
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,700
 Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter

224
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,180
 and reached the tomb first.

225
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,580
 I love the fact that he wants that recorded

226
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,620
 for all the history.

227
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,920
 I won the race.

228
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,060
 He then says this,

229
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,540
 "Then Peter, who was behind him,

230
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,520
 "arrived and went into the tomb,

231
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,800
 "and he saw the strips of linen that were lying there,

232
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,820
 "as well as the burial cloth, or the burial shroud,

233
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,200
 "that had been around Jesus' head.

234
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,440
 "The cloth was folded up by itself,

235
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,580
 "separate from the other linen.

236
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,120
 "Finally, the other disciple,

237
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,780
 "who had reached the tomb first,

238
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,380
 "also went inside.

239
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,680
 "He saw and believed."

240
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,920
 The little detail that John mentions here

241
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,800
 that none of the other gospel writers mention

242
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,640
 is this thing.

243
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,740
 Let me read it to you again.

244
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,740
 He says, "There was a burial shroud

245
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,660
 "that had been around Jesus' head,

246
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,740
 "and the cloth had been folded up by itself

247
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,220
 "and separated from the other linen."

248
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,720
 John mentions a burial shroud,

249
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,560
 which again, kind of is a small little detail,

250
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,260
 but in this small thing comes such wonderful possibilities.

251
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,440
 A burial shroud was pretty much something like this

252
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,320
 that I have here on the table.

253
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,540
 It was a cloth that was placed over the face,

254
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,140
 the head and the face, of the person who had died.

255
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,400
 Now, it was usually a little bit of a thicker cloth

256
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,020
 than the other linen strips.

257
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,840
 Notice that John mentions linen strips

258
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,860
 that were also there.

259
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,120
 The linen strips were the ones

260
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,520
 that wrapped around the body.

261
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,880
 They were very thin kind of linen material.

262
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,960
 The burial shroud was a little bit heavier of material,

263
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,120
 and it was placed over the face

264
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,680
 or the head of the person who had passed away.

265
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,920
 Now, why was this placed over the face of the person?

266
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,360
 Well, the burial shroud signified

267
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,720
 a couple of different things.

268
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,240
 It signified, first of all,

269
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,840
 that it was kind of like covering up the face

270
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
 as a way of sort of protecting

271
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,980
 or covering the person's identity

272
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,520
 so that they would have dignity in death.

273
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,940
 So it was like just kind of covering them

274
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,000
 in a way of providing some dignity for them.

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,640
 The second reason why the burial shroud

276
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,000
 was placed over the face was because in many cases,

277
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
 maybe there was an injury to the face

278
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,280
 or something had happened to the head.

279
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,040
 In Jesus' case, of course, that was the reality

280
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,920
 with the crown of thrones that had been on him,

281
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,560
 and so they cover up the head to protect the head wounds.

282
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,720
 The third thing, but the most important reason

283
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,680
 why the burial shroud was placed over the face

284
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,040
 was because it signified the reality

285
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,900
 that that person had actually died.

286
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,600
 The burial shroud was a sacred cloth

287
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,980
 that was only used in this instance

288
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,960
 to basically say this person has passed from life to death.

289
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,920
 A little bit like how perhaps in the modern time

290
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,320
 and in our modern age, we might take somebody

291
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,200
 who has passed away and close their eyes,

292
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,760
 just kind of do that little close the eyes thing,

293
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,720
 saying this person has passed from this life to the next.

294
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,780
 That's what the burial shroud represented.

295
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:11,100
 So when John says to us that there is this burial shroud,

296
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,160
 he's wanting to draw attention to the fact

297
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,460
 that death has occurred.

298
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,360
 Now this is really important

299
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,120
 because when John's writing his gospel,

300
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,000
 remember it's later than the other gospel writers,

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,240
 and by the time John's writing his gospel,

302
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,920
 the people, the Jewish people of the day

303
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,380
 are basically saying, we don't think Jesus ever died.

304
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,220
 Maybe he was on the cross and maybe he sweated that blood

305
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,380
 and maybe all that happened, yeah,

306
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,560
 but maybe he didn't actually die on the cross

307
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
 and so when he got put into the tomb,

308
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,720
 he was actually still alive.

309
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,040
 And that's the reason why he was able to get up and escape.

310
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,680
 Or other rumors that were spreading at the time was this,

311
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,220
 oh, maybe he faked his death.

312
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,080
 Yeah, the disciples, they faked the whole thing.

313
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,060
 It wasn't really true, it wasn't real,

314
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,200
 no one really saw it, no, he escaped and ran off.

315
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,280
 And John says, no, you need to understand

316
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,320
 that there is a burial shroud

317
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,960
 that was around this man's face

318
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,480
 and no one placed a burial shroud on anyone

319
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,040
 unless they had confirmed that they were really dead.

320
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,780
 So for John, this is a big deal.

321
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,760
 It might seem like a small detail to us,

322
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,580
 but it's a much bigger impact than what we might realize.

323
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,800
 This is saying, no, Jesus was dead

324
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,180
 and it was important for John and his audience

325
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,740
 to understand that that had taken place.

326
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,140
 But then he mentioned something else.

327
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,760
 He doesn't say that the burial shroud was there.

328
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,520
 He said it had been taken up,

329
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,300
 that it had been folded up,

330
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,820
 and it had been placed separately

331
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,420
 from the other strips of linen.

332
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,980
 Again, another small detail we might easily pass over

333
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,560
 when we've read this a million times,

334
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
 but John is trying to communicate something

335
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,020
 that's gonna help the people connect

336
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,140
 to something that was significant on the Easter story,

337
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,900
 folded up and separated from what they think else.

338
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,480
 And the question John wants you to ask

339
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,480
 as you're reading his narrative is, why did that happen?

340
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,260
 Well, to understand that, I wanna unpack for you

341
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,320
 actually a bigger story,

342
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,160
 not just a story of the death and resurrection of Jesus,

343
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,360
 but a story that goes way back

344
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,440
 to the beginning of all things.

345
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,220
 700 years before the empty tomb experience that John has,

346
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,120
 something happens for Israel, the nation.

347
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,560
 At that moment in history, Babylon,

348
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,880
 which was the largest empire of that time,

349
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,540
 who lived on the east side

350
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,020
 of where Israel's land was at the time,

351
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,920
 came in and actually attacked the Jewish people.

352
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,760
 They stormed into Jerusalem,

353
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,080
 they destroyed the temple that was on Mount Zion,

354
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,440
 they killed many of the Jewish people at that time,

355
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,520
 and they took a remnant of the people

356
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,360
 out into captivity and exile in Babylon itself.

357
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,640
 And the Bible tells us that for 70 years,

358
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,200
 the Jewish people were in exile in Babylon.

359
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,920
 And this was the darkest time for Israel

360
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,080
 in maybe all of their history.

361
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,200
 This was a time where they were wrestling

362
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,080
 with the realities of so many things

363
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,620
 that were going through their mind.

364
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,480
 They were wrestling with,

365
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,760
 why has God allowed this to happen?

366
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,120
 Why has God come and done this?

367
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,960
 What has taken place?

368
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,640
 And now that the temple is destroyed,

369
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,200
 where is God's presence on earth?

370
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,760
 'Cause that's where they believe God's presence dwelt,

371
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,240
 and the Babylonians had come in and destroyed the temple,

372
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,640
 and suddenly they were asking these questions,

373
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,400
 where is God then?

374
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,120
 'Cause if God doesn't reside in his temple,

375
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,760
 where now is our Lord?

376
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,120
 And they're in exile in Babylon,

377
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,060
 and so much of the writing at this time

378
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,480
 is them crying out and saying,

379
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,080
 why have you forsaken us, God?

380
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,320
 Why have you left us?

381
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,720
 Why have you parted from us?

382
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,960
 And as they're beginning to think this,

383
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,700
 they also have this other revelation.

384
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,160
 They realize that the reason why they're in exile

385
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,160
 in the first place is because of their sin,

386
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,880
 their brokenness.

387
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,520
 Because they had acted and done,

388
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,080
 and had treated their God in ways

389
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,200
 that they should not have done.

390
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,780
 And this has placed them in a place

391
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,860
 where they now are in exile,

392
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,220
 and they realize that this is largely

393
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,880
 because of the brokenness found within them.

394
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,460
 Which opens up for us another big story,

395
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,720
 the story of humanity's brokenness itself.

396
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,200
 The Bible explains that story by linking it

397
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,080
 to the first humans, Adam and Eve,

398
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,440
 created by God to be in relationship with Him,

399
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,840
 relationship with themselves,

400
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,280
 relationship with one another,

401
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,040
 relationship with His creation.

402
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,920
 Genesis 1 and 2 pitches us this beautiful picture

403
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,120
 of what Shalom looks like

404
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,880
 between God and humanity perfect together.

405
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,240
 And God tells Adam and Eve just one thing not to do,

406
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,680
 just like a little 14-year-old boy,

407
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,520
 the one thing you're not supposed to do

408
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,120
 is go down that slide into the next pool.

409
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,580
 The one thing He told them not to do,

410
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,400
 take of the fruit of the knowledge of the tree,

411
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,340
 and good and evil.

412
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,120
 Well, we all know the human story, don't we?

413
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,840
 Us humans, if you tell us not to do something,

414
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,640
 it's the first thing we're gonna do.

415
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,120
 Adam and Eve take the fruit that they should not have done.

416
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,680
 The Bible tells us that this story

417
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,720
 of humanity's brokenness begins at that point.

418
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,960
 And the Bible's very clear that that brokenness happens

419
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,400
 in basically those four essential relationships,

420
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,840
 our relationship with God,

421
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,480
 our relationship with ourselves,

422
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,680
 our relationship with the others around us,

423
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,160
 and even our relationship with creation.

424
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,180
 And there's a brokenness and a heaviness

425
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,560
 that's now come into all spheres of that area in our lives.

426
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,640
 And the Bible says from Genesis 4 onwards,

427
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,360
 it's the story of humanity

428
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,240
 wrestling with the heaviness of the sin,

429
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,760
 knowing what it is to breaking that relationship

430
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,760
 with God, themselves, with others in the world,

431
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,880
 and the heaviness that comes on them in that reality.

432
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,300
 And the rest of the biblical narrative's a fascinating story

433
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,140
 because it's a story of God's people

434
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,560
 wanting to be back in relationship with Him,

435
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,460
 and yet realizing that their own efforts

436
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,380
 and their own ability to do that will never be enough.

437
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,980
 They realize that they're the ones

438
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,980
 that broke that relationship, but they can't restore it.

439
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,980
 That's only gonna be God.

440
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,180
 God's gonna have to do something

441
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,900
 to help restore that relationship

442
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,660
 because it's way beyond their ability.

443
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,820
 And this brings us back to that moment 700 years

444
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,580
 before the tomb was empty,

445
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,100
 where Israel's in captivity in Babylon,

446
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,780
 and it's there for the first time they go,

447
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,000
 we need God to do something new.

448
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,140
 We need Him to step in.

449
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,060
 We can't try to create this in our own strength anymore.

450
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,200
 We are useless.

451
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,500
 No, God has to come in His compassion and His love

452
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,120
 and change it all.

453
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,700
 So it shouldn't surprise us that in this moment,

454
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,820
 700 years before Jesus' empty tomb,

455
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,660
 God begins to speak through prophets,

456
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,100
 and He tells these prophets a vision

457
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,740
 and a dream of what's gonna happen.

458
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,580
 And each prophet has a different perspective

459
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,100
 and a different, broader and wider dream.

460
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,520
 And in this moment, God calls one prophet.

461
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,300
 In this incredible, dark time of Israel's history,

462
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,500
 one prophet named Isaiah.

463
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,900
 And Isaiah begins to get this amazing vision

464
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,420
 of what the world might be like when God comes

465
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,180
 and steps in and changes everything.

466
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,240
 And I wanna read to you the vision he gets

467
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,000
 right at this time of exile for the Jewish people.

468
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,580
 It's found in Isaiah.

469
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,820
 It starts in chapter 25,

470
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,060
 and I wonder if you can hear this as I speak it.

471
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,860
 He says, verse seven, Isaiah 25.

472
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,900
 "On this mountain, He will destroy the burial shroud

473
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,780
 "that enfolds all the people,

474
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,620
 "the sheet that covers all nations.

475
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,860
 "He will swallow up death forever,

476
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,540
 "and the sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears

477
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,660
 "from all faces.

478
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,040
 "He will remove the distance from people

479
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,140
 "from all the earth,

480
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,140
 "for the Lord has spoken.

481
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,180
 "In that day, they will say,

482
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,940
 "'Surely this is our God.

483
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,320
 "'We trust it in Him, and He saved us.

484
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,800
 "'This is the Lord.

485
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,100
 "'We trust it in Him,

486
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,180
 "'and we rejoice and be glad in His salvation.'"

487
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,620
 Can you hear what Isaiah says

488
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,460
 700 years before the resurrection of Jesus?

489
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,220
 God gives him a picture of what sin for humanity is like.

490
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,740
 And here's how Isaiah describes it.

491
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,660
 He's like, "It's like a burial shroud

492
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,580
 "has been placed over us,

493
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,720
 "like a sheet has come and been placed

494
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,100
 "over all of humanity."

495
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,340
 And in this prophetic vision,

496
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,960
 he sees humanity shrouded in death, essentially,

497
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,980
 with that burial shroud over their faces,

498
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,100
 over their heads,

499
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,580
 covering them like you would someone who's died.

500
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,640
 And it's Isaiah's beautiful prophetic way of saying,

501
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,460
 "Don't you realize that this is what sin does to us?"

502
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,820
 The Bible in the New Testament would say it elsewhere.

503
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,860
 It would say that the wages of sin is what?

504
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,460
 Is death.

505
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,820
 And so the burial shroud,

506
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,620
 which had always signified the passing of something,

507
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,580
 Isaiah sees it over all of humanity,

508
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,780
 like that heavy cloth placed upon us,

509
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,200
 which makes it hard for us to see anything.

510
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,520
 We can kind of make out vague shapes,

511
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,820
 but not really see as we were supposed to see,

512
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,420
 the weight of it over our heads, pulling down upon us,

513
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,660
 this beautiful poetic imagery is what Isaiah is saying,

514
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,440
 "Humanity's sin and brokenness is like."

515
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,740
 So stick with us for a moment,

516
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,020
 'cause I think that's something

517
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,780
 that we can all resonate with, right?

518
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,220
 I think in many ways,

519
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,860
 no matter what kind of life you may have led,

520
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,680
 we can all recognize the heaviness

521
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,080
 that life creates for us at times,

522
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,820
 the brokenness that is so present for us.

523
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,060
 And perhaps for some of you, as you've come in today,

524
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,980
 this resonates with you.

525
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,980
 You know what it's like to wear a bit of a shroud

526
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,040
 over your head, if you will.

527
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,460
 You know the heaviness of life,

528
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,760
 the hardship and the challenges.

529
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,700
 Perhaps for some of you,

530
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,340
 it's because of what others have done to you.

531
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,060
 Perhaps you've been hurt.

532
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,460
 Perhaps somebody else's brokenness has broken you.

533
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,340
 Perhaps words have been shared, things have happened.

534
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,860
 Maybe someone's done something to you

535
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,460
 that's caused a lot of trauma and hardship in your life,

536
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,180
 and it feels like there's a filter now over your life.

537
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,100
 Or perhaps for some of us, we resonate with it

538
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,000
 because we know of our own actions.

539
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,060
 We know that we've hurt others.

540
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,940
 We know that despite the fact that we didn't want to,

541
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,040
 words came out of our mouths, or actions happened,

542
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,420
 or things took place,

543
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,720
 and we know we've broken others because of it.

544
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
 I think we all resonate, don't we,

545
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,860
 with the reality that the shroud can cover us,

546
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,140
 that the heaviness of the cloth can be around us,

547
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,060
 that the weight of it can push down upon us.

548
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,900
 We can all wrestle with that.

549
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,940
 I think we can all connect with it.

550
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,820
 And this is why Isaiah is sharing it,

551
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,660
 because he's like,

552
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,940
 "This image kind of fits for all of us, doesn't it?"

553
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,860
 But then he says this beautiful thing.

554
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,980
 He says, "I see a time in the future

555
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,460
 "when God will act, and the burial shroud,

556
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,880
 "the sheet that covers all peoples and nations,

557
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,700
 "will be destroyed.

558
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,740
 "It will be removed."

559
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,180
 The word destroyed there, guess what it means?

560
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,460
 Actually, if you look at it in the Hebrew

561
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,860
 and you break it down, it means to be set aside.

562
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,300
 He says, "There's a time coming in the future

563
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,340
 "where the burial shroud will be set aside,

564
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,620
 "where it will be destroyed once and for all."

565
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,940
 And he says this is gonna happen

566
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,540
 for all peoples and all nations.

567
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,380
 I love that.

568
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,660
 You see, Isaiah could have just played to the crowd.

569
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,500
 He could have just said,

570
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,020
 "Hey, this is gonna happen for us Jewish people.

571
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,540
 "This is good news for all of us Jewish people."

572
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,820
 But he doesn't say that.

573
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,420
 He says, "This is for all people.

574
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,060
 "For all nations."

575
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,820
 Like no matter what other cultural background,

576
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,140
 no matter who you are, if you're a human being,

577
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,980
 this is good news for you, Isaiah is saying.

578
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,780
 He's saying God has taken the burial shroud,

579
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,700
 that heaviness that weighs upon you,

580
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,860
 and he's removed it and he's placed it away,

581
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,500
 and you can have fresh life, all peoples on earth.

582
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,560
 You see, the liberation of God is not a half liberation.

583
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,520
 You know, a liberation just reserved

584
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,020
 for the special few of us.

585
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,740
 It's a liberation for all people and all nations.

586
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,020
 The sheet has been removed.

587
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,620
 Anyone who trusts in him, it is gone.

588
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,020
 That is the powerful message of Easter.

589
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,500
 That's the wonder and the beauty

590
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,300
 of what we sit in this room today

591
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,020
 to praise and to be thankful for.

592
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,980
 Not something that happened some 700,000, 2,000,

593
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,140
 2,500 years ago for other people,

594
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,860
 but something that's happened for all of us

595
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,860
 right here and right now.

596
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,300
 This is why Isaiah fills this with beautiful imagery

597
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,580
 in terms of the liberation that comes for us all.

598
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,480
 Notice what he says.

599
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,740
 He says, "The sovereign Lord will wipe away every tear.

600
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,740
 "He will remove the disgrace from his people.

601
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,700
 "He will save us."

602
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,020
 Oh, what beautiful thoughts.

603
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,780
 He's gonna wipe everything away.

604
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,220
 He's gonna liberate the shame and the disgrace

605
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,100
 that sits on us because of the things that we've done

606
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,380
 that we're not proud of, and he's going to save us,

607
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,060
 bring us that salvation.

608
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,740
 It's a call to the wonder of a God

609
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,060
 who can change everything.

610
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,980
 So stick with us all and come back to me

611
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,800
 and come back with me to John chapter 20.

612
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,660
 Notice what John says.

613
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,620
 He says, "When I walked in there,

614
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,160
 "when I arrived in the tomb,

615
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,260
 "I saw the strips of linen lying there

616
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,280
 "as well as the burial shroud

617
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,580
 "that had been around Jesus' head,

618
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,160
 "and the cloth now was folded up by itself

619
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,720
 "and separated from the other linen."

620
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,720
 John is giving us a very small detail

621
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,300
 that has a massive impact.

622
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,400
 He's saying that that shroud that was around Jesus' head

623
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,980
 has been folded up and set aside,

624
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,080
 not just 'cause it says something about Jesus,

625
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,140
 because it says something about the biblical story

626
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,980
 of all time.

627
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,300
 It actually links to what Isaiah had prophesied

628
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,940
 700 years before that God's people had been longing

629
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,660
 for the day when God would step in

630
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,380
 and deal with sin once and for all,

631
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,660
 that the burial shroud that was around us all

632
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,700
 would be lifted off and separated and destroyed

633
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,620
 so we would know the fullness of love,

634
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,660
 the fullness of forgiveness, the fullness of life.

635
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,320
 And he says, "I saw it and I believed."

636
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,980
 He said, "I made the connection

637
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,120
 "between Isaiah's prophetic vision

638
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,680
 "and God's work in Jesus,

639
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,780
 "and I no longer saw Jesus as just a good moral leader.

640
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,420
 "I no longer saw him as just some prophet of old.

641
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,380
 "I now see him as the Son of God."

642
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,500
 The burial shroud has been set aside.

643
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,160
 I love the word he uses here in the Greek.

644
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,140
 It's the word folded.

645
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,300
 He said, "It's folded," which interestingly is the same

646
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,260
 if you read the Old Testament in the LXX,

647
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,280
 which is the Greek version of the Old Testament,

648
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,700
 the word that Isaiah uses to speak of the unfolding

649
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,540
 of the shroud around all people.

650
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,140
 It's the same root word.

651
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,220
 So here's John making this beautiful theological connection

652
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,680
 to the language he's using.

653
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,780
 What was once enfolded over all of humanity

654
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,660
 has now been folded and separated and set apart.

655
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,500
 Destroyed.

656
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,460
 And where the Bible says that the wages of sin is death,

657
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,140
 Easter tells us that death is not the final story.

658
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,320
 That death is not how this thing's all going to end up.

659
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,960
 That actually, here's what's gonna happen.

660
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,500
 Every tear is gonna be wiped away.

661
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,900
 All that shame is gonna be removed.

662
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,340
 The salvation will come for anyone

663
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,060
 who would put his trust in him.

664
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,020
 The beauty of Easter is the celebration

665
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,300
 of a new time has embarked in this world.

666
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,420
 A new time has come.

667
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,740
 This is why Jesus, when he's on the cross, cries out,

668
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,880
 it is finished.

669
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,140
 That old story is done.

670
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,380
 The shroud has been lifted.

671
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,540
 Death is not a definition of humanity anymore.

672
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,300
 Yes, we will all die at some point,

673
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,780
 but death is not the full stop.

674
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,660
 It's merely a comma because Jesus rose again.

675
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,660
 And you're gonna rise again.

676
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,580
 And you're gonna be filled with new life

677
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,340
 and have eternal hope and salvation and joy

678
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,660
 in the presence of God.

679
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,740
 John enters the tomb and believes

680
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,720
 because he sees the shroud has been destroyed.

681
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,700
 It's a beautiful, powerful, poignant picture

682
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,940
 of what can take place through the resurrection power

683
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,880
 of Jesus Christ.

684
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,480
 And I love this because it welcomes us into a thought.

685
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,160
 A thought that this kind of freedom and liberation

686
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,020
 is not reserved for just those

687
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,620
 that have done something special throughout all of history,

688
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,500
 but it's actually something available for all.

689
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,880
 Our baptism candidates in just a little bit

690
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,080
 at 4.30 this afternoon, that's what they're celebrating.

691
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,200
 They're celebrating that their burial shroud

692
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,800
 has been removed.

693
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,220
 And they're going down publicly

694
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,280
 into the waters of Repulse Bay,

695
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,480
 the beautiful, dirty waters of Repulse Bay.

696
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,460
 (congregation laughing)

697
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,020
 And they're gonna be washed clean

698
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,060
 by the waters of the Spirit of God, amen?

699
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,780
 And it's not just our baptism candidates

700
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,140
 that are celebrating this.

701
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,920
 Millions of Christians around the world

702
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,080
 are celebrating this on this very day,

703
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,280
 that their own burial shroud has been removed

704
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,340
 because of what Jesus has done on that cross.

705
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,260
 And I want you to know this,

706
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,860
 that that's also what has happened for you too,

707
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,260
 whether you've ever realized it or not.

708
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,660
 Perhaps for some of you here, this is a new story.

709
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,580
 It's a new idea, but you resonate and connect with it

710
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,900
 because you felt that heaviness

711
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,740
 and you know what that burden of life can feel like.

712
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,580
 And maybe this is the first time you're ever hearing

713
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,740
 that something has taken place

714
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,740
 that has removed that heaviness and that burden from you.

715
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,660
 Jesus put it this way in the gospels.

716
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,780
 He said, "Anybody who's weary and tired,

717
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,080
 who's overburdened, who's worn down,

718
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,300
 you can come to me and I will give you rest."

719
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,100
 And he says, "My yoke is light, my burden easy."

720
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,060
 In other words, the heaviness of that shroud

721
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,660
 has been lifted, it has been removed,

722
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,160
 and therefore there's a new story for you.

723
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,060
 What is that new story?

724
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,660
 Well, interestingly, if you actually go back

725
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,020
 into the Isaiah passage,

726
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,880
 you'll see something quite beautiful.

727
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,660
 See, Isaiah doesn't just speak of this moment

728
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,180
 where the burial shroud was lifted.

729
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,460
 In the very same passage, he speaks about something else.

730
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,820
 Let me read this to you in verse six.

731
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,780
 He says, "On this mountain, the Lord Almighty

732
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,820
 will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples,

733
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,300
 a banquet of aged wine, the best of meats,

734
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,320
 and the finest of wines for all the people."

735
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,620
 You see, the imagery that the Bible uses

736
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,580
 to talk about the fact that the burial shroud

737
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,700
 has been lifted is a table filled with harvest,

738
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,860
 a place of abundance that anyone can come to

739
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,780
 and partake in a meal that will give them life.

740
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,980
 Isaiah, having seen the burial shroud getting lifted

741
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,300
 some 700 years before the work of Jesus on the cross,

742
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,100
 then sees a picture of a banqueting table

743
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,460
 filled with the finest of food and the greatest of wine.

744
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,820
 And he says, "Isn't it amazing that the end of our story

745
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,000
 is not the burial shroud, but a table filled with abundance,

746
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,760
 that we get invited into a greater narrative

747
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,500
 than the one that we thought our humanity

748
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,780
 had invited us into?

749
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,460
 The table has been set."

750
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:13,420
 And this imagery of a table that's filled with abundance

751
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,920
 and fruitfulness and wonder and looks really good to eat,

752
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,940
 that story becomes the central narrative

753
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,840
 that the Bible uses to talk about the work

754
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,020
 of salvation in Christ.

755
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,260
 Jesus himself, at the beginning of the gospel,

756
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,260
 in his announcement of himself as more than just a prophet,

757
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:39,060
 he starts his ministry at a wedding in Cana,

758
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,700
 and a wedding banquet is there, and they run out of wine,

759
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,220
 and Jesus says, "Bring me, just bring me the ceremonial pots

760
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,420
 that are filled with water."

761
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,820
 And he's like, "I will show you that the greatest

762
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,540
 of all wine will be poured out for anyone to enjoy."

763
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,460
 And this beautiful picture of what this wine is like

764
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,140
 is really Jesus already before he sheds his blood

765
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,220
 on the cross saying, "This is what it's gonna be like.

766
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,580
 We're all gonna gather around an incredible table,

767
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,400
 and we're gonna feast for all eternity,"

768
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,460
 because this is the picture of what God is.

769
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,420
 God is not an angry despot who's filled with wrath

770
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,380
 and wanting to punish everybody.

771
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,180
 No, God is an abundant, glorious, loving, faithful father

772
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,540
 who sets the table for any prodigal son and daughter

773
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,880
 to come and partake with him.

774
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,180
 The burial shroud has been destroyed.

775
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,020
 Let me put it this way.

776
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,340
 The burial shroud has become a tablecloth,

777
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,940
 and that tablecloth now is a welcome to anyone

778
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,060
 who would put their trust in him.

779
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,440
 In fact, at the end of the biblical narrative,

780
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,660
 right at the end of the story,

781
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,060
 this is how the Bible finishes.

782
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,260
 Let me read this to you from Revelation 19.

783
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,980
 I love how this puts it.

784
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,040
 "Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude,

785
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,620
 like the roar of rushing waters

786
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,820
 and like the loud pearls of thunder, shouting,

787
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,940
 'Hallelujah, for our Lord God Almighty reigns!

788
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,620
 Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory,

789
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,060
 for the wedding banquet of the Lamb has come,

790
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,460
 and his bride has made herself ready.

791
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,740
 Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear."

792
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,580
 I love this.

793
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,200
 Revelation pitches the endable things,

794
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,980
 and they picture this wedding banquet of the Lamb,

795
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,320
 and it's saying that there's a great multitude of people

796
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,860
 who are welcome to this.

797
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,160
 And notice what it says.

798
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,700
 It says, "The burial shroud,"

799
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,540
 basically it doesn't say this,

800
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,140
 but the burial shroud has been set aside,

801
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,000
 "and new linen has been given."

802
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,800
 Because the bride is the church.

803
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,360
 The bride is those that have put their trust in Jesus Christ,

804
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,320
 and we're now wrapped up in fresh, bright, clean linen.

805
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,660
 Burial shroud destroyed.

806
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,160
 New linen, and a banquet given.

807
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:49,400
 So for you, the smallest of details

808
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,820
 can actually create the biggest of impact.

809
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,980
 A burial shroud set aside that actually draws us

810
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,240
 into the wonder of what this whole celebration is all about,

811
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,760
 and a table set in abundance for you.

812
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,640
 Let me challenge you here if you're a Christian.

813
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,160
 If you're a Christian,

814
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,980
 this whole thing is a challenge, I think.

815
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,440
 Because I think it's easy sometimes for us Christians

816
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,260
 in our relationship with Jesus

817
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,300
 to have those ups and downs that we have with Him,

818
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,540
 and sometimes think that He's the God of the no,

819
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,720
 that He's a God that holds back,

820
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,500
 that He's not coming through with the things

821
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,460
 that we want Him to come through for.

822
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,520
 And we might have a picture of the table

823
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
 that He sets before us, and it's barren.

824
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,000
 And if you feel a little bit like that as a Christian,

825
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,500
 that your relationship with Jesus

826
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
 is a little barren right now,

827
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,300
 that maybe because of some disappointments,

828
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,980
 or because you thought something would happen,

829
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,580
 or He would do something and it didn't feel like He did it,

830
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,540
 when you look at the table,

831
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,660
 you don't see a lot on that table at all.

832
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,900
 You look at a table of lack.

833
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,180
 I think the challenge of Easter is to tell you

834
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,540
 that actually it's a table of abundance.

835
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,380
 And perhaps for some of you

836
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,840
 who have been Christians for a long time,

837
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,760
 this is a challenge to you.

838
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,780
 Can you see your picture with the Lord?

839
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,780
 Can you see the table like this for you?

840
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,660
 If you're not a Christian here, we're so glad you're here.

841
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,460
 And I hope that maybe something that I've shared

842
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,420
 this afternoon or this morning has really challenged you,

843
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,900
 or maybe just opened yourself up

844
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,740
 to thinking about life slightly differently.

845
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,820
 And this invitation maybe has resonated with some of you.

846
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,940
 Maybe like me, you know what it is

847
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,740
 to feel the heaviness of life and the burden of things.

848
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,540
 Maybe that brokenness has been there for you,

849
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,460
 and maybe it's even resonating for you in this moment.

850
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,060
 And the wonder of Easter is that

851
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,460
 that burial shroud has been removed,

852
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,620
 and that just simply through trust in Jesus.

853
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,340
 Remember John standing on the outside of the tomb,

854
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,340
 and he knows, man, if I go inside there,

855
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,740
 and if I see the thing that I think I'm gonna see,

856
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,060
 then I'm gonna have to believe.

857
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,180
 Perhaps for some of you in this room,

858
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,580
 you're feeling it in your spirit right now.

859
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,620
 You're feeling your heart beating.

860
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,220
 You know that this might be the moment

861
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,580
 where you've come to a place

862
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,260
 where you're willing to put your trust in Him,

863
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,360
 your life in His hands.

864
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,200
 I'm not gonna promise you

865
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,520
 that life is suddenly gonna be easy.

866
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,980
 It's gonna be rainbows and butterflies.

867
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,620
 No.

868
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,500
 Sometimes when we give our lives to Jesus,

869
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,940
 things get challenged even more.

870
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,300
 Jesus described walking with Him like a narrow path,

871
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,300
 not a big, broad one.

872
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,900
 But He says it's a narrow path that leads to life,

873
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,260
 eternal life, the hope of forgiveness

874
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,860
 and the glory of restoration.

875
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,300
 And so I wanna pray for you.

876
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,620
 I wanna pray that perhaps

877
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,420
 that might be your journey here today.

878
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,740
 So I wonder whether we would all just bow our heads

879
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,380
 as we come into a time of prayer.

880
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,820
 Father, I'm so grateful for each person

881
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,660
 that's here in this room,

882
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,620
 that those that are watching online,

883
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,140
 those in our overflow.

884
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,580
 Lord, I'm grateful that we get

885
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,580
 to come around the table today together.

886
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,540
 And Lord, first of all,

887
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,780
 we thank you that the burial shroud has been removed.

888
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,580
 We thank you, Lord, that it's been set aside.

889
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,420
 It's destroyed.

890
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,180
 And Lord, we thank you that in the fact

891
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,420
 that you did that in the death and resurrection of Jesus

892
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,860
 now provides for us a open tomb

893
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,300
 that asks us whether we will enter and believe.

894
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,100
 Father, for the Christians here

895
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,860
 where perhaps they feel like their table is not abundant,

896
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,900
 perhaps they struggle to see the overflow

897
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,460
 of what's on this table in this moment

898
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,140
 in their relationship with you.

899
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,340
 I wanna pray that this Easter

900
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,980
 would be a breakthrough for them.

901
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,740
 I wanna pray that you would, Lord,

902
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,220
 bring them back to the abundance of your love

903
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,260
 and your heart and your grace.

904
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,740
 Lord, I wanna pray for breakthrough

905
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,100
 for those Christians here

906
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,820
 who need to see the table more full.

907
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,020
 And I pray that they would see

908
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,500
 that you have done everything

909
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,620
 and you've wrapped them in white, fresh linens.

910
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,420
 And I pray that they would find great joy

911
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,380
 in their relationship with you again here on Easter Sunday.

912
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,820
 And Father, I pray for anyone here

913
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,780
 who perhaps when they came in today

914
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,740
 would say that they weren't a Christian.

915
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,380
 And if that's you, I just wanna invite you

916
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,500
 just to this moment of just reflection.

917
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:05,740
 Lord, God loves you so much.

918
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,100
 No matter how hard things have been,

919
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,780
 no matter how difficult life is,

920
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,340
 he's here for you in this moment.

921
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,820
 And his invitation is the same as it was for John

922
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,140
 some 2,000 years ago.

923
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,300
 He's welcoming you in to believe.

924
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,300
 And he's saying, will you come in and believe today?

925
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,220
 And I know that for some of you in this room

926
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,340
 and watching online right now,

927
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,860
 this is gonna be a life-changing moment for you.

928
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,820
 As you come to just put your trust in him,

929
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,300
 the Bible says that we come into relationship with God

930
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,940
 as we repent and believe.

931
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,700
 The word repent just literally means

932
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,260
 to ask for God to cover us in his love,

933
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,740
 to recognize that we've hurt people

934
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,180
 and hurt ourselves at times,

935
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,100
 to even recognize that we've hurt him

936
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,620
 and to ask for forgiveness.

937
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,580
 And then out of that place of just recognizing

938
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,300
 the forgiveness that we have in a loving, merciful Lord,

939
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,780
 we then have the celebration and the joy

940
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,420
 of knowing that eternal life is before us.

941
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,660
 And so I wanna pray for any of you here today

942
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,020
 where that might be your journey.

943
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,340
 And what we wanna do is in a moment,

944
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,540
 we're gonna pray a prayer all together.

945
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,380
 And if you're praying that prayer for the first time,

946
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,020
 we want to invite you to come up

947
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,500
 and connect with us after the service,

948
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,820
 myself or other team members.

949
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,300
 We'd love to just talk with you about next steps

950
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,220
 and what living a life with Jesus is.

951
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,020
 You know, a life with Jesus is not just a decision

952
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,500
 you make in a service, that's the starting point.

953
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,020
 But it's actually a discipleship journey

954
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,540
 of great abundance and love and joy.

955
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,540
 And we wanna come around you and help you with that.

956
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,060
 So as we're all just heads bowed, eyes closed,

957
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,580
 I want us to all to pray this prayer.

958
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,700
 And if you wanna invite Jesus into your life

959
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,300
 for the very first time,

960
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,460
 then this is the prayer that you're praying to do so.

961
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,100
 But we're all gonna pray it as an encouragement together

962
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,340
 as the body of Christ.

963
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,380
 So let's pray this prayer.

964
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,940
 Pray after me, Lord Jesus,

965
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,860
 I wanna thank you for dying for me and for raising again.

966
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,580
 I thank you that the tomb was empty.

967
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,780
 And Lord, we thank you that the burial shroud

968
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,300
 that has been over me has been set aside.

969
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,780
 Set aside because of Jesus.

970
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:31,540
 Father, I ask that you would forgive me in this moment.

971
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,980
 Forgive me for the ways that I've hurt you,

972
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:42,380
 that I've hurt myself and that I've hurt others around me.

973
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,140
 And I thank you that you forgive me.

974
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,900
 And in this moment, I pray you would give me now

975
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,540
 your spirit, your Holy Spirit,

976
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:02,980
 filled with love, grace, strength for life ahead.

977
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:08,980
 And I thank you that I now have eternal life in you.

978
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:16,020
 Help me to walk every day in the humility of your service.

979
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,820
 Your service.

980
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,420
 And I pray this in Jesus' name.

981
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,620
 Can we put our hands together for anyone

982
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,420
 that may have prayed that prayer for the very first time?

983
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,740
 (congregation applauding)

984
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,940
 The beautiful thing.

985
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,340
 Would you stand with me?

986
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,820
 And we're gonna finish our time together

987
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,100
 with just one more response in worship

988
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,460
 as we celebrate the beauty and the wonder

989
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,300
 of what the Lord has done amongst us.

990
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,900
 (gentle music)

991
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,500
 (gentle music)

992
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:54,500
