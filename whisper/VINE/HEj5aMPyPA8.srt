1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 God is unshakeable, He is unchangeable.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,520
 Whether it's powers or thrones or dominions,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,560
 nothing can shake who He is.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,120
 Nothing will change the things that He has set up.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,000
 So if God is for you,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,460
 who can be against you?

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,560
 If God is for you, if God has called you His,

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,560
 who can change that?

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,420
 Prophet Isaiah would say that the things His hand sets forth, no one can change. Our God is

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,200
 unchangeable. He is unshakeable.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,920
 So no matter what storms may come, no matter what winds and waves might throw at us,

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:51,000
 He remains unshakeable. And here's the good thing, we are found in Him.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,800
 So if you are in Christ Jesus,

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,360
 that means it doesn't matter what comes against you, because you are in

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,760
 God, because you are built on a rock that does not shake, you will be okay.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,640
 Because He is okay,

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,080
 you too will be okay.

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,840
 God, we thank you for all these qualities that we find in you.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,800
 That you are a God that doesn't change. That you are a God that doesn't move. That you are a God that cannot be

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
 moved around, tossed around

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,160
 because of a circumstance, because of a situation, God.

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,200
 But you remain the same God that you were yesterday, that you are today, that you will be forever.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,200
 And that's the God that is full of love and full of mercy. A God that desires to know us.

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,640
 A God that loved us so much that He would send His Son

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,820
 to redeem us back to Him. We thank you that you are that God.

26
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,720
 We thank you that those things still hold true.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
 And

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,600
 God, we thank you that we are found in you.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:06,880
 So for anyone here this morning who might feel like the waves are big and the situations you in are challenging and troubling,

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,560
 I bet they are, but you have a God that is unshakable.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,560
 And if you will be found in Him,

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,160
 He will see you through.

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,160
 We thank you for that truth.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,480
 In Jesus' name.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Amen. Amen. Amen.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,800
 Thank you team.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 Well, good morning everybody. Good morning 11 o'clock service. Good morning overflow. I know you're outside, but I think you can see me.

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
 Here's a camera. Good morning anyone online.

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,800
 Again, happy Mother's Day to all the moms in the room and all the moms in the foyer and all the moms in the

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,960
 online, all the mothers everywhere. We love you guys and we're thankful for you.

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,960
 I am Pastor Promise and today we are going to be continuing a

42
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,680
 great series in the book of Ephesians looking at a pretty

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,960
 pretty big concept. It's gonna require quite a lot of scripture reading.

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,840
 So I'm gonna go ahead and dive right in. If you have your Bibles in your old school,

45
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,160
 you can open that. If not, you can pull out your phone. If you don't have your phone, which I think you all do,

46
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,600
 it'll be on the screen.

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,880
 But go ahead and just take a look and I'm gonna read this out to us. Starting in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 1.

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,600
 It says this, "For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles,

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,620
 surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you.

50
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,360
 That is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I've already written briefly. In

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,200
 reading this then you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,

52
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,400
 which was not made known to people in other generations as it has been

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,540
 revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.

54
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:54,260
 This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members

55
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:00,060
 together of one body and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.

56
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,820
 I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given to me through the working of his power.

57
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,220
 Although I am less than the least of God's people,

58
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,960
 this grace was given to me to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ and to make it plain to everyone the

59
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,780
 administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God who created all things."

60
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,900
 Now starting at verse 10, 11, and 12 will be where we will focus today.

61
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,820
 It reads like this, "His intent was that now

62
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,340
 through the church the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and to the authorities in the heavenly realms,

63
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,740
 according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. In him, through faith in him,

64
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,740
 we may approach God with freedom and confidence.

65
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:49,820
 I ask you therefore not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory." Church, pray with me.

66
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,420
 God, we come before you this morning and we open your word

67
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,300
 knowing that you desire to speak to us, knowing that you desire to shape and mold us by your truth.

68
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,340
 So Holy Spirit, I pray that you begin the work of focusing our minds and our attentions on you now.

69
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,660
 Pray that against any distractions, any things that might come to mind, God, would you help us to focus?

70
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,620
 Would you help us to hear you open our ears, open our hearts?

71
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,740
 And God, may we be transformed by the truth found in your word. It's in Jesus name we pray, amen.

72
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,740
 Well, church, that was 13 verses. That was very long.

73
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
 So I'm gonna condense it and summarize it

74
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,900
 really briefly, kind of laying up for you what this passage is saying and the things that we're gonna be talking about.

75
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,200
 So I'd say it this way, that the mystery of the reconciliation of all humanity to God,

76
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,900
 so God and humanity reconcile, the mystery of that and

77
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,340
 is displayed through the church,

78
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,620
 illuminating the power of God,

79
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,380
 revealing his wisdom to the world.

80
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,260
 So through the church, the wisdom of God will be made manifest to the whole world.

81
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,180
 They'll see something. Last week in chapter 2 of Ephesians, Pastor Ellison walked us through these

82
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,780
 contents that actually end up being the building block for everything that Paul's gonna talk about today. The idea of

83
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,220
 reconciliation. Before I go any further, let me define what reconciliation means so that we are familiar with the term.

84
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,140
 So to reconcile something is when there are two things that are apart that are opposing that are no longer working together

85
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:23,540
 harmoniously, to bring them together, not just side by side, not just in the same place, but at peace,

86
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,140
 unified, working together for a common purpose,

87
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,380
 reconciled together. I heard from so many people, whether it was online,

88
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,380
 by the way, I'm the one with the Instagram, with the church's Instagram,

89
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,780
 so I see all of your reposts and whatnot.

90
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,740
 There were quite a few of you that reposted some really interesting stuff from Ellison's sermon.

91
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,540
 So it felt like last week's sermon really hit home, a timely message on

92
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,140
 reconciliation and the challenge that it is for us to get our grasp and to really live out

93
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,300
 reconciliation. It was a challenge for us to think about the prejudices that we might personally hold

94
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,400
 that we may not even know are there and how that might affect other people. Pastor Ellison taught us that in Christ, there's no outsider.

95
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,680
 Everyone is welcome. So it doesn't matter if you're Jew or you're Gentile, everyone is welcome.

96
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,900
 If that's the case, then we as the church cannot limit our

97
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:21,100
 acceptance and our love and our generosity and our hospitality to just those that look like us, to those that we're most comfortable with.

98
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,540
 But actually the gospel is for everyone, for Jews and for Gentiles.

99
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,300
 So that means we have to be intentional about calling out our prejudices that might go unseen.

100
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,100
 This is truly what it looks like to love your neighbor.

101
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,940
 All right, that was what Ephesians 2 landed us on. So Paul's gonna take that concept from Ephesians 2,

102
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,700
 he's gonna build further upon that in Ephesians 3, especially in verses 1 through 10, kind of

103
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,660
 repeating some of the similar language that, you know, through Christ

104
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:54,020
 there's no longer a barrier that God has brought these two groups together as one new humanity, one new people.

105
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,260
 That the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus was to call humanity to himself.

106
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,460
 Not just to Israel, not just to one person.

107
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:11,500
 So Paul is highlighting this mystery and he's clarifying to the church, showing us that this is actually why he's in prison.

108
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,980
 This is what got him in trouble in the first place.

109
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:20,300
 He was a Jewish man teaching Gentiles about a Jewish God, but actually wasn't a Jewish God,

110
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,820
 it was a God for everyone. This is why he would be in prison at that moment.

111
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,940
 And all this to say that the way you and I live

112
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,580
 out this truth will truly impact our day to day.

113
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:38,020
 If we are called to live and love one another with dignity, with respect, with compassion,

114
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,140
 it was a groundbreaking concept to become at peace with people that were different.

115
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:48,060
 All right, this was something completely new to the Jewish people. They felt like the chosen people.

116
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,220
 They were quite special. Now all of this is about to change. And Paul's gonna take chapter 3 and

117
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,820
 expand not just on what this change is, but he's actually gonna help us understand the theological

118
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,420
 frameworks that have been laid out from the beginning of the Bible all the way to this point as to why God is doing

119
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,540
 such a thing. So starting in verse 10, Paul will do this by introducing to us the church.

120
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:16,180
 All right, and it's here that Paul will define what the church is and what God's purpose is through the church.

121
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,660
 So I'll read Ephesians 3 again starting at verse 10.

122
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:25,300
 It says this, "His intent was that now through the church the manifold wisdom of God should be made known."

123
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,020
 So observe and notice a couple of components here.

124
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,420
 As Paul talks about the church, notice some subtle differences in what he's saying about the church and

125
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:42,820
 potentially some of the beliefs that we carry about church. Notice how Paul doesn't speak or refer to a program.

126
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,460
 Notice how Paul doesn't specify Sundays or a building.

127
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,460
 Or a location.

128
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:56,780
 No, Paul actually speaks about a people. When Paul speaks about church, he uses the word

129
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:03,380
 "ekklesia" which is a Greek word describing a gathered people, a called-out assembly, a congregation.

130
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:10,500
 So stay with me. What we've heard so far about Jews and Gentiles now being brought together as this new humanity, all of this is

131
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,940
 on purpose and it's all

132
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,440
 expected to be expressed in the assembly called the church.

133
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,560
 Called out and assembled under the banner of Jesus. See all this time God had a bigger picture.

134
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,400
 So if we trace back to theological frameworks,

135
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,440
 we know that God introduces himself to a man named Abraham.

136
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,120
 And he speaks to Abraham and he makes a promise to Abraham. And out of Abraham, God reveals himself to the people of Israel.

137
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,920
 And that's the massive kind of what's happening in the Old Testament.

138
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,800
 He would set Israel apart and he would send Jesus to come and to redeem and reconcile them, bringing them to salvation

139
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,440
 in him and redeeming their relationship.

140
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,320
 But here's the thing, God's plan was never to stop at Israel.

141
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,440
 His plan is always to go beyond that.

142
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,920
 Right? So if we look back at Abraham's covenant,

143
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,040
 we would see that the contents of his covenant, if we look at it, actually give us a bit of a foreshadowing to this.

144
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,600
 Yes, God would bless those who would bless Abraham and he would protect Abraham and take care of him.

145
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,640
 But he also said this at the very last bit of the covenant. He would tell Abraham this, "And through you,

146
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,800
 I will bless all the nations."

147
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,880
 So from the very beginning, God's plan has always been to bless all people.

148
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,440
 God was not going to stop with just blessing one group of people. God's heart was not just for one group of people.

149
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,280
 God has desired all of humanity. Paul would say it in this way. He would say, "According to his eternal purpose."

150
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,040
 This has always been the plan. This is actually nothing new. Scripture has been saying this for a while.

151
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,680
 What's the most famous passage in Scripture is, "For God so loved the world."

152
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,400
 In the New Testament, it's an epistle. Peter would say that he would desire that all

153
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:58,720
 would come to the knowledge of God. That all would be saved. That God is drawing back and reconciling all of humanity to right standing with himself.

154
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,400
 That's the mystery that's shown. That's why Paul uses this word mystery in verses 6 through 10.

155
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,440
 Emphasizing that it was something that was hidden, but actually is now being made clear.

156
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,320
 So I think when the first century church would have heard and read this letter,

157
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,400
 they would have had questions as to, "So how?" Like, "In what way?"

158
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,800
 Because you're not just saying, you know, "Be at peace and don't hate certain people that are different than me."

159
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:29,400
 You're saying that you are combining us. You are grafting us into one family, into one unit, into one new humanity.

160
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,680
 How is that supposed to take place? What does that even look like? I feel like those would have been the questions.

161
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,720
 These guys who were deeply rooted in their Jewish customs are probably wondering,

162
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,200
 "Do we need to change these people to be more like us?"

163
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,920
 I think Pastor Ellison said circumcision 14 times in three minutes last week,

164
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,400
 talking about the uncircumcised and the circumcised, right?

165
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,480
 "Do we need to change them to become like us?"

166
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,400
 Paul would say, "No, that's not what God is doing. He's not making Gentiles Jewish.

167
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,760
 At the same time, he's not making the Jewish people into Gentiles."

168
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,600
 No, God is actually putting together this combination, this bringing together, this called out assembly,

169
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:12,200
 this unified new humanity that consists of both the Jews, those who are different than the Jews, and the Jews themselves.

170
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:18,400
 And the way that he's going to do that, the new gathered community that he's going to do that within,

171
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,400
 the place it's going to take place is within the church. That's here, within the church.

172
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,480
 So this speaks real significance to what the church is supposed to be, that the church matters,

173
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,680
 that the church is important, and if the church is important,

174
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,680
 then we've really got to understand what exactly is this gathered community meant to be?

175
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,880
 What is it meant to do? What's the purpose of it?

176
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,480
 Yeah, God's gathered all these people with different backgrounds together, but for what reason?

177
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,480
 The church matters and is important, so we've got to understand that it's not just about singing and worshipping and listening to a good sermon,

178
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,080
 but if the church is going to have an impact in the place that it's planted within this city,

179
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,880
 then we've got to really know the heartbeat of God for the church.

180
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,480
 And that's what I hope that we'll be able to see through Ephesians through today.

181
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,680
 The first thing we can look at and understand is that this, the church is actually God's idea.

182
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,280
 It wasn't something that some clever person came up with on their own.

183
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,480
 This is something that God designed. We could say it like this,

184
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,680
 the church is a community made up of people of different backgrounds and tribes and every tongues,

185
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,680
 all redeemed by the blood of Jesus and right standing, reconciled with God.

186
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,280
 And that would be a really good theological statement, right?

187
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,680
 All these people reconciled into good and right relationship with God. That would be good.

188
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,480
 But as beautiful as that statement is, it's actually incomplete.

189
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,880
 That's not just what it's all about.

190
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,880
 See, the life and the death and the resurrection of Jesus was, yes, to reconcile and redeem us back to God,

191
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,680
 but it had a bigger purpose.

192
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,080
 See, if we trace back to biblical narrative a little bit further,

193
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:52,280
 we would look back in Genesis 3 and see that at the fall, when sin entered the world, quite a few things happened, right?

194
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,080
 So probably the most obvious thing we recognize is that Adam's relationship,

195
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,280
 humanity's relationship with God is broken, right?

196
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,080
 When God shows up to Adam, what happens? He hides.

197
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,080
 For the first time, he hides from God. The relationship is now broken. It's tumultuous.

198
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,080
 He doesn't know how to even engage with God. He hides himself.

199
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,680
 But what about humanity and humanity, Adam and Eve? What happens to Adam and Eve?

200
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,680
 Their relationship pre-fall is different than the relationship post-fall, right?

201
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,280
 Before the fall, they are united. They are one flesh. They are unified together.

202
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:30,880
 They become one person. When sin enters the world, what does Adam do when God asks him questions?

203
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,680
 He pushes Eve under the bus. He says, "That woman that you gave me," he didn't say I sinned.

204
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,880
 He said, "The woman that you, her, she did it. It's her fault."

205
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,480
 He distances himself, and you see the first example of a broken relationship within humanity.

206
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,680
 Within the next generation, you would see their two children, Cain and Abel,

207
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,480
 and one would murder the other. From the sin entering into the world,

208
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,280
 there's been a brokenness in humanity with one another to where peace has been so difficult to obtain.

209
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,280
 And so we have to understand that Jesus' life and his death and his resurrection

210
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,880
 didn't just serve one purpose, to reconcile me and him, or to reconcile you and him.

211
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,480
 Actually, the work of Jesus is significantly more vast than that.

212
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,680
 What Jesus came to do was also to reconcile humanity to one another.

213
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,080
 Right? Sin left humanity broken and in a war with each other.

214
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,080
 But Christ has come to reconcile us to him and to reconcile us together.

215
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,880
 And so Paul will peel back the layers of this, explaining how this new humanity

216
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,280
 that's now reconciled with one another is meant to exist and to be expressed

217
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,280
 primarily through the church, primarily through this. Right?

218
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,680
 The church is meant to be evidence to the world of something.

219
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,280
 It's meant to be seen. The church exists to be a living example,

220
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,680
 though it's flawed, though it has issues, though it struggles,

221
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,280
 yet it's full of hope and grace of the reconciliation that has happened

222
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,880
 for humanity between God and with itself.

223
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,680
 This is Christ's church. This is his bride. It's countercultural, it's different,

224
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,880
 it's wild, and it ends up becoming a bit of a spark of light in a dark space

225
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,880
 because it's such a meaningful purpose. It creates something so different

226
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,480
 than what the world has seen. And it's for that reason that we cannot afford

227
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,080
 to minimize church to just a 90 minutes on a Sunday once a week.

228
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,280
 It's for this reason that we have to see church as what happens outside of this building as well.

229
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,080
 We can't just attend service. We can't just reduce church to a location,

230
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,480
 to a building. But it's actually the beautiful, fulfilled destiny of God's people

231
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,080
 coming together, living in relationship, reconciled with one another,

232
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,480
 gathered in common unity. It's why we have this concept of the river model

233
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,680
 here at Divine. It's that the church is not, we're not trying to build

234
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,880
 a really big building. I think the original vision statement was that

235
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,880
 God doesn't want us to build a really big church. He doesn't want 5,000 people

236
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,280
 coming here per se. But rather, imagine if those people were going there.

237
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,880
 Because each one of you carry the heart and the DNA of Christ with you

238
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,880
 if you believe in Jesus. And so how impactful can you be displaying who God is

239
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,480
 in the places that you go? Whether it's in the space of law, or education,

240
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,480
 or finance, you can carry Jesus there. Right? This place is already light.

241
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,080
 I've heard a silly example. You don't shine light where it's light.

242
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,080
 It has no real impact there. But take light to the darkness.

243
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,080
 Take light outside of the church, and you will really be able to see

244
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,480
 its impact there. This is why we have the river model, bringing evidence

245
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,680
 to the world of this new humanity that God has created, that is reconciled

246
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:59,280
 with each other. So you know what that means, right? That means for us to be

247
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,780
 this kind of humanity, we have to be in relationship with one another.

248
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,880
 It means we have to be in community. It means we have to see each other.

249
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,680
 It means we have to live all that nice fluffy stuff that community does,

250
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,680
 you know? Like it cares for one another, it prays for one another,

251
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,780
 it bears one another's burdens. It's pretty hard to bear the burdens

252
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,380
 of 600 people once a week for 90 minutes on a Sunday. Right?

253
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,980
 We've got to be able to take the responsibilities, the natural outworking

254
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,980
 of the church can only be expressed outside of here. And that's what God

255
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,380
 is calling us to do. That's how he's designed the church to be.

256
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,780
 More than a service, but a reconciled people living that reconciled relationship

257
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,880
 as an evidence to the world, as a living example. And it's cool because it's just

258
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,380
 by the mere fact that we can be from different backgrounds, we can have

259
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,780
 different preferences and different understandings of things.

260
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,680
 We can come with different customs, we can have a different hierarchy

261
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:02,980
 of values. Yet, this singular Jesus as our unifying factor can be so important

262
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,980
 that it can hold the highest importance to us. That it doesn't matter what we have

263
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,480
 different about us, it won't splinter us. We're held together by the unity found

264
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,180
 in Christ Jesus. Now, that's different, guys. That's not common.

265
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,380
 That's not what you normally would get. I think the idea that God has of bringing

266
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,780
 all people together with opposing backgrounds and unifying them is a little

267
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:32,680
 intense, especially in our 2024 society where it's so challenging to get people

268
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,580
 to agree or even like each other. Most people I know don't even talk to one

269
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,680
 another. I think there's a natural tension that we all live within our current culture.

270
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,080
 Our culture has this hyper-focus on perpetually creating distinctions that

271
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,180
 separate me from you, categorizing me as this, therefore I'm not you,

272
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,980
 creating a bit of a separation or a barrier. Society is not united,

273
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,380
 it's society siloed when identities bring no harmony to one another.

274
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,780
 Views and perspectives only separate and polarize. When reactive ideologies,

275
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,480
 rather than unifying people, they unify groups of people against other people.

276
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,180
 This is the norm. This is the world we live within. Extreme ways of thinking kind

277
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,980
 of flood our spaces where there's no middle ground, no room for conversation.

278
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,780
 Either you 100% agree with me or you hate me and you're a bigot and everything

279
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,880
 is terrible. That's kind of the social way of dealing with one another.

280
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 This experiment isn't supposed to work when this is the norm.

281
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,780
 This weird concept of bringing people together who are unified, who love each

282
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,680
 other, who are not just at peace but they are working together, this new humanity,

283
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,080
 it's impossible. It seems so impossible. It seems like a weird hippie euphoria that

284
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,380
 just cannot be achieved. But in reality, man, this is exactly what Christ is setting up.

285
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,880
 This is what Christ has set up his church to be. A different kind of community,

286
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,880
 a new humanity. I think the phrase we used in the past was an alternative society,

287
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,380
 a people where there's no special privilege because of your status.

288
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,680
 There's no disadvantage because of your work or your education level.

289
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,780
 Your race doesn't make a difference. Your background doesn't make a difference.

290
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,880
 Your culture doesn't make a difference. We love you regardless and we treat you

291
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,080
 equally and fair. And when God's church becomes this place, it actually naturally

292
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,880
 becomes a birthplace of so many liberties and so much justice and so much care,

293
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,980
 the church then becomes a place where freedoms are born, where people care

294
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,880
 for one another, where the community speaks up about the need of each other

295
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,280
 because everyone's valuable, everyone's equal, everyone has the imago dei

296
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,680
 within them, right? So then it doesn't matter the widow and the orphan,

297
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,380
 we're going to take care of them. If you don't have need, we're going to meet your need.

298
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,580
 That's the kind of community...this is what the church is supposed to be,

299
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,280
 the place of equality and freedom and liberty and care and all these values

300
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,680
 that we see. The birthplace of it is within this reconciled humanity.

301
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:04,880
 This is all God's initial idea. See, when the church lives this way,

302
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,080
 when the church lives out these things, it displays the wisdom of God,

303
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,180
 the ways of God, the things of God. It shows it to the world and it lives

304
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,180
 as a reconciled community together. It's that concept of your kingdom come,

305
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,480
 it happens through the church living together, reconciled in relationship.

306
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,780
 Last week, when Pastor Allison preached, he had a quote towards the middle/tail end

307
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:37,280
 of his sermon that had me thinking all week. It was this quote and it said this,

308
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,680
 "The church is not meant to reflect culture." The church is not meant

309
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,680
 to reflect culture. It had me kind of really chewing on that this week,

310
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,480
 thinking about, "Okay, that is so good. Why is that so good?"

311
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,480
 I think the problem is that so often when we're not careful, the community of God

312
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,280
 can look like everyone else. The church is not meant to reflect culture.

313
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,080
 No, the church has a more grand and intentional purpose.

314
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,380
 The church is God's wisdom on display. According to this passage,

315
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,380
 we exist to display something. And the thing that we are meant to display

316
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:17,180
 in this humanity reconciled with one another is actually the wisdom of God.

317
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,880
 And this isn't just a new idea that Paul introduces here in Ephesians 3.10.

318
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,980
 It's actually a constant theme throughout the scriptures. You would see in Matthew

319
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,080
 when Jesus would preach to the people, he would say things like,

320
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,480
 "You are a city on a hill." And why do you put a city on a hill?

321
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,880
 So that it can be seen, so they can illuminate what's there, right?

322
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,880
 "You don't light a lamp and hide it." Right? So I grew up kind of Baptist.

323
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,580
 We used to sing a song in church that this little light of mine,

324
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,280
 I'm going to let it shine. You guys know that song?

325
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,480
 Did that make it all the way to Hong Kong? All right, cool, cool.

326
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,880
 Just making sure. It was a pretty hit song back in the day.

327
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,080
 But you don't light a lamp and then you hide it. This makes no sense.

328
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,480
 If you light something, light is meant to be seen. It's meant to be displayed.

329
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,080
 It serves a purpose when it's seen. And we as a church, we are like that.

330
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,780
 We are God's wisdom. We are that lamp of God's wisdom shining,

331
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,380
 displaying who he is. We are salt of the earth or yeast in dough,

332
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,280
 displayed to be seen. And it's really cool because I think a lot of times

333
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,580
 we think about how can we be more evangelistic as a church?

334
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,080
 People feel like it's so hard to evangelize, go and talk to someone about Jesus.

335
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,180
 That can be a little awkward to just say, "Hey, do you know about Jesus?

336
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,380
 Have you met Jesus yet?" No one really wants to do that.

337
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,180
 But did you know there's actually an easier way to evangelize?

338
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,580
 See, when the church lives this, when light shines in darkness and it's seen,

339
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,980
 it attracts. People see this community that lives different,

340
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,980
 a community that doesn't hate each other because they have different views,

341
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,280
 a community that will talk to one another and will reconcile their issues,

342
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,380
 a community that loves each other, that treats people equally.

343
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,280
 It doesn't matter what status you are, what education you are, what race you are,

344
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,380
 what ethnicity you are, you're welcomed and loved. You're fairly fought for.

345
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,980
 Those who are disadvantaged in this community get hope and help.

346
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,780
 If I have needs, the community will take care of me.

347
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,180
 That kind of community doesn't exist outside the church.

348
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:14,680
 That community exists to be seen, right? So when that happens in our society,

349
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,880
 it naturally will draw, it'll catch people's attention because it's so different than

350
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,680
 what else we see out in the world. It becomes an evangelistic tool just in itself.

351
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:30,180
 People are drawn by the unity and the love and the joy, frankly, the Jesus that we share.

352
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,280
 And so in that space, we don't invite them to church, we invite them to Jesus,

353
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:40,380
 where their vertical reconciliation with God leads them to a horizontal reconciliation

354
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,980
 with one another. Jesus would say this, we're asked,

355
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,680
 "What is the most important law in all of Scripture?"

356
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,180
 By the religious leaders who were testing him to see what he'd say,

357
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,980
 "What's the most important law in all of Scripture?"

358
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,280
 Jesus would reply to a question that has seemingly one answer by giving two answers.

359
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,780
 The most important thing in all of Scripture, Scripture says,

360
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,380
 "One thing, if I can summarize everything together, it'd be this,

361
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,680
 love God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength."

362
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,180
 They got that, they were good with that one. They had that one memorized,

363
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,380
 they'd written it places. And then he said, "And," meaning there's more,

364
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:18,280
 "love God and love your neighbor as yourself." Right? John would tell us that

365
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:25,480
 if you can't love your brother who you can physically see, how then is it possible

366
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,780
 for you to love God who you cannot see? It seems like these two things cannot

367
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,580
 be separated. A love for God must lead to a love for one another.

368
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,480
 God reconciled us to him so that we can be reconciled together.

369
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,080
 And that kind of church, living that out will be seen. Jesus designed it to be seen,

370
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,880
 and designed it to be displayed. When church is done right,

371
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,580
 the church will be noticed. And this is his method. His method is great

372
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,580
 because it's not about a church that says the most, you know, radical things,

373
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,380
 or that lives on the edge, or a church that's hyper-creative,

374
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,080
 or a church that has cool lights, or a church that makes big statements.

375
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,580
 Actually, the way you're noticed as God's wisdom displayed to the world is simple.

376
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,480
 I'll give you another verse that tells it to us more plainly.

377
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,780
 Jesus says in John 13, "They will know that you are my disciples,

378
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:21,080
 that you belong to me by your love for one another." Again, this idea of how we live

379
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:29,380
 in relationship with each other, reconciling humanity.

380
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:37,380
 Recognize, by the way, we treat each other. To display the church,

381
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,880
 the church needs to be seen. And so I think when we live this reconciliation out,

382
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,380
 the church will be seen to the world. But I find this passage interesting

383
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,780
 because I think that's kind of the natural understanding of what it's saying, right?

384
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,880
 That if we live in this way, then others will see it, display to be seen.

385
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:02,680
 But what Paul actually focuses on here isn't just about us being seen physically.

386
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,280
 His words are about the spiritual world. Let me read you one more time

387
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,480
 and see if you caught on to it in Ephesians 3, verse 10.

388
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,580
 His intent was that now, through the church, through us, the manifold wisdom,

389
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:21,080
 that just means the multifaceted, vast wisdom of God, would be on display,

390
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:28,180
 be seen, should be made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms.

391
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,580
 Here's a key word there, in the heavenly realms. Rulers in the heavenly,

392
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,080
 in the spiritual. This is truly wild. See, God's plan all this time was for us

393
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,980
 to reveal him, but not just to humanity, to the rest of creation.

394
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,980
 Did you know that you living in reconciled relationship with your neighbor

395
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,980
 says something to the spiritual world? I think sometimes we put that on the back burner.

396
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,080
 We don't talk about it a lot. It's pretty challenging to talk about the things

397
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,880
 that you can't see. I get it. But let me lay it out for us this way.

398
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,780
 Paul would say this in Ephesians 6, 12. I think we all know, or some of us are familiar

399
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,980
 with the armor of God concept, right? You know, the helmet of salvation,

400
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,380
 the breastplate of righteousness, all these things.

401
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:16,880
 So before he says that in chapter 6, he says this, "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,

402
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,980
 but against rulers," similar word, "against the authorities," similar words,

403
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:27,080
 "against the powers of this dark age and against the spiritual forces of evil in the," what?

404
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,980
 "Heavenly realms." There is a spiritual battle that wages.

405
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:39,280
 He is speaking of the spiritual world. The church is important.

406
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,780
 The church living the way it's meant to be is not just for reconciliation for our sake,

407
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:52,080
 but it's unorthodoxically God's way, His method of displaying His wisdom as superior to everything

408
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,880
 in all of creation. He is intent on displaying through you and myself.

409
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,280
 We serve such a big purpose as the church. So it can't just be about, okay,

410
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,580
 let me get back to my point. Satan and his demons are pushed back.

411
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:15,980
 They are halted in their steps, not because you're preaching tongues or get crazy,

412
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,880
 because you can live in reconciled relationship with one another.

413
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,380
 I feel like he's made it somewhat easy for us. Learn to love your neighbor,

414
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:31,580
 and the impact of that within the church is a reconciled new people that brings us so much good.

415
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:37,680
 Christ's church, by being His church, declares a wise God to the spiritual world.

416
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,980
 Another way to put it is this. A scholar said it this way, so I'm going to quote him.

417
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:49,480
 He says, "God creating the church on purpose as His scheme for a reconciled universe

418
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,880
 delivers a defeating blow to the enemy, displaying God as wise and right,

419
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,680
 showing that His ways are not only higher, but they are better."

420
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,780
 So we, His church, end up being a physical statement to the spiritual realm

421
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:13,980
 that God is good, that He's redeemed humanity, and He's redeeming creation.

422
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,980
 So let me sum up all these 13 verses and all these concepts of manifold wisdom

423
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,580
 and the spiritual realm on display, because it's quite a lot to say.

424
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:29,380
 The reconciliation of humanity to God, so our vertical relationship,

425
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:37,280
 and to one another, our horizontal relationships, displayed through the church

426
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,580
 is meant to reveal the manifold wisdom of God to the rulers of this world

427
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,380
 and to the spiritual world. The church matters. The church is important.

428
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,580
 The church has a purpose. The church has a job.

429
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,680
 It's significant to the physical world and to the spiritual world.

430
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,580
 God chose to use you and myself in making that statement.

431
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,480
 So the Vine church, the Vine community, as the church, has to be a people

432
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,280
 who love one another, who live that out, not just when we gather.

433
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,580
 It can be easy to say hi quickly, and then that's it.

434
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,480
 But I'm going to challenge you. What about Monday through Saturday?

435
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,380
 How can we live out this humanity reconciled in that space?

436
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,880
 See, I think a community of people who care about this city

437
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,680
 and get involved in maybe the justice work of Hong Kong

438
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,580
 is one way that we can live this out.

439
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,280
 Maybe it could be as simple as hosting a community group,

440
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,880
 allowing people to gather at some point throughout the week

441
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,080
 for a chance of spiritual nourishment, for a chance of opportunity to love each other.

442
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,280
 We actually got a great display of community this morning

443
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,980
 when we had five families that are meeting on Fridays every other week

444
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,080
 or something like that, all the way in Taipo.

445
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,680
 That's really far, guys.

446
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,380
 But that's the reconciliation of humanity, man.

447
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,280
 That's an effort, right? And we can be like that.

448
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,480
 Maybe it's hosting it there.

449
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,580
 Maybe you work a ridiculously busy job and you don't have a lot of time.

450
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,880
 There's opportunities where perhaps during your lunch hour,

451
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,180
 maybe humanity reconciled to one another is you creating space

452
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,880
 for people in your industry just to talk, just to get together,

453
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,680
 a space where maybe you can pray together.

454
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,180
 Maybe you can, if you're all Christians, could you encourage each other in your faith?

455
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,480
 And this allows the church not just to be a building,

456
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,080
 but it allows the church to be a river, something that we can send out,

457
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,180
 a community who might pray for one another and the needs that they might have.

458
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:37,980
 This is the wisdom of God displayed to the world and to the spiritual realm.

459
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,480
 So I think there's a couple of questions that we have to ask ourselves.

460
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,780
 I want to land on this.

461
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,080
 There's a couple of questions we have to ask ourselves that are two-folded

462
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,780
 that will help us, I genuinely feel, wrestle with and allow God

463
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,780
 that when we submit to him to lead us forward in deeper reconciliation with one another.

464
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,580
 The first question is similar to what Pastor Ellison preached last week.

465
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:02,480
 Again, Ephesians 2, Ephesians 3, at least the first 10 verses are very, very similar.

466
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,580
 So I'm going to ask you to get almost the exact same question.

467
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,680
 Here it is. Have we allowed the gospel to change us so fully

468
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,080
 that we can love whoever walks through the doors of our community?

469
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,480
 Take a minute. Have we allowed the gospel to change us so fully

470
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,680
 that we can love whoever walks through these doors and into our community?

471
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,180
 That's a really big part of what this reconciliation is all about.

472
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,780
 It's not in your own strength that you can just love people

473
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,780
 because people can be frustrating most days.

474
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,380
 You can't just try harder. But actually, we can love because he first loved us.

475
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,180
 We've experienced love. We've had love exemplified for us.

476
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:48,880
 And from that, we can find ways to love those around us.

477
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,480
 And making sure that we don't allow silly things to create barriers between us.

478
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,580
 Right? Like that's one way that humanity can be reconciled together

479
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:04,780
 and displayed through the church, displaying the manifold wisdom of God.

480
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:10,880
 So I think it's worth asking ourselves, what are those things that might hinder us?

481
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,180
 What are those things that make it difficult?

482
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,180
 What are those things that make it slightly uncomfortable to love those around us?

483
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,080
 What's stopping you?

484
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,980
 Maybe that's something you ask God throughout this week

485
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,080
 and ask him to show it to you, to illuminate it to you.

486
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,180
 And you ask him to give you the strength to lay it down and submit it to Jesus

487
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,180
 because that's all we can do with that.

488
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,980
 The second point I want to ask us to think around.

489
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,880
 How can we be a river? The church as a living example throughout the city.

490
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,480
 Again, not the church as a building, but the church as a people.

491
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,780
 How can we go out and water the lands of Hong Kong?

492
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,180
 How can Jesus not just be sung about here on a Sunday,

493
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:53,280
 but we take him with us into whatever sphere of influence we might work or live or reside in?

494
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,780
 Do we dare to allow the unifying power of Christ to give us the courage to speak to those

495
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,180
 who might be different than us?

496
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,680
 What about do we dare to allow the unifying power of Christ bringing a new humanity

497
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,680
 to impact the way that we're generous?

498
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,580
 Our generosity to the needs around us, not just in this specific community,

499
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,980
 not just the small case C for church.

500
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,780
 I'm talking about the church, the wider group of Christians.

501
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,980
 How can we allow what God is doing to impact our generosity?

502
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,880
 I talked with someone today and they were sharing how this message made them think about forgiveness.

503
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,380
 And they shared an example of how there's someone in their office

504
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,280
 that they were really struggling with.

505
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,180
 And it made me think, okay, well, what does the reconciliation of humanity

506
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,780
 to one another look like in our offices?

507
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:44,080
 Perhaps there's a colleague that just isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.

508
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,280
 Someone that's really frustrating you.

509
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,580
 Someone that you just can't...how can you allow, could you submit that to Christ

510
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:57,080
 and ask him to give you the compassion of Jesus, give you the eyes that Jesus had

511
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:02,080
 when he looked at all of us and saw the image of God within us to be in your workplace?

512
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,180
 I thought about this last Sunday. I ran to grab coffee.

513
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,380
 I want to share this because I feel like I'm supposed to share it.

514
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:16,680
 I was walking back from Long Chai Road and I saw someone who's a former colleague from Levine.

515
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,880
 That colleague and I didn't get along very well.

516
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,080
 But they no longer work here for whatever reason.

517
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,980
 And I immediately was like...I have to confess.

518
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,480
 I immediately kind of hid, felt like Adam for a bit.

519
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,080
 I kind of like wanted them to go past so that we didn't see each other,

520
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,880
 so we didn't have that awkward encounter, right?

521
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,280
 Because you have to say, "Hey, how are you doing?" but not really mean it.

522
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,980
 And as soon as I did it, as soon as I did it, I felt convicted in my step.

523
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,180
 I felt like God was like, "How are you going to preach about reconciliation

524
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,980
 if you can't forgive someone for something from three years ago?"

525
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,680
 Right? Like, it's a message for me too.

526
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,880
 So again, this stuff is super practical because it is just in the day-to-day.

527
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,680
 It is in the Monday through Saturday.

528
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,780
 The way that you treat your neighbor, the way that you are slow to anger and quick to forgive,

529
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:03,080
 listening and caring, living out compassionately, forgiving 70 times 7,

530
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,480
 like Christ forgave us.

531
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,180
 These are all practical ways that you and myself can live out humanity,

532
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:16,280
 reconciled, yes, with God, but also what displays the wisdom of God is that humanity

533
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,880
 reconciled with one another.

534
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,280
 I believe that's Pastor Andrew's heart for this community.

535
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,380
 I believe that's what our elders dream of when they think of us as a church,

536
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:31,780
 a church that is not known for anything other than we are displaying God's wisdom.

537
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,780
 I want us to be that people.

538
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,080
 I think we can be.

539
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:48,580
 So as the band comes up, I'm going to invite everyone to stand.

540
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:56,880
 And perhaps for you this morning, hearing all of this is very informative,

541
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,980
 but you're asking, "God, what does that look like for me?

542
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,580
 What does it all boil down to, Jesus?"

543
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:10,380
 I believe God wants to do a work of deepening our reconciliation with one another.

544
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,580
 I believe that He cares about the way we treat each other.

545
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:18,280
 I believe that's at the center of His heart, that we've been changed by Him to love each

546
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,580
 other as well.

547
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,180
 And so whether you're here and you feel like I've got that knocked out of the park,

548
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:29,480
 or whether you're here and you're like, "I have quite a few people on my do not like list."

549
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,680
 Yeah, I just pray that the Holy Spirit will open our eyes, will start to speak to us now

550
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,280
 about what it could look like this week, wherever you are, and whatever you're called

551
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:46,580
 to do, wherever location that is, even if it's a typo, to bring God's wisdom,

552
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,580
 to bring God with you where you go.

553
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:57,080
 So, Jesus, we ask you this morning for your Holy Spirit to lead and to guide,

554
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:02,380
 that you would illuminate what it means to love our neighbor.

555
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:07,680
 God, that we will live in response to the love that we've received from you.

556
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,980
 God, that that would guide and inform and motivate the way that we engage with those

557
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,380
 who are around us who might be easy to get along with, and those who are around us

558
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,080
 who are a little trickier.

559
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,380
 God, I pray for divine patience.

560
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:28,880
 I pray for a change in our perspective, that we would recognize that what we do

561
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,780
 day-to-day matters because it shows something to the world of who you are.

562
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,080
 God, make us obsessed.

563
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,880
 God, make us obsessed with displaying you and only you.

564
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,280
 God, we ask for unity in this community.

565
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,980
 We ask that you would unite us around you.

566
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,480
 I pray that you would be above everything, that you would be that unifying factor

567
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,080
 for the divine community, for both those who are here physically and those

568
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,780
 who are online.

569
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,280
 God, that you would show us what it looks like to really dig in to who you are,

570
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,280
 to draw our strength from you.

571
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,880
 God, I pray that you would continue through the work of your Holy Spirit to deepen

572
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,080
 the reconciliation that is between man and God, and give us the strength

573
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,680
 and the courage to live out that reconciliation with our neighbor,

574
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,580
 displaying you as a wise God, as a good God, as a God who is victorious,

575
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,080
 as a God who knows what he's doing to both the physical world

576
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,880
 and to the spiritual world.

577
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,780
 Jesus' name.
