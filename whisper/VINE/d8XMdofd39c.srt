00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Church, I'm very excited that we get to have Pastor Ellison with us today.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Hello, Ellison.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Hi, Carla.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 It is so good that you are here.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 I'm glad to be here.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 I wonder, can we pray for you?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Yes, please. I think I need that.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Do you want to pray for him? Yeah? Yeah?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Yes.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 I think they do.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Okay, great.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Father, we thank you for Ellison and we thank you for the Word that you have given him.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And I pray, Father, that our hearts would be ready to receive.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Soften our hearts.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Let us be open to your Spirit at work in us.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And I pray for Ellison.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 May you anoint him, the words that he speaks, not from himself, but from you.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 In Jesus' name.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Amen.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Amen.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Thank you, Carla.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Thank you, team.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And good morning, Church.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Welcome.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 So glad to be with you guys this morning.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So, when I was a young boy, when I was a kid, my mom worked around the central area.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And so quite often she would have me meet her during lunchtime or after work or something like that.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 The only problem is I didn't like meeting her near her work.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And the reason was because it was quite scary.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 See, she would always ask me to meet her behind the area in St. John's Cathedral.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And it was scary for a couple of reasons.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Partly because, you know, that cathedral as a young kid, sometimes it's quite dark there, right?

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 So it looks kind of scary.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 There's also a grave site there, which made it a bit scary.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 But the one thing that I was most scared of was that quite often, hanging out in that area, there would be two old ladies.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 They looked like twin sisters.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And they would hang out there a lot of the time.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Now, I wasn't scared of them because they were old.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 But what I found quite scary at that point was that they looked quite disheveled, almost homeless.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 But the really, really scary thing was every time I would walk past them, they would just look at me, glare at me, not in a friendly way.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 In this really sort of scary eyes, they would look at me.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And as I would walk past or as I would be waiting for my mum, they would just stare at me.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And they were muttering things under their breath.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 You couldn't quite make out what they were saying.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And so, you know, I talked to my friends about some of this.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Have you ever seen those two ladies?

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And that's when the rumors really started flying, right?

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 They were like, "Oh, yeah, you know, those two ladies, they are homeless witches.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 They are possessed by the devil.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And they used to be rich, but someone put a curse on them.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And so now they're poor and homeless.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And because they're witches, they try to abduct little children and do the same thing to them."

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Now, of course, as a young, naive, gullible kid, I believed every word these people said to me.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And the thing that furthered the intrigue was that they were white ladies.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 They were foreigners.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 They were westerners, which was--and they looked disheveled and homeless, which was not a usual sight in Hong Kong.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And so in my wild, childish little imagination, I had it in my head that these ladies really were witches.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And if I hung around them too long, if I got too close to them or something like that,

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 they would turn me into lizards and I would never see my mum again or something like that.

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 They would cast a spell on me.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 But the truth is, actually, I don't really know what the situation for these two ladies was.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 They were obviously two people--now I think back about it--that were distressed and in need of help and support.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And I also think it's fair to say that, you know, this wasn't the life these ladies had planned to live.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I'm sure at one point they had thriving lives, lives that were full and full of fun and family and all that good stuff.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 But something must have happened along the way,

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 which meant that at this moment they weren't able to appreciate life as much as they used to.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 We're continuing our series on post-traumatic growth today, and we're talking about appreciation of life.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And the passage that we're looking at today is a bit like what I experienced as a kid,

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 only probably like a thousand times more intense, okay?

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And as we unpack this passage, we're going to be reading about a man who was literally possessed by demons.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And as a result, he too didn't have very much to look forward to or appreciate about life.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 But as we're about to discover, church, a true encounter with Jesus turns that around.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And so if you're following on with your Bibles or your apps or something, if you want to put it on the screen,

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 you can close down Facebook for a second, pull up the Bible app, okay?

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Mark chapter 5 is where we're at, okay? And that's where we're going to be reading from today.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 So read along with me, all right? Here we go. Mark chapter 5.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 "They went across the lake to the region of Gerasimus.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 This man lived in the tombs and no one could bind him, not even with a chain,

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 for he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 No one was strong enough to subdue him.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Night and day among the tombs and in the hills, he would cry out and cut himself with stones."

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Now, before we get into this passage, let me give you a little bit of some background, okay?

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 In chapter 5 of the book of Mark, it tells us that the disciples had just crossed the lake to reach this destination.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 But along the way on the lake, they encountered a really fierce storm.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 A storm so fierce that Jesus and his disciples, the disciples especially, were all scared.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Now, the Sea of Galilee is quite famous for its sudden storms, very stormy conditions.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And Jesus and his disciples find themselves in the middle of one of these storms.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 A storm so big that, like I said, seasoned fishermen even find themselves scared in it, feared for their safety.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 And you also have to understand one thing, that the sea for the Jewish people carried with it this sense of evil and darkness.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 This is where scary things came from. This was the place where monsters came from.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 The sea was a dark and scary, evil place.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Now, I'm not sure if many of you have been in a stormy boat.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I have been on the Star Ferry on a T3, okay?

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And it's not quite the same, okay, but that's the closest I've been.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 But even that was scary enough.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 People flying about in the sea, you know, pumping sliced lattes being spilled all over the place.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 You know, people screaming and shouting.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 This was probably like a million times worse than that.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 But in the middle of this storm, it tells us that Jesus was chilled.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 He's relaxed. He's asleep even.

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And his disciples wake him up screaming, "What? We're about to die, Jesus. Don't you care we're about to die?"

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And they think they're about to be swallowed up and drowned by this big evil sea.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Now, Jesus wakes up and with a short phrase, he just says, "Quiet! Be still!"

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And everything is calmed.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I always find that amazing as a kid, you know.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Have you ever, as a kid, stepped out in a storm and said, "Quiet! Be still!"

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And nothing ever happens, right?

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Those words never work.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Especially if you're having an argument with your spouse.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Never say, "Calm down," okay?

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Because it just doesn't work.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Never, ever, ever works.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 But it does for Jesus.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 He rebukes the sea and it calms down.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And afterwards, he turns and he sort of rebukes his disciples at the same time.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 He says to them, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And it says that his disciples reacted in fear.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 They were terrified.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And I'm paraphrasing a little bit here, but they turn and say to each other, "Who is this guy?"

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 "What power does he have? Even the wind and the seas obey him. Who does that?"

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 You know, Church, I don't think we'd be far off wrong if we likened our past 20 months or so

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 to being on a boat with Jesus, tossed around in the sea.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Sure, Jesus has been with us, right?

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 But at times, hasn't it feel like that he's been asleep?

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 How many times have we cried out individually and as a community, calling out to him, saying those exact words?

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 "Jesus, don't you care what happens to this city?"

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 "Don't you see the things that this church, your people are going through?"

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And we've been desperate for Jesus just to come and say a word and to calm everything

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 and to make these big, scary things disappear.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And in the waiting for things to get better, it often feels like we lose a little bit of how to appreciate life at this moment, doesn't it?

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 We were also looking forward to saying goodbye to 2020 and welcoming 2021

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 to bring some peace and stability into our lives.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 But it seems as though we've just been thrust into another storm, right?

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 It seems like COVID is still all over the place and death rates are still rising in a lot of countries,

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 even as vaccines are being rolled out.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 In the US, recently, we saw some very disturbing political scenes unraveling.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 In our own city, political tensions remain high.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Frustration over confusing COVID lockdowns and restrictions and all this kind of stuff.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 We barely caught our breath out of 2020 and now 2021, we're facing storm after storm after storm.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And the same thing is happening to the disciples.

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 They get to the other side of the lake and just like the waves that rush towards the boat,

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 a demon-possessed man comes rushing towards Jesus and the disciples.

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And this man has been tossed and turned by the evil spirits he's been tormented with for some time now.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 But Jesus, after calming the sea, is about to calm the storm in this man's life too.

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And now, before we go any further, I just want to acknowledge something here, okay?

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And this is it, church.

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Spiritual warfare is a real thing.

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Alright, yes, I know we live in a messed up and broken world

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 and a lot of the things that come our way is because of our own stupidity and foolishness and our own sin.

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Okay, there's consequences and we have to take responsibility for those things.

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 But at the same time, there's also a very real enemy, Satan and his minions,

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 these demons that are actively trying to disrupt you and harm you in any number of ways.

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 We're not going to go into too much detail about this, only to say two things, right?

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Demons can either affect us by oppression or possession.

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Now, as Christians, if you're a Christian listening to this,

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 if you receive the Holy Spirit into your life, we don't need to worry about possession.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I don't believe that Satan and his demons can possess a Christian.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 But he can certainly use things to try and harm you and to oppress you.

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 However, what Mark describes clearly here is someone who's been possessed by demons.

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 We know this because he goes into some pretty graphic details about the state of this man.

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 It tells us that he lived in the tombs, he had some sort of supernatural strength

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 and not even the chains could hold him down.

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And I'm not talking about the good charismatic way that we sing about in church sometimes.

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 These were literal chains that people tried to put on him and he broke them off.

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 He would cry out at night like a wild animal.

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 His body was covered in wounds and scars because he had used stones to cut and hurt himself.

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 It's almost like Mark is not describing a man here, but more like some kind of monster or an animal.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Even the word Mark uses to describe him, the way people would treat him, it says here "subdue"

170
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 but a more direct translation of that word would be "to tame."

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 You don't tame human beings, you tame wild animals.

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 And the community had outcast him.

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 The community that he had once been a part of had thrown him out there into the night.

174
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 They cast him up, they tried to chain him up, tie him down, abandoning him to the outskirts of town.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 As I was reading this passage in Mark 5, I often wondered to myself,

176
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I wonder if that's what those two old ladies felt like sometimes.

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Sure, they looked a bit scary, maybe they even acted a bit scary.

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And it was clear that there's not just me, other people were afraid to approach them too.

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 But did the community around them ever really truly try to reach out to them or help them?

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Or did they just give up on them, abandoning them to the outskirts of society?

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Or maybe perhaps you listening right now are relating on a personal level.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 As Pastor Andrew said at the beginning of this series,

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 like this man, perhaps you found yourself outcast and abandoned, cut by stones.

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 You have these wounds and scars that you're not too sure what to do about.

185
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And in talking about post-traumatic growth and this appreciation for life,

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 we have to realize that this isn't something we can do our own.

187
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 This is a call we've been saying time and time again.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 We can't do this by ourselves, but rather we need each other to help us move forward

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 from mourning to healing and into a space of thriving again.

190
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 You ask anyone who's walked through some stuff in their lives,

191
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 and they will tell you that they probably didn't do it alone.

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I can almost guarantee you that there was people surrounding them,

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 journeying with them through that place.

194
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Vine Church, are we the kind of community that says to these kind of people,

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 "Stay with us. We love you. We welcome you. We're not scared of you.

196
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 We want to walk through the pain with you."

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Or are we going to be the kind of community that says,

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 "You know what? Out of sight, out of mind. We can't reach those people anyway.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 They can go out there and scream and do whatever they want to do,

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 and we'll just carry on our lives as normal."

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 The community had given up on this man, but Jesus wasn't about to do that.

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 We carry on reading. Verse 6, it says this,

203
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 "When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran, fell on his knees in front of him.

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 He shouted at the top of his voice, 'What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God?

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 In God's name, don't torture me.'

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 For Jesus had said to him, 'Come out of this man, you evil spirit.'"

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 This man possessed by the evil spirits rushes towards Jesus,

208
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 and he knows exactly who Jesus is.

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 He knows his name, he knows his identity, and he knows his power.

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 But even though he knows who Jesus is, he really doesn't want anything to do with him.

211
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Now this is all happening in the context of a demon-possessed man, of course,

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 but if we look at our own lives, do we ever react in the same way, perhaps?

213
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 A lot of us will know, will say we know at least, who Jesus is.

214
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 A lot of us, we say, we acknowledge his power, we know his name.

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 But many times, for whatever reasons, we might truly fail to worship him.

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And when I say worship here, I don't just mean singing along with the beautiful worship team.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I don't even mean just reading a Bible, or even spending time in prayer.

218
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 True worship is letting God invade every single part of your life.

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Every single part of your life.

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And I know that in my own life, it's often hard to take control of that.

221
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I want autonomy, I want to make my own decisions,

222
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 I don't want God's opinion in how to use my finances, my time, my energies.

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Sometimes, to me, obedience feels more like resentment.

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And perhaps, one of the reasons we lose the appreciation of life,

225
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 when it gets stormy, is because we tend to lose the appreciation of the giver of life.

226
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 We stop Jesus from working in us.

227
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 We stop being thankful, we put up all these barriers to the Lord,

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 and then we suddenly start to think to ourselves,

229
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 where's all the hope gone? Where's all the joy gone?

230
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 This demon-possessed man clearly has many things, many barriers,

231
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 that are stopping him from truly connecting with Jesus.

232
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And Jesus sees his pain, and he reaches out to him.

233
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And of course, this is very typical of the way Jesus lived his life.

234
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Where others would point and stare and stay away, Jesus invites in.

235
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Jesus reaches out to these outcasts, the lepers, the sinners, prostitutes, tax selectors, demon-possessed people.

236
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Jesus reaches out to them, and each time Jesus reaches out to these people in love and healing,

237
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 he does so without condition.

238
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 This is an important thing for us to remember.

239
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Notice that Jesus doesn't first of all question this man before casting out these demons.

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 He doesn't give him a lecture, "Tus, tus, tus, you naughty boy, you know you shouldn't have done that.

241
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 This is why you ended up like this in the first place."

242
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 He doesn't force him to repent from his sins before he heals.

243
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 He simply heals.

244
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 He sees a distorted image of God.

245
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 A human being made in God's image has been completely distorted right now,

246
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 and he reaches out in love.

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 This is another important thing for those of us who might be walking alongside people in post-traumatic growth.

248
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Often it's tempting, isn't it, to play the role of judge before we move on to helping.

249
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 We might even do this subconsciously.

250
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 We blame the victim instead of addressing the source of the pain.

251
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 But a person who truly appreciates the beauty of life that Jesus wants us to have

252
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 will also help others do the same.

253
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And when we blame the victim, it does the opposite of this.

254
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 What Jesus realizes is that this was a man being tormented by these demons.

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 It didn't matter to Jesus how he got into this state.

256
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 All he sees is someone who needs help, and he reaches out.

257
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 And our challenge is this, church, are we willing to do the same?

258
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Are we willing to reach into the places where evil is in the name of Jesus

259
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 and rescue these people out of the darkness by his power, by his grace?

260
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 It tells us very specifically as we read on,

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 the source for this man's pain was the fact, like we said, he's been possessed by many demons.

262
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 In fact, this demon has a name.

263
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 It says, "Legion." Mark tells us this, okay?

264
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Verse 9, "Then Jesus asked him, 'What is your name?'

265
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 'My name is Legion,' he replied, 'for we are many.'

266
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area."

267
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Here's an interesting thing I found about this.

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 You know, often when we go through trauma, right?

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 When we go through trauma, it's not always as simple as just one thing.

270
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Legion means many things.

271
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And for example, if we walk alongside people with depression,

272
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 depression isn't just simple as feeling low, right?

273
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 It carries with it things like anxiety, lack of sleep, lack of appetite, risky behavior, mood swings, those kind of things.

274
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Or if you look at someone walking through grief,

275
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 grief is this journey where there's ups and downs, there's twists and turns we don't see.

276
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 It's a long, thorny, and winding road.

277
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And so as we look at our own trauma and the trauma of those around us,

278
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 we must be careful sometimes not to oversimplify things.

279
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 We must be patient with ourselves and the people that we're walking alongside.

280
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 But there's also a bigger picture here I think the scripture wants us to capture as well.

281
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 When the name Legion was mentioned,

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 it would have immediately struck a chord with the original readers of the book of Mark.

283
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And what we have to remember is at this time, Roman soldiers overran the territory.

284
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Legion was used to describe 6,000 soldiers.

285
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And these soldiers would go around inflicting pain on people, overtaking everything they wanted, everything they saw.

286
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And so in some way, what was happening to this man is a reflection of what was happening on the wider scale in the society around them.

287
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 And just as this man was longing to be freed from this legion of demons,

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 society at that point was longing to be freed from the clutches of Rome.

289
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And Rome was seen by the Jews at this time as this evil.

290
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Some people even thought that Rome was a manifestation of Satan himself.

291
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And Jesus in entering the scene though, his plan was even greater than just freeing this man.

292
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 His plan was greater than even just freeing the nation of Israel from the clutches of Rome.

293
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 His plan was to free the entire world from darkness.

294
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Jesus realizes that there's a deep spiritual battle here that needs to be won.

295
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Not just Rome, but the entire world.

296
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Romans 8.22 tells us this, "For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers together."

297
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And the ultimate way Jesus is going to defeat evil once and for all is of course on the cross.

298
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 You see, as we look at the story right here in this moment, we look at Jesus and this demon possessed man.

299
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 That doesn't seem like there's very much in common with the two of them, right?

300
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Jesus has community, he's dressed, he's healthy.

301
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 This man is naked, alone, cut up and wounded.

302
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 But actually, it's not long after meeting this man that Jesus would too end up abandoned by his disciples.

303
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Screaming in pain, put to death, left on a hill, on a cross, amongst the tombs, half naked.

304
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 His body cut up and tortured by the whips of the Roman soldiers.

305
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And the sins of the world and the evils of the world upon his shoulders.

306
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And it's three days later where the resurrection comes.

307
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 That Satan and evil and the demonic powers of this world are defeated once and for all.

308
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 So what's happening in this encounter with this demon possessed man,

309
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 it's simply a smaller scale demonstration of what Jesus has ultimately come to do.

310
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And this is the truth, church.

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Jesus is and will be victorious over all sin and evil in this world.

312
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And this legion of demons inside this man already knows what's up.

313
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 This is how the story ends.

314
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 A large herd of pigs were feeding on a hillside nearby.

315
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs, allow us to go into them."

316
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 He gave them permission and the in-power spirits came out and went into the pigs.

317
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And the demons heard about 2,000 in numbers rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.

318
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 It's a pretty dramatic scene.

319
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Imagine the commotions.

320
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 But what this is really proclaiming is this.

321
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 One day, the fate of all evil, Satan and his demons will ultimately be cast out and destroyed.

322
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 The fate of evil is always going to be defeat in the name of Jesus.

323
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Because this is what Jesus comes to do.

324
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 This is what Jesus is all about.

325
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Defeating evil, overcoming trauma, and restoring people.

326
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And it says this.

327
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there,

328
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 dressed and in his right mind, and the community was afraid.

329
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 This is what happens when Jesus heals.

330
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 The change is dramatic.

331
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Blind can see, the lame can walk, dead come back to life, rich give to poor,

332
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 and the demon possessed are set free from their torment.

333
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I want us to realize this, church.

334
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Healing is possible.

335
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 If you're waiting for God's healing right now, healing is possible.

336
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Overcoming trauma is possible.

337
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 There will be coming a time where you will not be tormented by whatever it is that you're wrestling with anymore.

338
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And surely this is something that we can all celebrate, right?

339
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 But this community reacts in fear.

340
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Why?

341
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 What were they afraid of?

342
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Maybe they were afraid in the same way that the disciples were afraid that we talked about just now.

343
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 This man has just suddenly controlled this guy we've been trying to control all this time.

344
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 How can that be?

345
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Maybe they were scared about the fact that they just lost 2,000 pigs,

346
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 which would have been a huge financial loss for them.

347
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 If Jesus stuck around, maybe the financial losses would be even worse.

348
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 But how about us, church?

349
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 This is a question we need to ask ourselves.

350
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Do we want to see stories like this man become real in our community?

351
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Do we really want to see people break free from the traumatic things that have been plaguing their life?

352
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Because if we do, we need to prepare ourselves to walk in some of the messy things that come along with that.

353
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 It's going to cost us something.

354
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 But we don't need to be afraid of the enemy and his schemes.

355
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 We need to overcome our fear of welcoming those who are coming in with the wounds and scars and demons,

356
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 broken and in need of help, and simply be a place where we can allow the presence of God to be at work in their lives.

357
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 But here's something more amazing that I want us to see.

358
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 In healing this man, Jesus didn't just cast out his demons,

359
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 but more importantly, Jesus gave him something new to live for.

360
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 This is how the story really ends.

361
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Pastors always do that.

362
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 They say, "I'm coming to an end," and then they don't come to an end.

363
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I'm really coming to an end now.

364
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.

365
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your own people.

366
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you."

367
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 So the man went away and began to tell the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him.

368
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And all the people were amazed.

369
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You see, when this man was demon-possessed, there was nothing he had to appreciate about life.

370
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 He lived in the tombs. He lived among darkness.

371
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 There was nothing that he could appreciate.

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 But one of the most crucial steps in our journey of post-traumatic growth is that once we are made well,

373
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 once we have been healed, our task is not just to keep Jesus to ourselves.

374
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Our task, like this man, is to go and tell others.

375
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Jesus has something even better for him than staying with him.

376
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 He says, "I've got something better for you.

377
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Go and tell everyone what the Lord has done for you.

378
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 The demons are gone. New life is here."

379
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And this new life doesn't mean all memory about his past trauma has been erased.

380
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Like I said, rather it tells him to go.

381
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Share the pain that you've been through.

382
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 And in a very strange way, isn't it, church,

383
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 that one of the gifts we get out of coming out of traumatic experience is an even more deeper appreciation of the life that we've been given?

384
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 As I say this, I'm thinking about people like Alfred here.

385
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 If you read the devotional last Sunday, you would have read about Alfred

386
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 and how despite his ongoing battles to get healthy, he continues to appreciate each day.

387
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I was just on a Zoom call with him yesterday, Alfred.

388
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And church, he's having surgery on Tuesday.

389
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 So if you would join me in praying for him, that would be amazing.

390
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 But believe me when I tell you that Alfred is truly a guy who lives appreciating life every single day.

391
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 He preaches hope to the young adult community that he's part of way better than a sermon ever could.

392
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Alfred, if you're watching this, we want you to know that we love you and we're praying for you.

393
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Of course, I'm thinking about my friend Chelsea here,

394
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 who in the midst of a pain and life looking totally different now, still continues to be a wonderful mom to Emery,

395
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 an amazing friend to those around her and a voice of raw and real honesty about how God is walking with her in life.

396
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And Chelsea, if you're watching this, know that we continue to love you and walk alongside you too.

397
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And this formerly possessed man, despite all the pain and shame that would have come of being that guy,

398
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 imagine being that guy for that long, he goes around now to travel and proclaim the freedom Jesus has given to him.

399
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 I found a really good quote as I was scrolling through Instagram.

400
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Some good stuff does come from Instagram.

401
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And it was from an account by a psychologist called Dr.

402
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Caroline Leaf.

403
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And she said this.

404
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 She says, don't be ashamed of your trauma or history.

405
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 One day, your story will become someone else's survival guide and inspiration.

406
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 By sharing your story of tragedy and triumph, someone may find the hope and courage to continue waiting.

407
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And I would add to that by sharing what God has done in your life, someone too will be encouraged by the presence of God.

408
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Now, I have no idea about the things, most of the things that you guys are wrestling with right now or what you've been through.

409
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 But what I do know is this.

410
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 What I do know is the words, the story that we've just read are true.

411
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And I hope that in walking past this passage today, you can see that.

412
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Firstly, yes, there is healing in Jesus name.

413
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Every single thing that we wrestle with can and will be brought under the healing power, the healing power of Jesus.

414
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 But after healing church, there is life.

415
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And when Jesus comes to storm in our life, when he frees us from the things that torment us, we are to live life appreciating each and every moment.

416
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And what Jesus did for this demon possessed man, he can do for you, for your family, for society and for the world.

417
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Our task then is simply to be proclaimers and believers of this wonderful news that in the name of Jesus is life and life in the fullest.

418
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 So church, please join me in prayer right now, as I would just spend a little bit of time praying and listening to God and seeing how he wants to bring you out into a journey of trauma, into appreciating life again.

419
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Pray with me church.

420
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Jesus, I thank you that there is nothing under your sovereign control, the wind and the waves, the universe, everything we see around us, including our own selves, including the forces of evil have been brought under your power.

421
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And so Lord, I pray for those, those of us who are listening, who are watching right now, who are still feel like themselves are being tossed and turned by the sea, who are still being plagued by sickness and evil.

422
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Lord, we pray for a release of that right now in Jesus name.

423
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 We pray for calm in Jesus name.

424
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 We pray for demons to cease their work in Jesus name.

425
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 And Father, I pray that you would bring us out of this darkness into a place of healing, into a place where we can truly appreciate this wonderful gift of life that you've given to each and every single one of us.

426
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And as we do that, Lord, I pray that our lives would be a proclamation of who you are, a demonstration of your love.

427
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 We would reach out in love and kindness.

428
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 We would use the pain that we've been through to speak hope and love and joy in your name to those around us.

429
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 So Jesus, we thank you.

430
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 We love you.

431
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Come rescue us.

432
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Come heal us.

433
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Come give us life.

434
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 In your beautiful name.

435
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,800
 Amen.
