1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 - Thank you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,960
 Good morning.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,840
 I said this to the first service

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,920
 and I'll say it to you as well.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,440
 You may have come to church thinking

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,900
 that this will just be another normal Sunday.

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,580
 You're going to be disappointed.

8
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,240
 God responds to desperation.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,760
 He responds to longing.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,080
 And I don't know about you,

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,820
 but these are two things that I find in my life,

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,640
 in various stages of life,

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,320
 but I find desperation and longing

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,020
 is sometimes our constant companions at time.

15
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,600
 And to those of you who are online today,

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,920
 you might be sitting there with a cuppa.

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,200
 Maybe you have a dog on your lap,

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,520
 if it's anything like I am when I'm at home.

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,260
 But also in that room is the presence of God.

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,680
 And he will be there to encounter you

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,160
 if you are willing as well.

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,240
 Some weeks ago during worship,

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,120
 Emma said that the one thing that all the encounters

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,820
 we've been looking at during this series,

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,620
 the one thing they had in common was desperation.

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,920
 So desperation, what is it?

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,300
 And how does it connect to encounters with God?

28
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,920
 Today we're looking at the story of Hannah.

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,840
 So let's begin with the first part of her story.

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,760
 We're going to be reading a lot of scripture today,

31
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,880
 so strap yourselves in.

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,440
 Now there was a certain man of Ramatham, Zohem,

33
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,160
 of the mountains of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah,

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,120
 the son of Jerahim, the son of Elihu,

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,040
 the son of Tohu, the son of Zoph, and Ephraimite.

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,480
 And he had two wives, the name of one was Hannah,

37
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,520
 and the name of the other was Peninnah.

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,200
 Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,120
 This man went up from his city yearly

40
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,560
 to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh.

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,240
 Also the two sons of Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas,

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,760
 the priests of the Lord, were there.

43
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,480
 And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering,

44
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,240
 he would give portions to Peninnah, his wife,

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,080
 and to all his sons and daughters.

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,640
 But to Hannah he would give a double portion,

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,000
 for he loved Hannah,

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,680
 although the Lord had closed her womb.

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,360
 And her rival also provoked her severely

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,400
 to make her miserable,

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,960
 because the Lord had closed her womb.

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,920
 So it was year by year,

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,960
 when she went up to the house of the Lord,

54
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,520
 that she provoked her.

55
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,280
 Therefore she wept and did not eat.

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,040
 Then Elkanah, her husband, said to her,

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,520
 "Hannah, why do you weep?

58
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,720
 "Why do you not eat?

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,840
 "And why is your heart grieved?

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,560
 "Am I not better to you than ten sons?"

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,800
 So Hannah arose after they'd finished eating

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,600
 and drinking in Shiloh.

63
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,800
 Now Eli the priest was sitting on the step

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,400
 of the doorpost of the tabernacle of the Lord,

65
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,640
 and she was in bitterness of soul

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,680
 and prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish.

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,520
 I've just realised that my notes are all the way

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,040
 around the wrong way, so just hold on one second.

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,840
 I've got page nine next after page one.

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
 Just wait for one second.

71
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,560
 We'll just reorder them.

72
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,520
 Nearly there.

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,720
 Okay.

74
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,760
 Thank you for being so patient.

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,920
 The writer makes sure that the very first thing

76
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,320
 we learn about Hannah is that she has no children.

77
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,960
 Elkanah has two wives, Peninnah and Hannah.

78
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,320
 Peninnah had children,

79
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,200
 but Hannah had none.

80
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,960
 So why is this significant?

81
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,240
 In Hannah's day, it was considered so shameful

82
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,560
 to be barren that your husband could divorce you.

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,040
 A barren woman could be treated harshly by the community

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,760
 because children were seen as blessings.

85
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,200
 And if you couldn't have children,

86
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,360
 you're perceived as being the opposite of being blessed.

87
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,320
 You are seen as being cursed.

88
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,000
 1 Samuel 1:8 and verse 10 captures the essence

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,320
 of her desperation.

90
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,760
 Listen to these words again.

91
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,480
 Hannah, why do you weep?

92
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,920
 Why do you not eat?

93
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,560
 Why is your heart grieved?

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,560
 And it goes on to say, Hannah was in bitterness of soul

95
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,000
 and prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish.

96
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,760
 Desperation is a state of extreme distress,

97
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,440
 extreme anxiety or despair.

98
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,080
 It's caused by a feeling of complete helplessness

99
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
 or absence of hope.

100
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,240
 Hannah was desperate.

101
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,960
 She was in despair.

102
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,720
 Her husband's other wife, Peninnah, severely

103
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,920
 and deliberately provokes her to make her miserable.

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,240
 And the Bible tells us that she has endured this for years.

105
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,720
 Hannah is suffering from maret nefesh,

106
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,920
 which means a bitter soul,

107
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,720
 and ani, which means affliction.

108
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,720
 Let's take a moment to examine the reason

109
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,600
 why Hannah is experiencing affliction.

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,000
 The Bible says that the Lord had closed her womb.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,200
 She is childless because of the Lord.

112
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,040
 She is suffering because the Lord is allowing it.

113
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,600
 In the Bible, all forms of fertility

114
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
 are presented as gifts from God.

115
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,200
 So why was God keeping Hannah childless

116
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,000
 and allowing her to endure the ridicule

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,560
 of the people around her?

118
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,560
 Now, it's important in this moment to understand

119
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,600
 that God doesn't use infertility as a punishment.

120
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,720
 But in Hannah's case, He was withholding children from her.

121
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,680
 Before we explore this further,

122
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,120
 we need to understand that Hannah's not the only one

123
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,640
 in the Bible who suffers affliction,

124
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,560
 who suffers from a bitter soul.

125
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,200
 Naomi, after the death of her sons and her husband,

126
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,640
 renames herself Marah, which means bitter.

127
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,160
 And Job speaks in the bitterness of his spirit

128
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,200
 after enduring the loss of his family and all that he owned.

129
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,560
 And yet all these desperate people have one thing in common.

130
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,200
 Their desperation drives them to encounter God

131
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,840
 and to discover that God can work through their afflictions

132
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,040
 to bring them to a place of greater surrender

133
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,280
 and fruitfulness.

134
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,040
 Hannah's desperation drove her to encounter God.

135
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,920
 It could have driven her away,

136
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,280
 but instead it pushes her in closer.

137
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,280
 She chooses to trust and she pours out her soul to God.

138
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,640
 Let's read 1 Samuel 1, verses 11 to 18.

139
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,840
 Then she made a vow and said, "O Lord of hosts,

140
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,600
 "if you will indeed look on the affliction

141
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,640
 "of your maidservant and remember me

142
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,200
 "and not forget your maidservant,

143
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,360
 "but will give your maidservant a male child,

144
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,720
 "then I will give him to the Lord

145
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,000
 "all the days of his life

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
 "and no razor shall come upon his head."

147
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,600
 And it happened as she continued praying before the Lord

148
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
 that Eli watched her mouth.

149
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,400
 Now Hannah spoke in her heart, only her lips moved,

150
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,640
 but her voice was not heard.

151
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,440
 Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.

152
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,480
 So Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunk?

153
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,000
 "Put your wine away from you."

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,480
 But Hannah answered and said, "No, my Lord,

155
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,160
 "I am a woman of sorrowful spirit.

156
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,160
 "I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink,

157
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,240
 "but have poured out my soul before the Lord.

158
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,440
 "Do not consider your maidservant a wicked woman,

159
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,080
 "for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief,

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,480
 "I have spoken until now."

161
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,600
 Then Eli answered and said, "Go in peace

162
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,080
 "and the God of Israel grant your petition

163
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,120
 "which you have asked of him."

164
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,040
 And she said, "Let your maidservant find favour in your sight."

165
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,240
 So the woman went her way and ate

166
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,040
 and her face was no longer sad.

167
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,240
 Just wanna take a moment here.

168
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,200
 Something that I kind of,

169
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,960
 when I was reading these scriptures came to mind.

170
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,760
 You know, when people are desperate,

171
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,840
 when they are grieving, when they're in despair,

172
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
 when they feel helpless,

173
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,680
 they are not themselves.

174
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,400
 And in these scriptures we see that Eli

175
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,640
 misunderstood Hannah in the first instance

176
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,840
 and he judged her.

177
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,040
 And it can be very easy when we're surrounded

178
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,760
 by people sometimes who are desperate

179
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,880
 or walking alongside them.

180
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,880
 Sometimes it can be easy to misunderstand, easy to judge.

181
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,200
 But I want us to be challenged by these scriptures

182
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,200
 that in the end Eli becomes a source of blessing instead.

183
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,600
 And he speaks peace over Hannah.

184
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,920
 And when she leaves him, her face is no longer sad.

185
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,440
 And I believe that there's a challenge in this to us

186
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,600
 because sometimes we are the desperate ones

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,400
 but sometimes we are walking with someone who is desperate.

188
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,920
 May our heart response not be judgment.

189
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,200
 But may it be compassion and blessing.

190
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,360
 Hannah's desperation and barrenness

191
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,200
 prompted her to make commitments and vows

192
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,440
 that she would have never have made otherwise.

193
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,280
 Maybe we need to understand just how desperate

194
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,080
 our condition is, how fragile our lives can be

195
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,360
 because unless we do, we are never going to see

196
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,800
 our equally desperate need for God.

197
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,160
 Desperation is characterized by a sense of urgency,

198
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,200
 a need for immediate relief.

199
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,200
 Desperation has a purpose.

200
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,760
 Desperation is meant to drive us into the arms of God.

201
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,240
 At the end of 2007, my husband Glenn and my four children,

202
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,400
 we packed up our lives in Darwin

203
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,000
 and we returned to Queensland in Australia

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,240
 to say our final goodbyes to family and friends

205
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,400
 because we were moving to Hong Kong

206
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,360
 to continue to work for a Christian NGO.

207
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,680
 This was in response to God's leading

208
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,120
 and everything had been miraculous up to this point.

209
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,920
 We had been gifted money out of the blue

210
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,480
 that covered all of our expenses

211
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
 and all of our plane tickets.

212
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
 We arrived in Queensland and our planned month stay

213
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,720
 before we left for Hong Kong turned into another month

214
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,600
 and then another month.

215
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,200
 Something had caused a holdup with our visas

216
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,400
 and no one could give us a clear answer

217
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,080
 to what was going on.

218
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,240
 We had four kids aged between three and 11

219
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,160
 and we were living like nomads,

220
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,560
 moving from friends and family,

221
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,320
 sleeping on mattresses on the floor,

222
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,440
 spending weeks on farms

223
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,640
 and I was trying to teach our kids

224
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,280
 because the one month had turned into longer

225
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,720
 and they needed to have education.

226
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,520
 Our one month turned into eight long months of waiting.

227
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,160
 I distinctly remember when we reached the eight month mark

228
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,080
 and there didn't seem to be an end in sight.

229
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,240
 We were at my parents' house

230
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,600
 and I went into the toilet and just sat there.

231
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,920
 If you've got children, you'll know,

232
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,440
 sometimes that's the only place you can be by yourself

233
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,000
 and sometimes not even then.

234
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,120
 I remember feeling so desperate

235
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,880
 and I remember crying out to God in anguish and in despair.

236
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,760
 I reminded Him that He had brought us to this place,

237
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,440
 that it was in response to His leading

238
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,640
 that we were in this place.

239
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,040
 This land of the in-between.

240
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,520
 Have you experienced that place?

241
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,920
 The land of the in-between?

242
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,240
 You're not where you once were

243
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,320
 and you're not where you're meant to be going

244
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,560
 and you're stuck in this middle ground.

245
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,520
 I told God I didn't understand why we were suffering.

246
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,560
 I couldn't take it anymore.

247
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,520
 I found myself surrendering afresh.

248
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,680
 My family, my future.

249
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,720
 And I told God, "You have to come through."

250
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,520
 It was in that same week that we heard

251
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,200
 that our visa applications had finally been approved.

252
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,520
 When we arrived in Hong Kong,

253
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,560
 I saw our kids who had endured such change

254
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,200
 in the last eight months,

255
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,120
 such upheaval.

256
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,400
 They hadn't had a home.

257
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,680
 They hadn't had proper schooling.

258
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,280
 But I saw them quickly adapt to Hong Kong.

259
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,360
 It felt so easy.

260
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,360
 It felt like perfect timing in a hundred different ways.

261
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,880
 Desperation has a season and it has a purpose.

262
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,400
 Desperation is meant to lead us to an encounter with God,

263
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,880
 a place where we discover hope, peace,

264
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,240
 a place where we discover we can depend on God,

265
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,640
 a place where we can experience greater fruitfulness.

266
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,720
 Hannah's desperation drives her to God.

267
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,160
 In her deep anguish, Hannah prayed.

268
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,960
 Prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly,

269
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,120
 she vowed, "Lord Almighty,

270
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,960
 if you will only look on your servant's misery

271
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,080
 and remember me and not forget your servant,

272
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,640
 but give me a son,

273
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,480
 I will give him to you for all the days of his life."

274
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,480
 Hannah's desperation drove her to God.

275
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,120
 Where is your desperation driving you?

276
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,760
 Is your desperation causing you to try to figure out life

277
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,720
 on your own?

278
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:27,080
 Is it driving you to places that you were never meant to go?

279
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,680
 Or is it causing you to rely on things

280
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,240
 that you were never meant to place your trust in?

281
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,600
 You see, there are many stories in the Bible

282
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,040
 of desperate people.

283
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,800
 And one of them, Jonah,

284
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,600
 his desperation drove him into the darkness

285
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,840
 of the belly of a big fish.

286
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,640
 Has your desperation driven you into some dark places?

287
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,400
 When we choose to let our desperation drive us to God,

288
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
 we encounter him.

289
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,200
 Why?

290
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,840
 Because he hears the cries of the desperate.

291
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,920
 And he responds.

292
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,400
 He promises.

293
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,920
 He says, "Draw near to me and I will draw near to you."

294
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,520
 Psalm 107 reminds us that no matter the cause

295
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,960
 of our desperation,

296
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,360
 when we cry out to the Lord,

297
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,360
 he hears us and he delivers us from our distress.

298
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,760
 Psalm 147 verse three says,

299
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,760
 "He heals the brokenhearted and he binds up our wounds."

300
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,640
 Hannah cries out to God and her desperation

301
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,440
 causes her to encounter God

302
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,280
 and she experiences his faithfulness.

303
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,560
 She regains her hope and her life becomes a better place

304
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,160
 and her life becomes far more fruitful

305
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,080
 than she could have ever imagined.

306
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,360
 We pick up the story from 1 Samuel 1 verses 19 to 28.

307
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,960
 Then they rose early in the morning

308
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,400
 and worshipped before the Lord

309
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,400
 and returned and came to their house at Ramah.

310
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,720
 And Elkanah knew Hannah, his wife,

311
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,040
 and the Lord remembered her.

312
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,600
 So it came to pass in the process of time

313
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,360
 that Hannah conceived and bore a son

314
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,200
 and called his name Samuel,

315
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,960
 saying, "Because I have asked for him from the Lord."

316
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,200
 Now the man Elkanah and all his house

317
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,640
 went up to offer the Lord the yearly sacrifice

318
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,880
 and his vow,

319
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,720
 but Hannah did not go up,

320
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
 for she said to her husband,

321
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,560
 "Not until the child is weaned,

322
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,560
 then I will take him that he may appear before the Lord

323
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,720
 and remain there forever."

324
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,440
 So Elkanah, her husband, said to her,

325
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,120
 "Do what seems best to you.

326
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,160
 Wait until you have weaned him.

327
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,240
 Only let the Lord establish his word."

328
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,160
 Then the woman stayed and nursed her son

329
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,000
 until she had weaned him.

330
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,160
 Now when she had weaned him,

331
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,360
 she took him up with her with three bulls,

332
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,240
 one ephah of flour and a skin of wine,

333
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,760
 and brought him to the house of the Lord in Shiloh,

334
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
 and the child was young.

335
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,560
 Then they slaughtered a bull

336
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,440
 and brought the child to Eli,

337
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,360
 and she said, "Oh my Lord, as your soul lives, my Lord,

338
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 I am the woman who stood by you here praying to the Lord.

339
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,120
 For this child I prayed,

340
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,880
 and the Lord has granted me my petition,

341
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,520
 which I asked of him.

342
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,760
 Therefore, I also have lent him to the Lord.

343
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,840
 As long as he lives, he shall be lent to the Lord."

344
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,240
 So they worshipped the Lord there.

345
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,160
 Hannah receives a son.

346
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,880
 She names him Samuel, meaning God has heard.

347
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,840
 And God redeems all her affliction.

348
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,240
 He redeems all her suffering

349
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,080
 by unveiling his wondrous plan.

350
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,720
 You see, Samuel goes on to serve as a priest.

351
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,720
 He becomes the first prophet and the last judge of Israel.

352
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:08,080
 Samuel's life was pivotal in Israel's history.

353
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,480
 If Hannah had not walked the journey she did,

354
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,000
 would she have been willing to surrender the one thing

355
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,720
 she wanted more than anything in this world, a child?

356
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,720
 I don't think so.

357
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,520
 Some of you here today are wrestling with God

358
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,360
 because he is challenging you to surrender something

359
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,800
 in your life that is very precious to you.

360
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,680
 It could be a dream for a spouse, a dream for a child.

361
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,200
 He might be challenging you about an unhealthy relationship

362
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
 that he wants you to let go of.

363
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,880
 It could be a job that has become everything to you.

364
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,760
 You're sitting here today and you know what it's like

365
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,400
 to feel afflicted, to not have peace.

366
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,600
 Let your desperation drive you to God,

367
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,440
 drive you to surrender all those things into his hands.

368
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,480
 You see, like Hannah, God's plans for you are better.

369
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,680
 They far surpass your own.

370
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,200
 Choose to trust like Hannah did, that his plans for you

371
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,560
 are to prosper you, to give you a future and a hope.

372
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,440
 Hannah surrenders Samuel because she comes to understand

373
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,960
 that all good things, they come from God.

374
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,320
 There's a lesson here.

375
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,320
 We are not to hold on tightly to the things God gives us.

376
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,680
 We need to be willing to have open hands

377
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,120
 and a surrendered heart.

378
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,920
 Hannah in her surrender discovers that when we do surrender

379
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,000
 God pours so much more into our lives.

380
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,800
 Listen to her prayer after she surrenders Samuel

381
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
 to the temple.

382
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,120
 My heart rejoices in the Lord.

383
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,080
 In the Lord my horn is lifted high,

384
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,320
 my mouth boasts over my enemies,

385
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,400
 for I delight in your deliverance.

386
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,920
 There is no one holy like the Lord.

387
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,540
 There is no one besides you.

388
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,740
 There is no rock like our God.

389
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,700
 Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak

390
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,080
 such arrogance, for the Lord is a God who knows

391
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,720
 and by Him deeds are weighed.

392
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,400
 The bows of the warriors are broken,

393
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
 but those who stumbled are armed with strength.

394
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,140
 Those who were full hire themselves out for food,

395
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,980
 but those who were hungry are hungry no more.

396
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,740
 She who was barren has born seven children,

397
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,520
 but she who has had many sons pines away.

398
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,500
 The Lord brings death and makes alive,

399
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,340
 He brings down to the grave and raises up.

400
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,360
 The Lord sends poverty and wealth,

401
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,240
 He humbles and He exalts.

402
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,040
 He raises the poor from the dust

403
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,840
 and lifts the needy from the ash heap.

404
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,000
 He seats them with princes and has them inherit

405
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
 a throne of honour.

406
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,660
 For the foundations of the earth are the Lord's,

407
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,520
 on them He has set the world.

408
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,080
 He will guard the feet of His faithful servants,

409
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,320
 but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness.

410
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,580
 It is not by strength that one prevails.

411
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,400
 Those who oppose the Lord will be broken.

412
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,140
 The most high will thunder from heaven,

413
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,020
 the Lord will judge the ends of the earth,

414
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,900
 He will give strength to His King

415
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,340
 and exalt the horn of His anointed.

416
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,880
 Hannah worships God because she gets a glimpse

417
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,880
 of His sovereignty and how everything in our lives

418
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,440
 can be worked together for good

419
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,840
 when we are willing to live a surrendered life.

420
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,500
 Hannah goes on to be blessed with five more children.

421
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,680
 God never intended her to stay barren and desperate

422
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,100
 and neither does He desire that for you.

423
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:20,040
 If you are feeling barren, if you are feeling empty,

424
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,040
 closed up, shut up, lifeless, hopeless, helpless,

425
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,960
 unfruitful, desperate or in despair,

426
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,460
 if you have been praying and longing for something

427
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,040
 for so long and feel as though God has forgotten you,

428
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,680
 know that in all of this, it has a season

429
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,200
 and it has a purpose.

430
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,200
 You were never meant to stay in this place of desperation.

431
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,620
 Let it lead you to an encounter with God.

432
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,620
 Like Hannah, pour out your soul and cry out, "Remember me."

433
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,660
 Can you stand with me today?

434
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:11,720
 Can you just close your eyes

435
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,320
 and let every distraction just fade away?

436
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,900
 (gentle music)

437
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,560
 Hannah's desperation was not of her own making.

438
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,440
 God had woven it into her story

439
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,140
 to bring her to a place of surrender,

440
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,800
 to draw her into His greatest story and purpose.

441
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,320
 Some of you here today are like Hannah.

442
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,600
 You are experiencing desperation

443
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,560
 but it is not of your own making.

444
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,880
 God has woven it into your story

445
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,600
 to bring you to a place of surrender.

446
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,960
 But some of you here today,

447
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,720
 you are experiencing desperation, deep dissatisfaction,

448
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,860
 even despair and it is of your own making.

449
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,320
 Your choices have led you into some dark places,

450
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,880
 some empty places,

451
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,960
 places that lured with the promise of so much

452
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,540
 but have left you feeling hollow and ashamed.

453
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:24,180
 Let your desperation drive you into the arms of God.

454
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:30,260
 And some today, you are not desperate enough.

455
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,360
 You're complacent.

456
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,500
 You're letting life just wash over you.

457
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,080
 The words directionless and meaningless,

458
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,640
 you know those words.

459
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,360
 Ephesians 5:14 says,

460
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,160
 Awake you who sleep,

461
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,840
 arise from the dead and Christ will give you light.

462
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,240
 Encounter God today.

463
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,100
 Surrender and receive His light,

464
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,340
 receive His presence.

465
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,100
 (gentle music)

466
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,180
 As the worship team begin to worship over us,

467
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,940
 I wanna leave you with this picture from Ezekiel.

468
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:25,420
 In Ezekiel, a man calls him into a river

469
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,360
 and it's a river made of water

470
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,140
 that flows from the temple of God.

471
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,220
 It's the presence of God.

472
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,700
 And Ezekiel is called into the river

473
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,020
 and he's called at first to ankle deep.

474
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,900
 And then he's called on to knee deep.

475
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,600
 And then he's called into his waist.

476
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,100
 And then he's called to a place

477
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,300
 where he can no longer touch,

478
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,900
 into the raging river,

479
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,900
 a river where he is completely at the mercy

480
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,020
 of God's presence.

481
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,220
 Where his feet are no longer on the ground,

482
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,620
 where he is completely surrendered,

483
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,960
 where he has no longer control.

484
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,740
 And it's a reminder here today

485
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,380
 that you were never meant to stand ankle deep

486
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,820
 in God's presence.

487
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:30,340
 God is calling us all to encounter Him

488
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,900
 in a place where we have surrendered

489
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,540
 all control into His hands

490
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,440
 and we are in His river, His presence,

491
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,620
 where He is in complete control.

492
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,700
 So today we're gonna create some space

493
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,900
 and time right now for you to encounter God.

494
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:57,500
 For you to just figure out where you are.

495
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,740
 Are you on the bank of the river?

496
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,300
 Far from God's presence?

497
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,020
 Or are you in the shallows?

498
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,980
 Wherever you are,

499
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,900
 God's call to you and promise to you is,

500
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,100
 if you walk in,

501
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,460
 if you surrender,

502
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,660
 if you trust Him,

503
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,860
 He will meet you in the depths of the river.

504
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,440
 (gentle music)

505
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,260
 (gentle music)

506
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,840
 (gentle music)

507
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,420
 (gentle music)

508
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,000
 (gentle music)

509
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,580
 (gentle music)
