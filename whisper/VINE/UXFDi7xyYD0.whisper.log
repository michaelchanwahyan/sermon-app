[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   What an introduction, I'm now so scared.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.360]   But let me also tell you a little bit about myself.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.840]   There are a few things that you might find interesting about me.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.080]   First of all, when I was young, I'm really not good at reading.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.680]   Well, maybe not even not good at, I'm scared of reading English books.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.000]   When I was young, if I see an English book on the floor,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.320]   I will not touch it, because I know that if I touch it,
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.120]   I'll be responsible for it.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.360]   That means I'll have to read it, and I'm not reading it.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.520]   So I'll just let the English book lie on the floor peacefully,
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.520]   and I'll just detour around it.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.800]   And lucky for me to start teaching English for 10 years in my past 10
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.320]   years, so well done, students.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.720]   Another surprising thing about me is that sometimes I
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.040]   listen to really loud music to relax.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.200]   I find that the louder and more upbeat the music,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.440]   the more calming it is for me.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.360]   Like, it feels so calm when I just hear music blasting in my ear.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.400]   I don't know, did anyone of that find loud music calming?
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.720]   Awesome, good, good.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.360]   Yeah, right?
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.320]   Another interesting thing about me, well, my friends find about me
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.000]   is that I'm good at connecting with people now.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.400]   I have an ex-colleague/friend who was quite surprised that I can actually
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.840]   talk to strangers now when I meet new people.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.160]   Last time she saw me on my IG Reels talking about the friends
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.480]   that I met in Australia, and then she met me, and they go, June,
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.880]   you made friends in Australia?
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.920]   I'm like, yeah.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.360]   And I've been friends with her for over 10 years.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.040]   And I've met her not only--
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.360]   not like, oh, I've met her once every five months.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.400]   No, I meet her every single day when we were at work.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.160]   Even though I left the place that we worked together,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.240]   I still meet her like once or twice every week.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.680]   And she still finds me surprising that I can make friends and connect
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.320]   with people now.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.280]   Maybe that's because we've been friends for so long
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.760]   that we've stopped thinking or knowing about each other.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.720]   We've stopped knowing anything fresh or the small changes
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.120]   that happens in us every day.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.080]   We all need fresh encounters in our relationships,
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.440]   whether it is with our friends that we've known for a long time,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.480]   our spouse, or even with God.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.320]   Maybe you have been a Christian for a long time,
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.920]   and seeking fresh encounter with Jesus is something
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.520]   that you've always thought--
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.120]   you've always wanted.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.000]   You've known Jesus for a long time, and then the more that you know him,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.080]   the more that you come to church to listen to sermons and read the Bible,
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.440]   and you go, yeah.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.320]   Whenever June talked about the five fish and the two loaves,
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.160]   I know what she's going to talk about.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.360]   Or you open up the Bible, and you read Psalms 1,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.280]   and you go, I know exactly how this is going to be.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.600]   This is another story that I've learned since I was in kids ministry.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.800]   And you need that fresh encounter, and you just
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   don't know how to get it or where to begin.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.880]   I hope that this message speaks to you about how
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.800]   to journey through those moments and find fresh encounter with Jesus.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.400]   Maybe you are just a new Christian or not yet a Christian,
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.720]   but you have made assumptions with, you know, I think God is like that.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.040]   I've heard that God looks like that, or Jesus is like that.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.000]   And you kind of need someone to tell you who Jesus is through his word.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.640]   And I hope that this message is going to shine some light on you
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.960]   to show you a pathway of how I did it when I was young
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.160]   and how I do it when I was walking through some ups and downs when
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.640]   I connect with the word of God.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.520]   As I was praying for the sermon, I feel that God
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.040]   is saying that last week, since last week,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.520]   it is an important week for all of us because we just
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.000]   came out of a 21-day fast.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.600]   And in those 21 days, as a church, we fasted
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.320]   from things that were distracting us from God, maybe things that we eat,
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.160]   maybe thinking about, you know, constantly thinking about what to eat next.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.040]   That's kind of like my life.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.920]   Or maybe you were watching Netflix and you fasted from Netflix
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.480]   and you carved out time to be with God, to pray and to read.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.320]   And every day, the church would send out devotionals,
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.480]   sharings from people about how they encounter God.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.320]   And there would be scriptures and questions that came out of the sharing.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.680]   And then, wow, every single morning, I just look forward
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.360]   to the sharings that I'm going to read and the question that really helped me
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.960]   to respond to or think about my life or think about how I start that morning.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.400]   But then last week, I woke up and there's nothing.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.960]   I'm like, "Chapman, where's the sharing?"
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.640]   I wanted to text him that.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.720]   I didn't because there's no more sharing from other people telling me how they
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   encountered Jesus' life.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.720]   All I have is the scriptures in my hands right now that I have to wrestle with,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.120]   that I have to sit with to encounter Jesus on my own.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.880]   So this week, I hope that as we just came out of the fast, that we're able to,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.840]   still as a church, continue our connection with God, continue our walk with God,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.160]   not from other people's help, not through other people's encounter,
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.840]   but our own fresh encounter with Jesus.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.440]   So today, let's begin our fresh encounter with Him through His Word.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.960]   The Word is His revelation to us.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.840]   It is wonderful and precious and a joy to read.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.400]   Should it be?
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.360]   Isn't it?
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.440]   But that's not how I felt at the very beginning.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.440]   When I first began reading the Bible, I find life's big questions that I can
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.240]   give answers to, how I live my life and give me the positive energy that I need
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.000]   to live my life.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.600]   But that kind of...that way of describing the Bible kind of threw me off a bit
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.040]   because there are two kinds of people.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.000]   There's one kind that can follow instructions really well,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.640]   and there's this one kind that can't.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.200]   I'm definitely the kind that struggles with it.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.520]   Let me tell you, when I first arrived in Australia a few years ago,
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.400]   the first task after I put down my luggage in my shared room was to build the
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.000]   Ikea bed.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.440]   It was the hardest thing for me to do.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.840]   I was exhausted after my 10-hour red-eye flight.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.600]   And when I opened the manual, I could not, for the life,
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.240]   for the sake of my life, put it together.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.160]   I couldn't understand the pictures.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.960]   I mixed up the screw sizes.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.240]   And I just don't think the instructions work at all.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.520]   Can you put the Ikea bed together?
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.880]   Like, no, I can't.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.760]   I come from Hong Kong.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.080]   I'm like, "I can't put this together where I'm sleeping tonight."
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.000]   And when I read the Bible as the manual or instructions for my life,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.160]   that's how I feel too.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   Often when I turn to the Bible for instructions, I'm already at my
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.040]   wits' end.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.120]   I must have been, you know, looking and searching for how to solve my
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.320]   life's problem, and reading the Bible is my last resort.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.840]   So I'm probably overwhelmed and sad and exhausted.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.520]   And then when I read the Bible, I feel the instructions are so out of date
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.880]   and not related to my current situation.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.160]   Which verse in the Bible tells me if I should accept the job offer?
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.440]   How do I make sense of the instructions?
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.920]   Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.320]   You know, what does that mean?
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.760]   And let alone the boring incidents about how Israel was split into two,
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.880]   and the mystical book of the Revelations.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.320]   Because of these obstacles, reading the Bible seemed like a chore.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.840]   I thought to be a good Christian, which I wanted to be a good Christian,
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.520]   I have to read the Bible and pray.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.360]   But the struggles and obstacles made it hard for me to even open the Bible.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.600]   The words seemed mundane and boring.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.840]   I felt nothing when I read, and it seems like work.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.120]   All these made it hard for me to connect with the Bible, let alone seeing God
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.240]   through it.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.200]   I don't know if you resonate with what I was going through back then.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.120]   Maybe you're just starting the Bible reading journey, and the book seems so
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.600]   daunting to you, and you just don't know where to begin.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.840]   I remember when I first got baptized and everyone gave me Bibles,
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.160]   and it was this big, and the paper was so thin and so full of words.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.400]   Where do I begin?
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.720]   And I vowed, "Okay, I'm going to read through the Bible from, you know,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.360]   the first book to the last book."
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.200]   But then I got stuck at Leviticus.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.720]   I just couldn't get out of it.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.920]   I'm like, "I'm sorry."
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.280]   Maybe you've been a seasoned Christian, and there are times in your life you felt
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.720]   stagnant in your Bible reading, or that the Bible reading has been a habit,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.880]   and you feel like there's no new stories or parables that you have not read.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.480]   You wish to go deeper into your reading.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.280]   You long for a fresh encounter with Jesus through His words.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.160]   And what does it mean to have a fresh encounter with Jesus?
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.280]   Because I've known Jesus for 20 or 30-plus years.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.280]   What does it mean to have a fresh encounter with Jesus?
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.080]   To have a deeply rooted, evergreen, fruit-producing life like the poet
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.760]   described in Psalms 1.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.400]   Let me take you to the book of Luke, to an account that can help us to find
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.800]   some answers to our questions.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.960]   So the story is from Luke 24, and here in the story,
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.200]   Jesus has just been crucified.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.440]   Now, there are rumors that Jesus was risen from the dead, and a couple on the way
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.000]   to Emmaus had a fresh encounter with Jesus.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Let's have a look at their experience.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.200]   So verse 13, "Now the same day, two of them were going to a village called
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.880]   Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.440]   They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:28.120]   As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.160]   walked along with them, but they were kept from recognizing Him.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.880]   He asked them, 'What are you discussing together as you walk along?'
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.960]   They stood still, their faces downcast.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:48.040]   One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, 'Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.160]   who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?'
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.920]   'What things?' Jesus asked.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.640]   There were two people on the way to Emmaus.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.760]   We don't know too much about these two people, but there are a few things we know.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.920]   They were among the group of followers of Jesus, and on that day, the day that Mary
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:17.440]   Madeline and other women found out that Jesus had risen, they were walking towards Emmaus.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:23.040]   They have heard about Jesus was risen, but their reaction was different from what we
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   would have expected.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.160]   They've heard from the woman, they've heard from the disciples, but they were still downcast.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.080]   The Bible said they were kept from recognizing Jesus.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.280]   Yes, physically, they were kept from recognizing Him.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.560]   They did not know that the man who was walking towards them, who was talking to them, was
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.200]   the Jesus that they were pining for.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.680]   But I doubt if they know who Jesus was before He hung on the cross, that they still don't
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.880]   know who He truly is.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.040]   Let's listen to how they described Jesus to Jesus.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.480]   'About Jesus of Nazareth,' they replied, 'He was a prophet, powerful indeed before God
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.880]   and all the people.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.560]   And the chief priests, now rulers, handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and they
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.960]   crucified Him.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.800]   But we had hoped that He was the one who was going to redeem Israel.'
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   They have followed Jesus, they've heard about what He's done.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.440]   Maybe they've even witnessed some of His miracles.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.160]   They had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   However, not only physically they could not recognize Jesus, they probably had the wrong
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.520]   idea of Him, that they couldn't recognize Him from who He truly is.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:44.800]   In the scripture it says, they had hoped that He was the one who would redeem Israel.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.460]   This implies that Jesus' death put a stop to everything.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:56.000]   He cannot be the Savior of Israel, because who could save Israel if He is now dead?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.680]   Their past knowledge and experience has blocked them away, has blocked them from knowing who
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.280]   Jesus is.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:09.520]   And when things didn't happen according to their plan, they got disappointed, confused,
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.920]   and walked away.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.580]   That could be us, couldn't it?
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.600]   Maybe we have known Jesus for a while.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:23.640]   We've read books about Him, listened to sermons about Him, and met with Him back in the day.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.840]   And we thought we had enough information about Him.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.360]   So we have our own experience about Him, and who He is, and what He's going to do.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:39.600]   And so we pray and ask Him to do things according to our own plan, and our own understanding
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.800]   of Him.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.400]   Jesus could have left them alone.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.480]   At the end of the day, they were only two of the followers, out of the many, that had
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.480]   the wrong expectation of Him.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.980]   They weren't recorded in the Bible afterwards.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:00.520]   So Jesus could have just left them alone and gone to some more other impactful followers
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.520]   who could do something and change their lives, and so on.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.160]   But yet, Jesus came up to them.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.320]   Jesus knew they needed a fresh encounter of Him, to know Him afresh, regardless of who
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.500]   they are and what they can do.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:23.500]   He met them where they were at, disappointed, confused, overwhelmed.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:29.800]   He concealed to them who He was, and showed them through Scripture who He really is.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.920]   Because Jesus knew they needed Him to understand His words.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.960]   Let's look at verse 27.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.120]   It says, "And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, He explained to them what was
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.960]   said in all the Scriptures concerning Himself."
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.480]   Jesus could have met them in other ways.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.300]   He showed Thomas' wounds.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.900]   He cooked fish for Peter.
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:59.560]   But to these two on the road to Emmaus, He opened up the Scriptures to them, showing
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.980]   them who He really is.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.360]   He is the one that they have been reading about, but they didn't get.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.780]   He is the one that they were waiting for, that they have missed.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.540]   Maybe they were disappointed that through all those years, even though they have been
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.680]   looking meticulously over the Scriptures, looking for signs and wonders and clues about
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.960]   Him, but they still didn't get who He is.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.740]   Jesus is telling the couple and to us that He can be found in the Scriptures, that everything
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.260]   in the Scriptures point to Him.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:35.500]   The couple could see it in the past, but now they understand.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.060]   This is a fresh encounter for the couple.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.820]   They probably have been memorizing Scriptures for their whole lives.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:47.340]   They have been to synagogue week in and week out, asking questions about the Scriptures,
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.820]   looking for and waiting for Him as they do.
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.260]   But they were never sure about who the Messiah was.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.060]   But now, now it is different.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:01.780]   Now their minds are opened and they can understand what it truly means.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.980]   How exciting is that?
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.740]   No wonder the couple said to each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while He
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.580]   talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.000]   Weren't our hearts burning within us?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.420]   The revelation of who Jesus is, the Eureka moment where we understand what He is talking
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.180]   about sets fire in our hearts.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.500]   Do you remember the time when you were a little kid and you were given a really difficult
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.920]   math question and you tried this way and that way and it still didn't work?
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.860]   But then suddenly in that moment, you understand how to solve the problem, that joy in your
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.060]   heart.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.740]   And maybe there was this one time when you were trying to read and the sentences doesn't
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.740]   make sense to you.
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.860]   And you go and ask your teacher and she explained to you what's the underlying meaning of the
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.620]   story and who actually the story was pointing to.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:58.460]   And then you had this sudden realization that the story itself has a bigger meaning behind
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.700]   it and you go, "Oh, that's what the story means."
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:08.380]   That joy that you have, that Eureka moment that you have, Jesus is telling us that we
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.380]   can find the same feeling, the same burning in our hearts through the Scriptures because
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:18.700]   the whole of the Scripture is pointed to Him.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:24.260]   When the Bible is interpreted in the light of Jesus, inspired by the Holy Spirit, it
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:30.260]   has a remarkable power to speak directly and personally into our lives.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:35.260]   Like the couple on the Emmaus Road, we will sometimes find our hearts burning within us
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:40.180]   as the Lord reveals Himself to us through the Bible.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:46.420]   I believe that Jesus wants to do for you precisely what He did for that couple on the Emmaus
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.420]   Road.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.260]   His nature hasn't changed.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:58.200]   Ask and He will draw alongside you just like how He drew alongside them to open the Scriptures
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:06.000]   for you as He did for them until your heart, like theirs, begins to burn.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.540]   The couple on the Emmaus Road draws a beautiful picture of a fresh encounter with Jesus through
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:18.940]   God's words, a fresh revelation of who He is, having Him speak specifically and personally
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.340]   to them.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:26.700]   With that said, there have been so many discouraging moments where I struggle with the Word of
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:31.660]   God that I felt I get nothing out of reading the Bible.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:37.100]   I felt that God wasn't speaking to me and I didn't get my questions answered.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.040]   I didn't understand what He was trying to say.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.460]   It was then I realized there were too many "I's" in my sentences.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:52.140]   Just like reading from the IKEA manual, I was trying to get something done from reading
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.380]   it.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.980]   I wasn't reading the Bible to get to know Him.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.680]   I read the Bible with my personal agenda.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.780]   Psychology isn't built on getting my way.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.860]   It is about getting to know the other.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:14.100]   Am I listening to what He's saying on His terms or am I restricting Him to only answer
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.740]   to my worries and my questions?
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.460]   I've been putting burdens on my Bible reading.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.700]   I put on the burden of wanting to get something out of reading the Bible.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:30.660]   I put on the burden of forcing myself to understand every single detail and I put on the burden
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:36.820]   that it depends on me to like reading the Bible and if I don't, I fail.
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:44.460]   But all God wants for us is to be with Him, is to sit by His feet, empty-handed, and just
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:51.380]   ask God to speak to us, to challenge us, to surrender to what He wants to do with our
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.380]   time.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:20:02.520]   Hebrews 4, verse 12 reminds us that the Word of God is alive and active, sharper than any
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.940]   double-edged sword.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.620]   It penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.780]   It judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:18.060]   The power of His Word doesn't depend on my intelligence, my preference or maturity.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:24.980]   It depends on my consistency to be near Him, to give Him the time and space to speak to
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.700]   me through His words.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.660]   Let me say that again.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.940]   It depends on my consistency to be near Him.
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.460]   Give Him the time and the space to speak to me.
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.700]   I remember there was a period of time when I was quite depressed in Australia.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:48.220]   I cut myself off from friends and I would stay in my room all day and had no motivation
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.780]   in life, let alone getting out of bed.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.300]   I did not know what was the matter with me and I just lost all joy.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:00.340]   My friends were obviously worried and tried to get me out of my shell, but I find that
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.860]   stressful and tiring.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.140]   Through those times, I still kept reading the Bible.
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:11.380]   Though my social energy was low, I found the peaceful presence of just reading through
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.540]   the Psalms.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.740]   In a time when I don't even know what happened to me or how I could get out of it, the Word
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:24.540]   seems to be washing and cleansing my heart a little bit every day.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.540]   Then one day as I was reading through the Romans, a verse struck me.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:34.220]   The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.220]   peace.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:40.220]   It was a verse that I've read before, but never has it been highlighted to me that way.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:45.180]   I felt like it was both comforting and disciplining me at the same time.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.060]   I do have the Spirit in me since it was there.
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:53.220]   It will bring me peace and joy, things that I felt was missing in my life.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.580]   I do not need to look for it, bend over my knees to beg for it.
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.820]   It is there for me by the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.820]   But have I been governed by the Holy Spirit?
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:09.940]   Have I been letting Him take hold of me and to guide me in my everyday decision?
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.420]   Or have I been letting myself go, letting my emotions decide what I think my future
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   holds?
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:21.420]   I kept reciting this verse every day in various ways too, writing it out, thinking about it
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.620]   as I go to work, thinking about what I've been governed by and what is governed by it
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.660]   means.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.380]   And soon things started moving.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.780]   As someone says, "It is blessed to meditate on His Word."
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:42.300]   Writing it and thinking about it in my quiet time is great, but having a phrase to meditate
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.980]   on throughout my day helps the Word to take root in my heart.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:53.620]   Meditate on it, ask questions about it, and wrestle with it, create moments for God to
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.980]   speak to me.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.740]   Looking back, I think so much was at work there.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:04.620]   God highlighting the verse to me, the Holy Spirit working in me, and I placed myself
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:10.860]   under the Word of God to believe in it despite feeling sad and rotten.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.180]   The Word of God is alive and active.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.380]   Since then, Bible reading has changed for me because after that period of time, I know
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:25.380]   that God's Word is effective and it can be activated in my life, whether I understand
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:30.420]   how it works or not, or whether I feel that it is working or not, because it is the Holy
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.380]   Spirit who leads me to the truth and opens my mind to understand His Word.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:40.340]   It does not mean that I don't struggle with connecting with His Word at times, but I learn
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.020]   how to journey through it.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:47.420]   To think about it, no author would write himself into the story.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:52.660]   Scrooge does not know about Charles Dickens, nor Juliet knows who Shakespeare is, but our
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.100]   Heavenly Father reveals Himself to us through the Bible.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.980]   How precious is that?
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.660]   Just think about it for a moment.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.160]   God wants us to know Him.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.740]   He wants us to know Him.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.540]   He wants us to know His plans.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.700]   He wants us to know that He loves us and He has a plan for us and He is assuring us that
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.300]   there is a way out in our lives.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.300]   He's not testing our knowledge with the Bible.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.900]   He's showing me through the record of His Word that He is sovereign of us all.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.180]   The Word that He has said still holds power in my life today.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.480]   He spoke and the Word was created.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.540]   He spoke and the Son was created and then the Son is still shining today.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.220]   The season is still changing.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.580]   The Word that He spoke thousands and millions of years ago is still powerful and at work
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.580]   today.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.860]   And so just read about it.
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.620]   Know what He wants for your life and know that this is working for you in your life
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.540]   through the Bible that He's telling us.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.500]   One of my habits of reading the Bible is through journaling.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:01.740]   I know that as I put pen to paper, the fleeting thoughts and feelings were articulated and
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:07.260]   named and I can hand them back to my father for further conversation.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:13.360]   Journaling slowed me down and got me to take each verse as I write seriously.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.000]   Maybe you haven't tried journaling before and you want to give it a go.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.500]   So let me share with you what I do.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.740]   I start by sitting and quieting myself down.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.780]   Maybe I was rushing in the morning to get myself ready.
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.200]   Maybe I was trying to catch the bus in the morning and so my mind would be everywhere.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.940]   But this slowing and calming down and just not thinking about anything really helped
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.940]   me focus.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:43.420]   You know, reading the Bible doesn't have to be, "Okay, it's time to study my English."
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:49.380]   It's about your moment with God and you just need to create that mind, that mindset in
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.420]   your head and go, "Okay, let me slow down.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.300]   I don't have to think about anything.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.500]   I can let my mind go blank and just say, 'Thank you, Jesus.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.180]   You're here.'
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:07.060]   And I pray to ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate the words to me because I know that from the
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.240]   story of Emmaus, reading the Bible is not about me reading it.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:19.540]   It's about the Holy Spirit talking to me, showing me what he wants to tell me today.
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.460]   And so it's not about reading a lot of scriptures.
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.060]   I have to cover the whole Bible in a year, so I have to rush through a chapter every
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.060]   day.
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:34.140]   I just, maybe it's about one or two verses, maybe one psalm, maybe just one psalm.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:40.780]   And as I read, there would be phrases that stuck out to me and I just start writing and
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.260]   copying that verse out.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:50.540]   When I start journaling, I won't wait for the whole idea to develop before I write,
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.000]   but I start writing and let the Holy Spirit lead me.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.260]   One time when I was reading Romans 8.27, it's Romans again, but it's really one of my favorite
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.260]   books.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:07.660]   I was reading Romans 8.27 and I stopped at the phrase, "He who searches my heart," or
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.420]   our hearts, "He who searches our hearts."
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.680]   And because it struck to me, it struck me, right?
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.620]   So I just wrote it on my journal and then I continued to write the following.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.780]   I felt that there are many layers in my heart.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:25.740]   At the top, it holds all the weaknesses and wrongs that I know I have and the thoughts
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.500]   I try to hide, and then the condemnation that follows it.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:37.060]   But underneath that, I see the layers of hurt, the brokenness, and the disappointment.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.740]   God doesn't just stop at the first layer.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.380]   He searches my heart.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.780]   He searches through all those layers.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.740]   He knows that through the weaknesses or the sin that I made at the top, there's this brokenness
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.740]   in me.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.420]   There's this weakness in me.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.020]   And He has compassion for me and He will intercede for me.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:02.220]   I didn't come up with this thought, but it just flows as I copy the phrases.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:07.300]   You'll be surprised by the thought that you actually have when you start writing.
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.700]   It's always refreshing to try different ways to read the Word.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.260]   I do it through journaling.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:19.460]   My friends would listen to it meditatively, and I've also been listening to it while I
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.340]   get my morning ready.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:28.380]   But letting the Word sink into our hearts and thinking about it throughout the day really
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:34.020]   helps to create that space for you to meet with God.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:39.740]   On the welcome table, you can find pamphlets about hearing the Word campaign.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.580]   I don't have it right now.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.700]   I hold on to it the whole morning, and now it's not here.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.020]   But on the welcome table, there's actually this Hearing the Word campaign.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:55.060]   It is a Hong Kong-wide event where they planned a 47-day listening plan for the Book of Matthews.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.300]   You can find more information about it after the service.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.620]   But obviously, it is important to read the Word in our own time.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:07.220]   It is also important to read the Word together in a community.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:13.080]   I love how last Sunday, so many of us gathered together to have lunch together, to connect
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.060]   with each other and to hang out.
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:19.980]   That's the start of building relationships where we get to know each other's names, their
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.540]   likes and dislikes, their hobbies, and all of that.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:29.940]   However, to be a community of faith, it is also important to read and discuss God's Word
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.180]   together.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:36.700]   We share about a week, but also encourage each other through God's Words.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:42.860]   We discuss and grow together in unity as we listen to insights that each group member
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.940]   brings.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:50.020]   We allow the truth from the Scripture to unite us together and encourage each other to be
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.900]   consistent in our reading.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:58.240]   God's Word is the primary way that God has chosen to make Himself known to us.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:05.180]   So even if we want to know God, we cannot give up on God's Word.
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:12.000]   Yes, it might be a struggle, or we need to learn how to encounter God through His Word,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.540]   but God loves revealing Himself to us.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.860]   There's a whole book about Him that we can read about.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:24.420]   He loves to speak to us personally through His Word and making Himself known, just like
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.640]   He did to me when I was struggling.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.400]   So let me end with two encouragement.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.580]   For one, join a community group and learn with others how to read the Word.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:41.140]   And secondly, carve out time to read a short passage of God's Words.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:46.100]   Ask God to reveal Himself to you through His Word.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:52.220]   Pay attention to what stands out, sit with that, and ask God to clarify what He might
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.940]   be saying to you through His Word.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:01.820]   God loves revealing Himself, so if we can be confident that God loves revealing Himself
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:07.940]   so we can be confident when we ask Him in prayer that He will.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:13.420]   I'd love to pray over us, so would you all please stand and the worship team can come
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:18.140]   forward.
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.500]   Maybe you are feeling stagnant in your Bible reading.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:26.900]   Maybe there were a lot of guilt that you carried when you read the Bible and you don't like
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.020]   reading it and there's a lot of burden that you've put on yourself.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.660]   And I'd just like to pray for you.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:38.340]   I'd like to pray for us to meet God afresh, to cast all the burdens on Him and just come
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:42.160]   to enjoy His Word with us together.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.340]   So let us pray.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:51.300]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You that You reveal Yourself to us through Your Word.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.420]   We thank You that we're able to encounter You through the Scriptures that You have given
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.520]   us.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.900]   We also cry out to You that there are times when we don't understand You, when it's been
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.360]   a struggle to read Your Word and there are burdens that comes along with it when I don't
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.180]   understand what You are talking about.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:14.940]   And so we pray, we pray that this is not your heart to have guilt and burden when reading
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:21.540]   Your Word, that through Your power, help us to cast these worries and burden aside and
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.780]   help us to enjoy just spending time with You, reading about You.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.260]   You tell us that You are love.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:34.140]   You tell us that through Your Word that You come to save, that through Your Word that's
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:38.060]   redemption and peace and life.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.700]   And we just want to come to You afresh today.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.780]   We want to seek You through Your Word.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:48.340]   We are not satisfied with how we are reading, but we want to go deeper and read more about
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.060]   who You are.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.940]   And so God, please come and speak to us through Your Word.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.460]   Come and let us encounter You afresh.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:03.420]   We want to know who You really are, who You really, really are.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:08.060]   Thank You God that You love us and You meet us where we are at.
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:15.660]   Thank You God even though we don't understand, You still come up to show us who You are.
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.780]   Thank You that You give us Your Word.
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.860]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.360]   Amen.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:22.860]   Amen.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.280]   (soft music)
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:35.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
