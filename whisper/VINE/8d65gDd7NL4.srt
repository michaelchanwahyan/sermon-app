1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
 it will change us, in Jesus' name, amen.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,180
 - Amen.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,520
 Good morning, everybody.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,360
 - Good morning.

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,860
 - How y'all doing?

6
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,080
 One more.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,240
 (audience laughing)

8
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,880
 That was very convincing.

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,420
 Well, hey, listen, I wanna talk about

10
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,840
 the elephant in the room.

11
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,000
 I cut my hair.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,180
 (audience laughing)

13
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,720
 We've noticed, yeah, we've noticed.

14
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,380
 And in this hair-cutting adventure,

15
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,080
 I've heard some rumors.

16
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,440
 So we're gonna address the rumors today.

17
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,200
 There have been some speculation

18
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,360
 as to why I cut my hair,

19
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,180
 and I wanna make sure, before I dive into God's word,

20
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,980
 that I am up front with you and we clear the air.

21
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,940
 So the first rumor is that it was a wig.

22
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,000
 Y'all, listen, this was real hair.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,280
 It took me four to five years to grow it, okay?

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,980
 I've got pictures of the whole journey.

25
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,160
 They were natural dreads.

26
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,160
 They were beautiful, but I did cut them.

27
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,940
 So they were real, not a wig.

28
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,640
 Second rumor, this one tickles me,

29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,360
 was that I'm going through a midlife crisis, y'all.

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,200
 Come on.

31
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,120
 (audience laughing)

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,840
 I'm younger than Allison, right?

33
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,400
 Like, come on.

34
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,920
 I'm still like vibrant, you know, I'm 34.

35
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,160
 I've got so much left ahead of me.

36
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,400
 So no, I did not cut my hair

37
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,360
 'cause I'm going through a midlife crisis,

38
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,960
 and my hair is real.

39
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,080
 There's not been a wig, but maybe it's not a bad idea

40
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,560
 if I wanna bring it back.

41
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,960
 Okay, Emma says no, whatever.

42
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,100
 Let me explain to you the reason I cut my hair,

43
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,600
 because it's, you know, just so you know,

44
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 'cause I think once we know that,

45
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,720
 we can stop worrying about that

46
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,680
 and actually focus on God's word.

47
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,200
 My wife and I had a daughter back in June this past year,

48
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
 little Remy, and I love being a dad.

49
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,520
 This is my second kid.

50
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,680
 My first one's Elias, the perfect little boy,

51
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,480
 and I have the perfect little girl, Remy.

52
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,480
 And I am about 99,000% convinced

53
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,620
 that my daughter thought my dreads were her father.

54
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,240
 Let me explain this to you.

55
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,560
 So I, you know, her being tiny and a baby,

56
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
 you know, I look over her when I see her,

57
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,520
 and every time I would see her, I would talk to her,

58
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,360
 and I would be animated, and I would smile.

59
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,520
 We'd be making eye contact,

60
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,000
 and I realized at some point

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,680
 that actually I'm making eye contact with her,

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
 but she's looking a little higher.

63
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,960
 And so I would like swing my dreads

64
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,120
 and just watch her eyes go there,

65
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,160
 and I'd like move over here,

66
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,320
 and my dreads were quite long.

67
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,040
 And I realized she loved my dreads.

68
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,200
 She thought her father were these beautiful dreadlocks

69
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,360
 that I had, and I refuse to let anything

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,000
 come between me and my daughter.

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,040
 (audience laughing)

72
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,280
 So I cut 'em, and that's the story.

73
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,960
 So they're gone, they're not coming back.

74
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,600
 Remy now makes, someone asked me this

75
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,960
 after the first service, they're like,

76
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,760
 "But does she actually make eye contact with you?"

77
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,600
 Yes, she does.

78
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,000
 She does make eye contact with me,

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,480
 and all is well again in the Armstrong household.

80
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,160
 But all three of us, my son, my wife, and I

81
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,640
 are adjusting to now being a family of four.

82
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,480
 Having a little girl's been fun.

83
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,240
 My son, he's three years old, and he is learning, man.

84
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,160
 Like, he's never had a sibling before.

85
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,440
 He's the oldest, so he's learning.

86
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,040
 He's trying to figure out, how do I engage?

87
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,320
 He doesn't know, how do I play with a tiny little baby?

88
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,240
 You know, he goes to school,

89
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,360
 he has all the energy in the world,

90
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
 and she's just like, "Man."

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,400
 So it's a bit of a journey for him.

92
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,680
 And I realize that he's been watching me.

93
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,080
 He's been watching me when I didn't realize

94
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,920
 he was watching me.

95
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,880
 He's been learning from me, he's been spying on me.

96
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,600
 A few weeks ago, I walked into our living room,

97
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,280
 and Remy's in her space, and I see, but I hear,

98
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
 Elias over her little Moses basket.

99
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,400
 He's like, "How you doing, my little girl, girl?"

100
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,800
 In a high-pitched voice, and he's got his nose

101
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,880
 next to her nose, and he's tickling her feet,

102
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,520
 and he's doing all my mannerisms.

103
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,800
 And I'm like, "Yo, dude is stealing."

104
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,200
 First of all, "Girl, girl," that's what I say, okay?

105
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,000
 Kayla, my wife, is girl, 'cause she's number one,

106
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,280
 the number one woman in my life, so she's my girl.

107
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
 Remy is my second most important woman in my life,

108
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,360
 girl, girl, so she's my girl, girl.

109
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,560
 Elias doesn't know this, he's three years old,

110
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,200
 but he's referring to her as his girl, girl,

111
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,280
 and I'm just getting a little bit jealous and annoyed

112
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,080
 as a father, like, pray for me, it's a whole thing.

113
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,280
 But I'm realizing he's catching on to the things

114
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,360
 that we are doing, and I'm not trying to be an example,

115
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
 he just happens to learn from me, and he's listening,

116
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,480
 and this is slightly problematic,

117
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,120
 because he's in school now.

118
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,880
 And so, every so often, he takes the things

119
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,760
 that he hears from home to school,

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,680
 so I'm already a pretty holy man, but just know,

121
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,280
 I am being even more holy.

122
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,680
 When I stub my toe, I quote scripture,

123
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,120
 just to make sure that Elias doesn't say anything

124
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,320
 inappropriate, and we get emails at small world.

125
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,520
 But I am now properly recognizing the impact

126
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,120
 and the example that I am to my son.

127
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,040
 You know, my wife and I are both pretty big examples

128
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,920
 for him, he copies what we do, he listens when we know

129
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,960
 he's listening, he listens when we don't know

130
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,920
 he's listening, and he's repeating after us,

131
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,760
 and we're pretty much the biggest example in his life.

132
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,820
 Now, he, one day, will be the biggest example

133
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,840
 in Remy's life, 'cause he's the oldest, right?

134
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,280
 Are there any firstborns here?

135
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,920
 Anyone who's a firstborn and have siblings?

136
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,040
 No, no, only children, just firstborn with siblings, right?

137
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,520
 So I'm the firstborn of three, right?

138
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,400
 My brother Jeremy is great, but not as cool,

139
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,920
 my sister Jasmine's great, but nowhere as cool.

140
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,080
 I'm the oldest, and I remember, growing up,

141
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,160
 my mom, I can still hear it to this day,

142
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,320
 my mom would be like, now be careful what you do,

143
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,120
 because, you know, Jeremy is watching you,

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,400
 he's looking up to you as an example.

145
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,920
 And actually, I didn't share this in the first story,

146
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,960
 but let me just tell you guys what kind of example

147
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,980
 I've been to my brother.

148
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,800
 So I played baseball, I'm five years older,

149
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,200
 just so you know, there's plenty of space.

150
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,840
 I played baseball, my brother played baseball after me.

151
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
 I started playing guitar self-taught,

152
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,760
 Jeremy started playing guitar self-taught.

153
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,920
 I end up marrying a white woman,

154
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,680
 my brother ends up marrying a white,

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,920
 like he literally has copied every single thing.

156
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,240
 I have been such an example, you guys.

157
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,480
 It's been a good time.

158
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,680
 Jeremy, I love you if you ever watch this, for the record.

159
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,240
 But yeah, so the way that he operates,

160
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,280
 my son will have to be an example at some point

161
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,760
 to his sister, Remy.

162
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,680
 And examples are super helpful.

163
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,000
 Having a guide, having someone who has gone ahead of you,

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,760
 who can give you a bit of a template,

165
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,120
 who you can look at when things are challenging,

166
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,400
 is helpful, because times do get challenging for us.

167
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,040
 Things are tricky, and sometimes we don't know the answer,

168
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,520
 and rather than trying to blaze the trail yourself

169
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,480
 to figure it out, we have templates in life.

170
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,600
 We have examples, and as we sit in this second week

171
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,480
 of our forgiveness series, I wanna pretty much premise

172
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,680
 everything on the idea that Jesus

173
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,280
 was perhaps the greatest example

174
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,600
 of what forgiveness looks like.

175
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,320
 If we wanna know what forgiveness looks like,

176
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,280
 perhaps the first step is to be like my son,

177
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,160
 and to watch, to analyze, to examine the things

178
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,880
 that Jesus did to truly be able to understand

179
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,480
 what forgiveness really is.

180
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,600
 It's not something that we've created in the 21st century.

181
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,280
 We don't have to set up how to forgive.

182
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,240
 Actually, we have a pretty good template

183
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,240
 of the most powerful example of forgiveness found in Christ.

184
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,440
 His extreme and radical forgiveness is meant to serve

185
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,920
 as a template to the church

186
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,800
 on how we ought to forgive one another.

187
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,120
 Because forgiveness is a hard thing.

188
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,800
 Forgiveness is not an easy thing.

189
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,920
 I think sometimes we get the misconception

190
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,240
 that we should just like do it.

191
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,040
 It's a pretty challenging thing,

192
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,520
 and especially if we're gonna forgive

193
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,160
 the way Jesus forgave.

194
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,240
 No, we've gotta be able to see him, hear him,

195
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,960
 examine his example to be able to draw strength

196
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,640
 and guidance on how to forgive.

197
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,280
 And perhaps there's no better place

198
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,160
 to really set up the forgiveness of Jesus

199
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,600
 than with the idea of the gospel.

200
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,560
 And the gospel is this,

201
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,280
 that Christ offers forgiveness to all.

202
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,480
 To all people for all things.

203
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,480
 He offers, he's put on the table the chance for forgiveness.

204
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,680
 All who have sinned and have fallen short,

205
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,720
 who's not been enough, who've messed up,

206
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,200
 this forgiveness ends up being the fabric of our salvation.

207
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,680
 Ends up paving the pathway for our reconciliation.

208
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,000
 Ends up being the foundation of our redemption.

209
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,840
 This is powerful forgiveness.

210
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,800
 And based off of what I've heard from this community,

211
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,840
 we need powerful forgiveness.

212
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,560
 When it still hurts and you still carry the hurt

213
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,360
 of the offense that was done to you,

214
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,880
 you need powerful forgiveness.

215
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,520
 When you still have to look the other person in the eye

216
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,240
 who's wronged you painfully or still live in that space,

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,640
 you need powerful forgiveness.

218
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,880
 When the words spoken over you still mark

219
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,880
 and direct you to today, you need a powerful forgiveness.

220
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,600
 Not some simple stuff.

221
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,520
 You need the powerful stuff.

222
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,360
 And luckily enough, we have the example of Jesus

223
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,560
 and the kind of forgiveness he gives us

224
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,040
 as a template of something to look at.

225
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,760
 When your offense cuts deep,

226
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,000
 you have the powerful forgiveness of Jesus as your template.

227
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,440
 So I think it's best that we examine the gospel

228
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,920
 and the tenets of it because it will provide us

229
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,560
 both a blueprint and a guide to give us strength

230
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,000
 in the kind of forgiveness that we're looking into.

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
 So the scriptures are quite clear on what the gospel is,

232
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
 but I think for most Christians,

233
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,920
 we don't use the word gospel every day.

234
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,600
 Like it's just not a conversation piece.

235
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,880
 You don't use the word gospel

236
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,080
 when you're talking to your friends.

237
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,140
 And so probably for that reason,

238
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,960
 we don't properly understand all of what it means.

239
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,920
 So just a way for us to understand the word gospel,

240
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,280
 so I'm not gonna go into all the Greek around it,

241
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,420
 but the simple Greek translation of the word gospel

242
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,640
 is the phrase good news.

243
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,720
 So rather than thinking of the gospel of Jesus

244
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,120
 and it just being kind of like church jargon,

245
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,400
 think the good news of Jesus.

246
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,240
 Something good has happened

247
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,480
 and we are in response to that good news.

248
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,800
 When we say the gospel of Jesus sets you free,

249
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
 it's the good news that he offers that sets you free.

250
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,320
 Gospel is good news.

251
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,840
 For the Christian, it's the gospel proclamation

252
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,000
 and the inauguration of the reality

253
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,880
 of the good news of Jesus.

254
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
 And that good news is pretty clear.

255
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,120
 It's that this, because of Jesus,

256
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,480
 if we now will confess our sins,

257
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,720
 he is faithful and he is just to forgive us of all our sins

258
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
 and he will cleanse us from all our unrighteousness.

259
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,540
 So gospel, the good news is that we can be forgiven,

260
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,040
 that we can stand forgiven and are new.

261
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,240
 And I know a lot of this probably isn't gonna be

262
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,480
 new information for you.

263
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
 I'm not trying to teach you anything new today.

264
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,160
 I'm hoping that as we examine the gospel,

265
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,640
 as we remember what it is that Christ has done for us

266
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,640
 and what it means to live in that gospel,

267
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,200
 that God will just shed light on it for us

268
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,400
 to properly understand what these terms are

269
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,680
 and what it means for us.

270
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,480
 So we're gonna examine it closely today.

271
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,720
 We've been forgiven.

272
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,440
 Our sins are not just canceled, but our debt is paid.

273
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,000
 The scales have been balanced.

274
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,800
 God remains a God of love and of justice simultaneously.

275
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,120
 And we have to understand the elements and the tenets

276
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,280
 of what this gospel means.

277
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,640
 So in one column, you've got sin.

278
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,000
 In the other column, we're gonna talk about

279
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,800
 what exactly Jesus did for us, how he actually forgives us.

280
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,400
 And then lastly, we're gonna look at

281
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,600
 what does all that mean?

282
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,880
 What does that actually offer us?

283
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,600
 What are the benefits of the life, death,

284
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
 and resurrection of Jesus and what he forgives us from?

285
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
 So when we look at sin and we understand sin,

286
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,520
 sin ends up being one of the first major players

287
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,680
 in this concept of our existence.

288
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,160
 And I think for lots of us,

289
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,760
 we don't fully understand what sin is.

290
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,080
 We understand some of the fruit of sin.

291
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,760
 We understand the things you're not supposed to do,

292
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,560
 but what is sin at its core?

293
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,920
 And I think we have to understand it

294
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,560
 if we're gonna have any chance of doing what Paul tells us.

295
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,440
 He says that you should flee from sin.

296
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,620
 Not inch away, not go to where's the line

297
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,120
 of what can I do, what I can't do,

298
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,920
 build my house here and say, oh look, I'm still good.

299
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,640
 No, if you understand sin the way Paul understands sin,

300
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,120
 then you flee from it at all costs.

301
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,840
 You run away from it.

302
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,080
 You avoid it.

303
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,120
 You want to remove it from your life.

304
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,080
 So we're gonna start with understanding what sin is.

305
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,800
 Sin tempts us.

306
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,240
 It entices us.

307
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,960
 Then it traps you and it entangles you.

308
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,720
 It's meant to separate you from God,

309
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,280
 introducing elements like shame and guilt.

310
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,640
 And we've all fallen susceptible to this.

311
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,480
 Scripture would say that all have sinned

312
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,600
 and fallen short of the glory of God.

313
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,240
 We are all guilty of this.

314
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,720
 And when we break down what sin means,

315
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,320
 in our sin we end up doing this concept

316
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,840
 where instead of having God as the one

317
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,600
 in charge of our lives,

318
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,680
 instead of having God as the one

319
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,800
 who rules and reigns over all things,

320
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,560
 we have exchanged that and put ourselves on top of it.

321
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,720
 Any sin you can think of,

322
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,000
 it has been an exchange of God for you.

323
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,640
 We've replaced God.

324
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,440
 In the Garden of Eden, we've chosen for ourselves

325
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,880
 our definition of what good and what evil is

326
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
 versus God's definition.

327
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,600
 And we still see that to this day.

328
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,640
 Like we don't know what truth is anymore.

329
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,000
 Everything is subjective.

330
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,440
 Everything is your own truth.

331
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,560
 Live what you think.

332
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,640
 Live your own peace.

333
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,520
 We've exchanged what God says is good and evil

334
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,840
 for our definition.

335
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,760
 Secondly, we've exchanged the way for human flourishing.

336
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,840
 God has a way.

337
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,480
 He has set up a design so that all would flourish.

338
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,400
 In sin, we have exchanged that method for our own methods.

339
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,200
 A me first method, a me and my clan

340
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,080
 doing whatever I can to help myself get ahead.

341
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,560
 We end up exchanging his method

342
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,200
 and it ends up hurting people,

343
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,440
 ends up hurting his creation.

344
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,840
 It robs us or at least it challenges

345
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,160
 our understanding of our morality.

346
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,640
 It pushes us.

347
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,040
 We exchange God's definitions.

348
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,320
 We exchange his way.

349
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,920
 So boiling down sin is this,

350
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,720
 it's replacing God with ourselves.

351
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,120
 It's an easy way to think of sin.

352
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,760
 Sin is replacing God with ourselves

353
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,320
 where we've decided that we know better.

354
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,800
 That our lives are too precious

355
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,000
 to leave into someone's hands,

356
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,120
 so we take charge.

357
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,680
 We do it our way because you know,

358
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,080
 this is me we're talking about.

359
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,440
 This is me and my family and the things that I need.

360
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,960
 We do whatever we can to make sure we get what we need.

361
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,360
 The basic nature of that is what sin is.

362
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,280
 We've filled ourselves with the things

363
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,720
 that are opposed with God.

364
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,920
 We've labeled somehow these subjective things

365
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,840
 as the ultimate good and we find ourselves

366
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,040
 as a people striving after achievement

367
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,160
 and after earnings and we've labeled that

368
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,240
 as like this is the indicator.

369
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,680
 This is the metric of what a good life looks like.

370
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,800
 If you can earn this much,

371
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,120
 if you can achieve this much,

372
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,520
 if you can live in this house,

373
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,640
 if you could have this car,

374
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,240
 if you could marry this person,

375
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,120
 you've achieved but that is not God's definition

376
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,240
 of what a good life looks like.

377
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,880
 In our sin we've exchanged,

378
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,880
 we've twisted and poisoned the good that is here.

379
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,440
 Trying to preserve ourselves,

380
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,320
 trying to get ahead and the thing that we're aiming for,

381
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,280
 the thing that we're trying to attain

382
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,240
 ends up trapping us.

383
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,000
 Ends up ensnaring us,

384
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,440
 ends up entangling us and we find ourselves

385
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,080
 not actually achieving those things

386
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
 or earning those things.

387
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,720
 We find ourselves ultimately becoming slaves

388
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,800
 to those things where we work and live

389
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,760
 and breathe just to get ahead,

390
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,880
 just to make a certain milestone in a financial setting,

391
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,520
 just to earn a certain amount,

392
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,760
 just to live in a certain place,

393
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,080
 just to be a certain,

394
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,000
 that is not the reason we are here.

395
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,760
 Genesis would tell us that when God created us,

396
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,600
 he had a mandate for humanity.

397
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,880
 He had a purpose in why we would exist.

398
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
 Yes, we bring him glory

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,800
 but he actually had a mission for us.

400
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,400
 He created us and he wanted us

401
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,520
 to have dominion over all creation.

402
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,600
 He had a purpose for us to reflect his image,

403
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,680
 to live as his image bearers,

404
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,320
 his representatives on earth

405
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,560
 and when we fall into sin,

406
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,880
 when we take our lives into our own hand,

407
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,200
 when we define what is good and what's evil for ourselves,

408
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,400
 we end up becoming a slave to ourselves,

409
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,520
 to our desires,

410
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,080
 we end up being controlled by creation

411
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,200
 and what a tragedy.

412
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,960
 What an absolute tragedy.

413
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,800
 We end up morally and spiritually spiraling

414
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,720
 while living in the consequences of poor decisions,

415
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,840
 dethroning God and replacing him with a lesser God

416
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,840
 who is subject to temptation and gives in.

417
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,040
 Scripture would tell us that this is sin

418
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,880
 and sin has a price,

419
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,080
 sin has a consequence.

420
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,880
 There is a response.

421
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,800
 The wages of sin is death, right?

422
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,400
 So when we sin,

423
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,600
 the consequence of that is death

424
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,080
 and our world experiences this now.

425
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,560
 How much sin in the world causes death?

426
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,800
 Causes the decay of humanity,

427
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,600
 causes the decay of our love for our neighbor,

428
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,480
 even our love for ourselves

429
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,120
 and it's not just a physical death

430
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,920
 that we are spiraling into.

431
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,080
 There's also the eternal state

432
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,960
 that God has created us to be in starts to corrode

433
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,400
 and we find ourselves in this cosmic battle

434
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,840
 between God and his goodness

435
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,040
 and our sin and death.

436
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,120
 This is sin.

437
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,600
 This is sin and its impact is so strong

438
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:45,640
 but God and his goodness and his love steps in.

439
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
 He interjects, he intercepts us

440
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,920
 as we are headed for disaster.

441
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,600
 I normally speak pretty exaggerated and poetically

442
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,080
 in just all the things 'cause I'm a musician, right?

443
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,120
 I wanna clarify that what I'm about to say next

444
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,880
 is not something I came up with.

445
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,880
 This is how Scripture defined God intercepting our sin.

446
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,920
 Scripture uses very poetic, very intense and weighty words

447
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,840
 so that we can get a picture, a clear picture

448
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,400
 and understand exactly what he does.

449
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,800
 It says that yet while we were still sinner

450
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,680
 and while we were still away from him,

451
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,800
 while we were still dead in our sin,

452
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,160
 God sent Christ for us.

453
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
 So before we did anything right,

454
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,720
 before you thought, oh, maybe I could be a better person,

455
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,920
 before you reconciled yourself

456
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,480
 and decided to overcome

457
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,840
 whatever the temptation is in your life,

458
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,320
 before you said sorry,

459
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,920
 God has sent Jesus.

460
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,840
 This is where the gospel,

461
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,080
 the good news of Jesus shines into our world

462
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,520
 that despite all being lost and all being broken,

463
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,720
 Christ has come and he's not just come to erase our sins,

464
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,400
 he's come to forgive you and to make you new.

465
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,720
 This is what he's aiming for.

466
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,880
 This is what his forgiveness is meant to look like.

467
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,760
 If we confess our sins, he is faithful.

468
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,120
 Like we sung a minute ago,

469
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,640
 he is faithful and he is just to forgive us of those sins

470
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,040
 and cleanse us of all unrighteousness.

471
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,240
 There is no death.

472
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,720
 There is no death that's too low.

473
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,760
 There is nothing you can do that is so bad

474
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,880
 that Christ's blood cannot cover.

475
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,280
 This is what his forgiveness looks like.

476
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
 You remember when I said that

477
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,800
 Christ offers us a powerful forgiveness?

478
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,960
 This is what I'm talking about.

479
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,480
 That is a powerful forgiveness.

480
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,360
 Don't we wish we knew how to live in a way

481
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,940
 where we could forgive others like that?

482
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,920
 The scripture would tell us that God loves us.

483
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,160
 I think we know that.

484
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,440
 God loves us.

485
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,640
 His forgiveness is not a siloed act.

486
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,800
 It's not just him responding

487
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,240
 to the fact that we made mistakes.

488
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,560
 No, but it tells us that God's forgiveness

489
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
 is an intentional act of love.

490
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,640
 John 3:16, perhaps the most famous passage in scripture,

491
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,480
 says what?

492
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,360
 For God so loved the world

493
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,520
 that he sent his son.

494
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,240
 And through his son, we get the forgiveness of our sins.

495
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,240
 In order to forgive us, God gives us Jesus.

496
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,480
 This is what his love looks like.

497
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,260
 He could have outsourced it.

498
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,880
 You know, in the scripture, you read about

499
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
 Michael the archangel or Gabriel who visits.

500
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,960
 He could have sent one of those guys.

501
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,680
 No, he sends Jesus.

502
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,960
 And just to clarify, Jesus, God, same, okay?

503
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,800
 Same thing.

504
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,360
 Jesus is God in flesh.

505
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,800
 The scripture in Isaiah 7 would call him Emmanuel,

506
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,160
 God with us, God incarnate.

507
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,720
 So God doesn't just send some dude named Jesus.

508
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,960
 God puts on flesh and blood,

509
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,280
 and he comes still being divine, still being God,

510
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,560
 and he walks among broken people.

511
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,280
 He comes and he lives with us, and he understands us.

512
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,040
 He walks our journey.

513
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,280
 God sends Jesus.

514
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,360
 He ultimately sends himself.

515
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,200
 What does that mean?

516
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,280
 It means this, that God made a sacrifice.

517
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,600
 It means that forgiveness isn't just something you do.

518
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,680
 Forgiveness is a sacrifice you make.

519
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,240
 Right, 'cause in Philippians 2,

520
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,920
 Paul writes it super beautifully.

521
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,120
 We understand Paul's other epistles.

522
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,640
 We know that he would tell us to imitate him

523
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
 while he imitates Christ.

524
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,720
 The Christian life is, you can call yourself a Christian,

525
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,160
 is Christ-like, we're meant to imitate Christ.

526
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,320
 But Paul is gonna push this idea significantly further.

527
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,000
 Don't just imitate Christ's actions.

528
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,240
 He's gonna pull us and tell us

529
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,960
 that there's something even bigger,

530
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,160
 probably a precursor to imitating Christ's action

531
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,920
 that we have to understand.

532
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,520
 He would tell us that we need to imitate

533
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,840
 the same mindset as Christ.

534
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,760
 We have to think like Christ.

535
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,240
 We have to see things like Christ.

536
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,380
 We have to take on his mindset,

537
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,520
 how he approached things.

538
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,340
 See, he took on a mindset of deep humility.

539
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,900
 Deep humility.

540
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,760
 Christ-like forgiveness requires this Christ-like humility.

541
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,720
 So I'm not, I'll just read to you what Philippians 2 says

542
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,360
 so that you get why I'm saying this.

543
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,760
 Philippians 2, verses eight.

544
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,280
 Christ, who being in very nature God,

545
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,720
 did not consider equality with God

546
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,040
 something to be used to his own advantage.

547
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,880
 Rather, instead, he made himself nothing.

548
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,720
 Big word there.

549
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,820
 He made himself nothing.

550
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,040
 Taking on the very nature of a servant.

551
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,840
 I use the, I think the ES or the NIV on this.

552
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,760
 I should use the ESV.

553
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,080
 It says he made himself a slave.

554
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,420
 Talk about humility, right?

555
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,400
 Taking on the very nature of a slave,

556
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,280
 being made in human likeness

557
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,400
 and being found in the appearance as a man,

558
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,780
 he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death,

559
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,220
 even death on a cross.

560
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,600
 This is a wild kind of humility.

561
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
 Who lives this way?

562
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,400
 Who steps into such a radical,

563
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,720
 this is what God's Christ-forgiveness looks like.

564
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,200
 This is how he forgives us.

565
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 He is executed through a radical humility.

566
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,360
 So you can't forgive others like Christ forgives

567
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,480
 without this posture of humility.

568
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,720
 Forgiveness is not something you do

569
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,180
 to pat yourself on the back.

570
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,360
 It's not something you do to show the world,

571
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,860
 look, I'm a bigger person, I've forgiven.

572
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,160
 That's not what it's about.

573
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,160
 Consider that forgiveness is rooted in this mindset

574
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,820
 and this framework and this posture of humility.

575
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,500
 And this mark of humility is a bit of a scandal.

576
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,180
 It's pretty challenging

577
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,660
 because I know there's quite a few of us,

578
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,100
 understandably so, who would feel

579
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,880
 that for the offenses done to us,

580
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,940
 our offenders deserve our anger.

581
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,980
 They deserve our bitterness.

582
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,100
 For what has been said to you,

583
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,360
 what has shaped your identity,

584
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,340
 they deserve some frustration.

585
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,760
 For how you've been treated, for how you've been hurt,

586
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,040
 the fact that you're still carrying this wound still

587
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,700
 from a close family loved one, they deserve your anger.

588
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,560
 They deserve our frustration.

589
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,800
 For the way they've said things and treated you

590
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,080
 and hurt you, we feel that others deserve,

591
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,860
 it's only just that they get what's coming to them.

592
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,480
 This is the natural way of thinking,

593
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,240
 but let me flip it on its head

594
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,600
 because scripture uses the word about deserving as well.

595
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,160
 Christ would say that, the Bible would say,

596
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,400
 that we were once children of wrath.

597
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,400
 We were enemies of God, deserving death.

598
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:01,180
 We too deserve the thing.

599
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:07,440
 We deserved death, but while we were still sinners,

600
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,440
 before we said sorry, before we repented,

601
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,280
 forgiveness is offered.

602
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,740
 God sends himself to come and take the place

603
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,300
 of the things that you've done wrong,

604
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,920
 the consequences that you deserve,

605
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,720
 God sends himself to take that on.

606
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,760
 While we were still sinners, before we get our act together,

607
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,360
 God substitutes, he exchanges.

608
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,040
 Now remember, when we defined sin,

609
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,500
 we said that sin was this exchanging

610
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,720
 of who is God in your life,

611
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,960
 from it being God to it being you.

612
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,080
 And in Christ's forgiveness to us,

613
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,320
 there is another exchange.

614
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,800
 It's an exchange of who is guilty.

615
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,040
 See, Christ comes in and you are supposed

616
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,960
 to stand guilty for the things that you've done,

617
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,880
 and his forgiveness offers an exchange,

618
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,080
 where he stands in the place of our wrongdoings,

619
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,440
 our shortcomings, where we failed,

620
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,080
 where we've been on purpose,

621
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,560
 and where we've just not been strong enough

622
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,660
 to do the right thing.

623
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:13,680
 He takes our place, which leads us to our salvation,

624
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,280
 but it's done through the path of the cross

625
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,960
 and the blood of Jesus, which we say,

626
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,440
 if you grew up in church, you've heard something

627
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,040
 about the power of the blood of Jesus.

628
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,560
 Nothing like the blood of Jesus,

629
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,640
 which kind of doesn't make sense,

630
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,040
 because the idea is that the blood

631
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,060
 is supposed to wash you clean,

632
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,200
 but if you put blood on something,

633
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,120
 it doesn't make it clean, it makes it more dirty.

634
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,360
 So I just don't want us to be living in a world

635
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,520
 where we hear Christian jargon,

636
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,280
 we sing about it, but we don't understand it.

637
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,440
 So I'm gonna take a few minutes

638
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,500
 to help us understand a little bit more,

639
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,320
 why do we say his blood makes us clean?

640
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,020
 How does his blood actually clean us?

641
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,920
 What does that even mean?

642
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,240
 Are you still tracking with me?

643
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,400
 We're all here?

644
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,920
 So in the Old Testament, for the price of sin,

645
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,640
 the consequence is death.

646
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,800
 God sets up this, I don't know how you wanna call it,

647
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,680
 a system, a sacrificial system,

648
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,000
 where the place of our sin and the death

649
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 that we had acquired would be passed on to something else.

650
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,340
 Something had to die in place of our sin.

651
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,200
 So the whole sacrificial system exists.

652
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,080
 You hear about people killing goats and sheep

653
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,400
 and two, was it pigeons or turtle doves or whatever it is.

654
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,100
 They had all these animals that they had to kill,

655
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,040
 and the animals had to be clean.

656
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
 They had to be pure, but you really can't tell

657
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,120
 the motives of a chicken, can you?

658
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,680
 That might be a little much.

659
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,880
 So God sets up this system

660
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,240
 where they need to optically be pure.

661
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,960
 That's why they said no animals with blemishes,

662
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,120
 only the clean ones, the ones that were normally young

663
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,080
 and innocent to some extent.

664
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,880
 And these optical purity, when the animal was killed,

665
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,080
 that blood, that sacrifice would take the place

666
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,320
 of the death that was upon us for our sins.

667
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,320
 So they had a whole system around this, right?

668
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,420
 And in that system, you had to offer up certain animals

669
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,640
 for certain sins, but not every animal could cover every sin.

670
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,720
 Not every sin could be covered,

671
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,720
 and at best, what was covered was a temporary cover.

672
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,560
 Because after all, it's a sheep for a human,

673
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,020
 and nowhere is that fair.

674
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,680
 Nowhere is that just or balanced.

675
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,600
 And so God sees this, God knows this, God understands this.

676
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,760
 This is his temporary solution,

677
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,960
 while in the meanwhile, he has his plan,

678
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,160
 and he sends himself, he sends Jesus.

679
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,140
 And we all know that God dies for us, right?

680
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,480
 Jesus dies for our sins, and we're made clean.

681
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,580
 But I wanna look at the controversy of the fact

682
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,680
 that Jesus actually lived for us to be saved, right?

683
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,920
 So it's not just that he needed to die,

684
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,240
 but in order for Jesus to be clean,

685
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,480
 it wasn't about what he looks like.

686
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,640
 It was about the fact that Jesus had to live a life

687
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,960
 of no sin.

688
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,160
 So that's why you'll hear people in the Christian tradition

689
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,640
 talk about how Jesus lived a sinless life.

690
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,680
 If he doesn't live a sinless life,

691
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,560
 his death doesn't mean anything.

692
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,400
 He had to be pure, he had to be clean.

693
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,440
 So Jesus' day in and day out,

694
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,400
 when Jesus was thirsty and hungry in the desert,

695
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,840
 being tempted by Satan,

696
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,400
 do you know why he was saying no?

697
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
 Yes, because he was God,

698
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,640
 but because he was remaining clean and pure

699
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,480
 so that when he would die and be a sacrifice for us,

700
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,480
 our sins, all humanity's sins could be covered.

701
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,600
 In his forgiveness, Jesus' death covers us and frees us.

702
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,920
 But it's also in his forgiveness that he lives for us.

703
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,520
 This blameless life that we get from him

704
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,840
 gives the blood power.

705
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,320
 It gives, and that's why we sing and we celebrate,

706
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,400
 and when we take communion,

707
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,360
 we've got the little tiny cup with juice in it, right?

708
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,800
 It's because the blood of Jesus has done something for us.

709
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,800
 He lived and he died so that we could properly be forgiven,

710
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,960
 so that you are no longer,

711
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,280
 you no longer have to be guilty for the sins that you commit.

712
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,800
 That's the whole exchange here.

713
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,480
 He's stepping in, he's taking the place, he's exchanging,

714
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,060
 and I could go on forever around this,

715
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,860
 but instead I wanna give us a chance to sit and think.

716
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,260
 Normally here at the Vine,

717
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,140
 around, I don't know, the 30-minute mark after the service

718
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,200
 or the hour and 30-minute mark,

719
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,880
 we have a response song,

720
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,300
 and lots of you get up and you sprint out for lunch.

721
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,620
 I get it, it makes sense.

722
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,020
 We're gonna, instead of doing that,

723
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,540
 we're gonna sit in this.

724
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,300
 The sermon's not done, we'll come back in a minute,

725
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,500
 but I want us to sit and we're gonna put up some words

726
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,440
 and we're gonna have a moment,

727
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,660
 and this moment is built around the hymn,

728
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,100
 How Deep the Father's Love for Us,

729
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,560
 which portrays, I think, flawlessly

730
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,480
 what the exchange looks like.

731
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,320
 For Jesus to hang in our place,

732
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,600
 for Jesus to take upon himself

733
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,040
 the wrath of God poured out in our place,

734
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,520
 for Jesus to be the one who stepped in,

735
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,480
 and I know you're gonna be tempted to sing it

736
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,600
 'cause you know the melody,

737
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,220
 but you'll see there's no microphone here,

738
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,880
 there's no singer here, we're not singing right now.

739
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,960
 I just want us to sit.

740
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,900
 'Cause I think sometimes when we sing,

741
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,000
 we sing and we don't think, sometimes.

742
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 I think when we sit and we just read,

743
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,480
 there's a chance that this might hit you differently,

744
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,840
 even if you've been a Christian for 20 years.

745
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,880
 There's a chance that you might see and remember

746
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,060
 and feel just what Jesus did for you.

747
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,080
 So I'm gonna hand it over to Jethro.

748
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,040
 Don't sing, take a minute and sit.

749
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:46,080
 (gentle piano music)

750
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,160
 (gentle piano music)

751
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,240
 (gentle piano music)

752
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,320
 (gentle piano music)

753
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,400
 (gentle piano music)

754
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:15,480
 (gentle piano music)

755
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,560
 (gentle piano music)

756
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:43,640
 (gentle piano music)

757
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,800
 (gentle piano music)

758
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:55,800
 (gentle piano music)

759
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:06,800
 (gentle piano music)

760
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,960
 (gentle piano music)

761
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:31,960
 (gentle piano music)

762
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,120
 (gentle piano music)

763
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:45,120
 (gentle piano music)

764
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:56,120
 (gentle piano music)

765
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,280
 (gentle piano music)

766
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:08,280
 (gentle piano music)

767
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,280
 (gentle piano music)

768
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,200
 - The cross is the most powerful expression

769
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:38,000
 of Christ's forgiveness for you and for me.

770
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,320
 It was a ridiculous display of humility,

771
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,080
 a commitment to love,

772
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,960
 and ridiculous obedience.

773
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,800
 It was our sin, it was our debt that he pays

774
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,160
 with his life and with his blood.

775
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,200
 Christ's unforgiveness is actually,

776
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,800
 or his forgiveness is unfair 'cause it's unearned,

777
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,920
 but it's this beautiful exchange

778
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,440
 where God himself would take upon him

779
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,800
 the consequences of the mistakes we've made.

780
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,240
 I'm preaching this sermon three times,

781
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,480
 but even as I think about it now,

782
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,680
 I don't know, there's just something

783
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,720
 about really sitting in the reality

784
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,400
 that God would do that.

785
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,920
 I think we know it, we do know it,

786
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,720
 but not enough do we sit in it.

787
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,160
 And I'm just thankful.

788
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,160
 I'm just really thankful.

789
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,280
 Beyond what it does for me and all the things

790
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,480
 that might get after it,

791
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,360
 I'm just thankful that his love looks like that,

792
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,520
 that his forgiveness is that powerful.

793
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:01,680
 When we consider the weight of our sin,

794
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,880
 the re-exchange that takes place here,

795
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,160
 the God-sized mistakes that we've made,

796
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,520
 the God complex which we live within,

797
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,360
 when we consider just how deep our sin was and is,

798
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,400
 it gives us a great opportunity to see how much greater

799
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,680
 the forgiveness of God is to cancel the debt,

800
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,400
 to satisfy our debt.

801
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,000
 Then we understand what Christ did for us.

802
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,640
 Then we understand that his forgiveness

803
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,520
 isn't something that you earn.

804
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,600
 You don't behave good enough and now you get forgiven.

805
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,760
 You don't come to church enough and now you're forgiven.

806
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,880
 You don't not say bad words and now you're forgiven.

807
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,080
 No, it's not something you can earn.

808
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,080
 It's something he has given to you of his own accord.

809
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,800
 It's a grace and it's because of that

810
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,640
 that we can boast in no thing, no power, no wisdom,

811
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,680
 no gift, no nothing, nothing we've done,

812
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,080
 but it's a free gift given to all of us.

813
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,960
 It's a ridiculous thing God has done.

814
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,600
 That if we confess our sins, he would be faithful

815
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,960
 and he would be just to forgive us those sins,

816
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,160
 cleanse us of all unrighteousness.

817
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,360
 The gospel is a proclamation of good news.

818
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,480
 This is good news that Jesus is willing

819
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,040
 to forgive all people of all things.

820
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,320
 And when we see that our sins are now forgiven,

821
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,560
 when we see the way in which he forgives us,

822
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,640
 the type of humility that he has to have,

823
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,360
 the kind of sacrifice he's willing to make,

824
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,760
 we have to ask ourselves, what does it produce?

825
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,240
 We are forgiven, what does that actually mean?

826
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,760
 We understand sin, we understand his sacrifice,

827
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,840
 but what does it mean that we are forgiven?

828
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,520
 His forgiveness makes available to us

829
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,520
 a reconciled relationship and it reawakens our spirits

830
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,640
 and it reaffirms our identity into God's family.

831
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,120
 In short, Christ's forgiveness is our salvation.

832
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,120
 When you hear people say, are you saved?

833
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,520
 Well, I was saved on this date.

834
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,040
 This is what we mean by saved.

835
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,080
 His forgiveness leads us to that salvation.

836
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,400
 It is our salvation.

837
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,520
 In our sin, we lived as hostile towards God.

838
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,600
 We lived as enemies towards God,

839
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,320
 but what Jesus's forgiveness does is that it brings you in.

840
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,920
 He doesn't forgive you and say,

841
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,320
 now never come back again, I've forgiven you,

842
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,200
 now just leave.

843
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,280
 No, he forgives and he draws you into himself.

844
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,360
 He makes a channel, a pathway available

845
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,040
 that you can commune and know the heart of God

846
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,200
 to where the most sovereign being,

847
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,720
 the creator of everything will speak to you,

848
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,720
 will inspire you, will talk to you, will comfort you.

849
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,840
 Right, like this is what his forgiveness does for us.

850
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,120
 It's another exchange where,

851
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,720
 and before Christ's forgiveness,

852
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,640
 if God would look upon us, he would see our sin.

853
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
 He would see where we've fallen short

854
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,680
 because of Christ's forgiveness

855
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,120
 and if we will accept that salvation,

856
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,360
 when God looks at you and exchange takes place,

857
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,880
 there is an imparted, Christ puts his righteousness,

858
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,880
 his perfect, flawless living, his sinless, pure life.

859
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,560
 He puts all that he has actually done upon you

860
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,320
 so that when God looks at you, God's not angry.

861
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
 You know that?

862
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,200
 Ask Christians the mistakes you've made.

863
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,280
 When God looks at you, he's not annoyed.

864
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,640
 He's not like, oh, you did it again.

865
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,120
 But I think a lot of us feel that way.

866
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,280
 It probably makes us hesitate to come close to God

867
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,640
 'cause we think he sees us for what we've done

868
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,520
 but the freedom that is found in Christ's forgiveness

869
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,600
 is that he sees you based off of what Jesus has done.

870
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,480
 That's powerful forgiveness.

871
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,040
 His righteousness, Christ's righteousness

872
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,680
 has been imputed towards us.

873
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,720
 Another gift that we get

874
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,760
 is this reawakening of our spirits.

875
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,480
 Right, so God could have forgiven us

876
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,520
 and left us be, okay, he draws us in

877
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,680
 and he now looks at us the way that Christ behaved

878
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,880
 but then he gives us a spirit.

879
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,840
 He gives us his spirit that acts as our counselor,

880
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,440
 as our comforter, as our companion.

881
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,200
 It's the one that helps us understand scripture

882
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,280
 and the word of God.

883
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,360
 He gives us this beautiful gift of himself.

884
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,920
 Like how many times do you forgive someone

885
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,000
 and say, also, I have a gift for you?

886
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,920
 This is not very common, right?

887
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,120
 This is how Christ's forgiveness looks like.

888
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,120
 He draws you in and then he gives you stuff.

889
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,280
 He gives you himself, his spirit,

890
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,720
 not just the breath that we see in Genesis

891
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,600
 where he breathed his spirit and we're alive.

892
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,600
 Now he sends his spirit to forever dwell in us

893
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,680
 and it says that with the spirit of God in us,

894
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,160
 we would be able to do even more than Christ has done.

895
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,840
 Oh, he lived perfect.

896
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,680
 That's just wild, right?

897
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,000
 Like what a gift.

898
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,880
 This is what he gives us in his forgiveness.

899
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,440
 Our spirits are reawakened

900
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,920
 and we end up becoming people who live by the spirit.

901
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,720
 Most of Paul's books would have some section

902
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,760
 in his epistles about living by the spirit,

903
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,960
 being you in the spirit.

904
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,880
 It's because of this idea that Jesus' forgiveness doesn't,

905
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,600
 I think a lot of us think, it wipes the slate clean, right?

906
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,240
 It wipes the sins that we had here, it just wipes it.

907
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,400
 I kinda wish I had a whiteboard, I could show you it.

908
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,840
 He doesn't wipe it, he like throws the board away

909
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,040
 and he gives you a new one.

910
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,160
 It's not about like cleaning it off.

911
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,800
 It's Jesus gives you a new,

912
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,480
 this is why it says that in Galatians,

913
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,480
 the old is gone, the new has come in Christ Jesus.

914
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,360
 He's not trying to clean off how bad your sins are,

915
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,840
 he's giving you something new.

916
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,280
 He's giving you a new life, a new spirit,

917
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,920
 a newness that we can now live in the spirit,

918
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,640
 we can now walk in the spirit,

919
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,480
 we can set our hearts and our eyes

920
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,560
 on things of the spirit.

921
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,160
 He's giving us a new slate, we are made new.

922
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,960
 And the last thing he does,

923
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,520
 which I just think is absolutely wild, genuinely crazy,

924
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,700
 is this idea that he brings us into his family.

925
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,740
 I just can't imagine a scenario

926
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,920
 where you forgive someone of a tremendous debt

927
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,320
 and then after you forgive them, you say,

928
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,320
 also, here's my will, I'm writing your name on it.

929
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,320
 Like, think about this stuff.

930
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,760
 Like, this is the gospel,

931
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,680
 that Jesus not only forgives you of his sin,

932
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,620
 but he brings you into his family.

933
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:51,040
 He says, you used to be sons and daughters of wrath

934
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,800
 and you deserve death, but now you are children of God.

935
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
 First John, where we get our anchor verse,

936
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,440
 we've been reading like three times today,

937
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,240
 in the few verses or the few chapters that are there,

938
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,240
 John refers to us as children 13 times.

939
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,920
 Like, it's really clear that God wants you in the family.

940
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,740
 He doesn't want you thinking, I have to earn this.

941
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,080
 My son doesn't earn my love.

942
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,560
 Remy will never have to earn my love

943
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,280
 because they're my children.

944
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,280
 And if I can love my kids this way,

945
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,760
 how much more will God love you?

946
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,440
 He brings you in.

947
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,460
 Modern day forgiveness is, you say you're sorry,

948
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,240
 maybe I'm a little angry, but whatever,

949
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,180
 I don't have to see you again.

950
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,440
 We forgive and we forget.

951
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,400
 That's not God's playbook.

952
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,120
 This is not how we've been forgiven.

953
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,840
 The forgiveness offered to you is he forgives you

954
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,880
 and he brings you in and he floods you with gifts,

955
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,280
 with his spirit, with an awakening in your spirits

956
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,280
 where you can sense the things of the spirit.

957
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,640
 He puts you on the list.

958
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,440
 You are now a child of God.

959
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,960
 You inherit the goodness and all that God has.

960
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,280
 The power of God resides in you.

961
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,800
 Like, this is why we have to, the crux of the sermon,

962
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,420
 this is why we have to look at Christ's example

963
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,860
 of forgiveness, because this is the only place

964
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,080
 that we see forgiveness that looks like this.

965
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,000
 No other religion, no other culture,

966
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,420
 no other story has a forgiveness that looks like this.

967
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,080
 This is like not even heard of anywhere.

968
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,520
 It's absolutely one of one.

969
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,480
 This is how Christ forgives.

970
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,920
 He brings you into the family.

971
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,720
 He doesn't treat you like family.

972
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,060
 Paul would say he grafts you in.

973
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,720
 You become his children.

974
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,720
 And this is why he would say you must be born

975
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,800
 again, born into the family of God.

976
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,140
 This is, it's so important that we get it.

977
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,000
 The family of God, you are in God's family.

978
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,200
 Stop trying to earn it.

979
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,840
 Don't think you can lose it.

980
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,040
 If you accept his forgiveness,

981
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,160
 if you will walk that path to salvation,

982
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,560
 if you will journey with him, he puts you in the family.

983
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,480
 You don't have to beat yourself up all the time.

984
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,800
 You don't have to worry about your status.

985
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,400
 No, he loves you.

986
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,040
 He loves you.

987
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,120
 He loves us.

988
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,000
 I feel like this sermon,

989
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,480
 and I feel like you probably think the same thing as well,

990
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,480
 could have been boiled down to like a three minute idea.

991
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,480
 'Cause it's just been the same thing

992
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,280
 over and over again about the gospel.

993
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,680
 But ultimately, what it's saying is that

994
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,920
 despite what you've done,

995
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,580
 despite what you're prone to do,

996
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,000
 despite how big the mistakes you made,

997
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,040
 or how terrible the choices you chose to make,

998
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,560
 despite how short you've come up,

999
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,480
 despite the frustrations that you might have caused,

1000
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,800
 God is armed, and I use that word on purpose,

1001
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,440
 he is armed with forgiveness,

1002
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,440
 ready, quick to forgive, slow to anger.

1003
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,080
 This is our God.

1004
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,820
 This is the gospel.

1005
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,040
 This is why we call it good news, right?

1006
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,880
 This is good news, not a clean slate,

1007
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,280
 a new slate, fully new.

1008
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,800
 And I tell you this gospel story

1009
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,480
 because it is of the utmost importance,

1010
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,280
 and we have to remember, we have to remember,

1011
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,360
 in our world we're flooded with so much stuff,

1012
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,040
 we forget, we have to sit and remember

1013
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,760
 what he's actually done for us.

1014
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,120
 What it actually looks like,

1015
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,800
 the fact that it cost him things.

1016
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,200
 And forgiveness won't just be something

1017
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,880
 that we muster up with our strength and we remember this.

1018
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,360
 If we can remember correctly,

1019
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,800
 if we can remember what we've been forgiven from,

1020
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,880
 perhaps it's gonna impact the way that we forgive.

1021
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,960
 And I wanna, before it comes out weird

1022
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,320
 and you think I'm saying something else,

1023
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,720
 I wanna clarify, I'm not saying that

1024
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,160
 if you just trust in Jesus, all of a sudden,

1025
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,560
 the way you are hurt won't hurt no more.

1026
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,880
 I'm not just saying that if you just trust in Jesus,

1027
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,420
 forgiveness becomes easy overnight.

1028
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,320
 That's actually nowhere in the 66 books of scripture.

1029
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,280
 No, forgiveness is hard, and because it's hard,

1030
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,520
 we need a strength that we don't find in ourselves.

1031
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,880
 If you were here for Converse, I just chose a few.

1032
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,800
 We had a prayer station where you got a chance

1033
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,620
 to write the things that you were dealing with

1034
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,000
 when it came to forgiveness, some of the offenses,

1035
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,640
 some of the hurt that you're living with.

1036
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,600
 Forgiveness isn't easy because we've had hurt in our lives.

1037
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,280
 Someone wrote, "I forgive blank for betraying my trust

1038
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,280
 "and my love for you."

1039
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,320
 That causes deep hurt.

1040
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,000
 You can't just will your way or Jesus coat that, right?

1041
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,720
 Someone wrote, "Forgiving myself,

1042
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,520
 "even though I know I'm sinful,

1043
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,880
 "God has already forgiven me,

1044
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,460
 "and I need to quit the shame because I'm a new person."

1045
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,960
 Someone else just wrote, "Forgiveness towards God."

1046
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,600
 Someone wrote, "Forgiving themselves."

1047
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,280
 Two people wrote, "Forgiving themselves."

1048
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,160
 Someone said, "Forgiving my ma and my pa."

1049
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,020
 "I release forgiveness.

1050
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:59,120
 "The things you did hurt, but I know you did your best."

1051
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,920
 Forgiveness, when it's that close, is hard.

1052
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,880
 "Lord, help me let go of the way my in-laws treat me."

1053
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,240
 I know most people make a joke about that,

1054
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,280
 but that will impact your life, right?

1055
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,040
 "My dad, my grandmother, my country,

1056
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,440
 "my old friends, my family."

1057
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,640
 Guys, forgiveness isn't something that a sermon fixes.

1058
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,040
 It's something that Jesus helps us with.

1059
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,760
 So, forgiveness is still gonna be super hard after this.

1060
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:33,120
 So, I do want it to be debunked.

1061
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,120
 I want it to be clear

1062
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,680
 that you don't have to have the strength

1063
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,420
 to forgive on your own.

1064
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,220
 That forgiveness isn't something that you just do,

1065
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,040
 but that forgiveness is actually something

1066
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,520
 that requires supernatural strength.

1067
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,120
 When we still carry the pains of our hurt,

1068
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,420
 we need God's help to forgive.

1069
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,640
 When we still live with the scars of what's been done to us,

1070
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,200
 we need God's help to forgive.

1071
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,360
 In order for us to come close to this

1072
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,640
 forgive your brother 70 times seven concept,

1073
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,860
 we need God's help.

1074
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,200
 And that's what the gospel shows us.

1075
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,740
 So, look, I have two points, super simple.

1076
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,840
 The goal of this sermon is to help you remember.

1077
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,680
 It's to create space for us to remember the gospel,

1078
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,720
 what Jesus has done, and to see it real, real clear.

1079
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,760
 And so, the two things I want you to take with you,

1080
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,640
 I want us to remember so that we know

1081
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,760
 what forgiveness truly looks like, okay?

1082
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,680
 Remember so that you know exactly

1083
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,640
 what you were forgiven from,

1084
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,020
 exactly who forgave you and what that sacrifice cost them.

1085
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:48,420
 Remember so that you can know what forgiveness looks like.

1086
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,960
 The second thing is remember so that we don't,

1087
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,560
 so that we know where to go for our strength.

1088
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,920
 So that we don't go to other places

1089
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,480
 thinking that this person or this,

1090
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,160
 this thing is gonna help me forgive.

1091
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,120
 There's no other forgiveness story out there like this.

1092
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:13,860
 Only in Jesus can you find this kind of forgiveness

1093
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,680
 for yourself and find the strength to lean on him

1094
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,520
 and that spirit in him that is now in you

1095
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,020
 to forgive others of the things that they've done.

1096
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,720
 Forgiveness is important.

1097
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,280
 It's very important to all of our hearts.

1098
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,580
 And so today, I wanna create space for us,

1099
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,500
 not just to stand up and sing,

1100
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,460
 so I'm gonna again ask you not to stand up.

1101
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,000
 You can sing if you want.

1102
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,760
 But we're gonna create space to sit for a minute

1103
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,520
 and just think and just reflect.

1104
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,040
 Because there's some of us here who,

1105
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,640
 if we think about it, if we ask ourselves

1106
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,560
 and we're honest, today's a chance for us to realize

1107
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,440
 it's not about how hard we try to earn God's forgiveness.

1108
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,340
 It requires God's help to forgive others.

1109
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,360
 There are some of us today who this is just a chance

1110
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,120
 to slow down and stop striving.

1111
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,460
 There's some of us today who don't know Jesus.

1112
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,320
 And this is a chance to come in closer

1113
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,640
 and ask him to reveal himself to you.

1114
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,280
 That this gospel, this good news,

1115
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,000
 this is not for all people.

1116
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,800
 It's for those who will confess their sins.

1117
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,800
 There's a condition to believe in him,

1118
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,160
 not believe in yourself.

1119
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,320
 So maybe you're here today,

1120
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,860
 this is your first time hearing the gospel.

1121
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:37,820
 Maybe you're here today and you just need help.

1122
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,360
 He is our ever-present help.

1123
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,680
 That's such a good phrase.

1124
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,740
 Like always present, always available,

1125
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,800
 never taking a nap, never on vacation.

1126
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,600
 He's always present, ever-present help.

1127
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,760
 Maybe today's a chance for you to lean

1128
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,720
 upon that ever-present help.

1129
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,880
 I don't know what kind of work he needs to do,

1130
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,000
 but I'm gonna get off stage,

1131
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,160
 the band's gonna sing that song.

1132
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,000
 Don't get up, don't rush out, guys.

1133
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,840
 Lunch can wait.

1134
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,860
 Sit in this.

1135
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,760
 Ask God, what is he saying?

1136
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,920
 What is he revealing?

1137
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,400
 What is he unearthing?

1138
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,020
 What is he building in you?

1139
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,180
 Let him do a little bit of work in you today.

1140
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,280
 That's why we're here.

1141
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,860
 (gentle music)
