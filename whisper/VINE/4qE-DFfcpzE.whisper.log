[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.380]   When I was in seminary to study to be a pastor, there was a season where I realized that I
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.000]   didn't worship God very much.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.400]   It was actually quite shocking.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.880]   Now, I didn't do that intentionally, and for the longest time I wasn't even aware of it.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.180]   But one day I had an assignment in one of my classes, and the assignment was to jot
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.620]   down key moments of my spiritual journey.
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.120]   And so I sat in my room, I started reflecting on all that God had done, and I started writing.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.900]   And as I was doing that, I was suddenly overcome with a deep sense of awe and gratitude of
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.600]   God's work in my life.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.280]   And as I was looking back, it was amazing to see how God had provided for me, and how
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.540]   He had guided me, and how He blessed me every step of the way.
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.760]   And as I was sitting in that room by myself, tears started filling my eyes, and I started
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.580]   praising God and telling Him how thankful and grateful I was for what He has done in
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.340]   my life.
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:33.440]   Now, this was significant for me because I had been going through a dry season.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.460]   I'm sure you can relate to that.
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.140]   We all go through them sometimes.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.780]   But the Holy Spirit worked through that exercise in the class, and He renewed me, and He gave
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.900]   me the desire to worship God again.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.340]   And it was powerful.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.660]   Now, I don't know about you, but for me, and even to this day, I have different seasons
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.540]   in my life of praising and worshiping God.
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.300]   There's times when I praise God a lot, and where it just flows out of my heart, and where
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.300]   it's very clear as to who God is and what He's doing in my life.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.500]   And then there's other times where there's only praise, it's very sparse, it's far and
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.380]   in between.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.180]   But here's the thing, we always have reason to praise God.
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.340]   Now, maybe we're going through difficult things, but even in those difficult moments, we have
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.580]   reason to praise God.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.580]   Now, perhaps we're not thanking God for the trials or the challenges that we're facing,
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.980]   but nonetheless, God is good, and there's things that we can praise Him for, and He
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.860]   is worthy of our praise.
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.620]   He's worthy of it.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.460]   And so today, as we're coming to this final message in a Summer Psalms series, I want
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.980]   to reflect with you together on where are you on your spiritual journey right now when
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.660]   it comes to praising and worshiping God.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.020]   Are you right now in a season where there's very little praise, and it's been difficult,
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.300]   and it's been hard to praise God?
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.900]   Or are you in a season where the praises are coming easily off your lips?
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.180]   And so we're going to look at Psalm 66, and as we walk through the Psalms, we're going
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.460]   to look at two things.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.420]   One, what does it say about why do we worship God?
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.380]   Why do we do that?
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.580]   And then secondly, how is the Psalm inviting us to renew our desire to worship God again,
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.620]   and perhaps in a deeper and in a new way?
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.540]   So we're going to walk through the Psalm section by section.
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.060]   We're actually going to look at the whole Psalm, and so let's start in verses 1 through
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.060]   4.
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.940]   It says, "Shout for joy to the God of the earth.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.220]   Sing the glory of his name.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.420]   Give to him glorious praise.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.840]   Say to God, 'How awesome are your deeds!
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.500]   So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.060]   All the earth worships you and sings praise to you.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.380]   They sing praise to your name."
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.580]   So our Psalm is a call.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:41.140]   It actually literally calls us to shout our praises to God.
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.580]   And it also tells us about what our praises are supposed to be like.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.460]   They're not supposed to be mediocre.
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:59.420]   They're not supposed to be half-hearted.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.100]   Verse 2 tells us, "Sing the glory of his name.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.460]   Give to him glorious praise."
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.580]   And what that means is our praise needs to match the person that we're worshiping.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.780]   God is, and his works that he does in our lives, they're majestic, they're awesome,
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.860]   they're amazing.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.900]   And so our praise needs to reflect that.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.740]   Just think of a band performing or an orchestra performing.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.560]   If the performance is poor, you know, people are like, "Nah."
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.240]   But if they do an incredible job, you know, we're so moved and we cannot help ourselves
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.860]   to clap and to cheer.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.940]   And if it's appropriate in that setting, we might even cheer, "Encore, encore, encore."
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.700]   We want more because it's so amazing.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:55.380]   Now, in a similar way, our worship and praise needs to match who God is.
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.980]   It's the only appropriate thing.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.460]   God is our creator.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.580]   He's our provider.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.380]   He's the one that loves us, that takes care of us.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.380]   He's also a redeemer.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.940]   Earlier, we celebrated communion.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.100]   We remember what Jesus has done for our sake.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:29.660]   They don't have life on the cross, so we can be forgiven and have new life in him.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:38.780]   So our praise needs to be fitting of who God is.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.660]   But in verse 3, we're actually given a little bit more instruction on what do we actually
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.020]   say in our praise and worship.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.980]   It says, "Say to God, 'How awesome are your deeds!
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.900]   So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you.'"
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:03.660]   We're told that we praise God for his works, for what he does, and we tell God what he
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.660]   does.
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.060]   That's part of our praise.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.620]   We tell God what he has been doing.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:18.500]   So actually, throughout this message series, we've had various pastors praising God, telling
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.380]   you and telling God what he's been doing in our lives.
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:31.260]   You know, how he has met us, how he's provided citizenship and flats and taken care of our
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:38.820]   families, and how he has not put us to shame when we placed our trust in him in deep, difficult
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.980]   circumstances.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:48.860]   So we tell God, we praise you for that, we worship you, we thank you for that.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:55.140]   So we acknowledge and recognize who God is and what he has done in our lives.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.100]   And it flows from that recognition and us seeing what he does.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.380]   Now, a lot of times you lose track of that.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.620]   I think that's what happened to me in seminary.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.180]   I lost track of what God was doing and who he was.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.740]   It's kind of weird when you're studying, right, to be a pastor, and you lose track of that,
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.920]   but it happens.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:23.620]   But the Holy Spirit revealed to me and showed me a new, you know, God's work in my life,
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.260]   which led me into praising him, and I told him what he did.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.020]   In verse 4 it says, "All the earth worships you and sings praises to you.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.460]   They sing praise to your name."
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.940]   Actually, this is a response to verse 1.
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.780]   In verse 1 it says, "Shout for joy to God all the earth."
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:52.980]   And now all the earth has responded, and it gives God worship and praise.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:09:00.260]   That's the only appropriate thing that this world can do.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:10.020]   But the statement actually also involves the worship, the Hebrew word for that involves
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.820]   bowing down with our bodies.
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.300]   It literally means bow before God's majesty.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:21.820]   So with our bodies, we're called, the world is called to acknowledge who God is.
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.180]   And then not only that, we're also meant to sing it with our voices.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:31.260]   So with body and with voice, we worship God with our whole, basically with our whole being.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.260]   That's what that means.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:39.540]   With our whole being, we're meant to worship God with our lives, the lives that we live.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.860]   But there's also a prophetic dimension to that statement in verse 4.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.620]   It says, "All the earth worships you."
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.780]   It means that's for one what should be, but it's not right now.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:58.940]   But one day all the earth will worship God, and that is certain because of who God is.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:06.460]   It's certain because God will accomplish his purposes for this earth.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:12.340]   And if we recall in the New Testament, if you're familiar with that, for one, Revelations,
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:18.500]   the picture is a multicultural, multi-ethnic scene of worship, of the world praising God,
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.980]   people from all tribes, tongues, and nations.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:26.240]   But then in Philippians, in the book, a letter that Paul wrote, it also talks about that
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:32.580]   one day every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.460]   And there will be no denying of that.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.460]   Amen.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:45.040]   And so one of the things that we learn in this passage is we worship God for the works
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.260]   that he does in our lives, and we praise him.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:58.780]   And the book of Psalms, it's the worship and prayer book for the community of faith.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:04.940]   And so we're called to praise and called to remember this thing so that it leads us into
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.940]   worship.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:11.020]   And as we keep going through this, just remember that this is an invitation for us to be refreshed
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:16.000]   and renewed in who God is and how he wants to lead us back into the praise and seeing
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.140]   who he is.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.260]   So right now I want to ask the worship team to come up, and I actually want to ask you
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.260]   all to stand.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:35.880]   And I want to invite you that we give God worship that matches who he is.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.540]   Now that doesn't mean necessarily being loud.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.940]   You can bow within your heart before God.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.900]   So I just want to encourage you to not worry about who's around you and if somebody dances
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:56.100]   or doesn't dance or raises their hand or doesn't, but just come to God right now and just tell
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.700]   him how awesome and how amazing he is.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.700]   So let's do that right now.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:08.400]   Yes, God, we declare that you are worthy of our praise and we pour our praise to you because
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.840]   you are the only one who's worthy of our praise.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.960]   We thank you that you are the creator who has created us.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:23.260]   We thank you that you are the one who cares about every one of us, who watches every step
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:31.240]   that we take and who meets us in times of need and delivers us.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.800]   And Jesus, ultimately we thank you that you have died and yet you have risen again and
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.240]   that in you we have new lives.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.840]   And we praise you for that.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   In your name, Jesus.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.120]   Amen.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:53.740]   Thank you, worship team.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.180]   So let's continue in Psalm 66 verse 5.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.380]   It says, "Come and see what God has done.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.880]   He is awesome in his deeds towards the children of man.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.880]   He turned the sea into dry land.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.540]   They passed through the river on foot.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:17.060]   There did we rejoice in him who rules by his might forever, whose eyes keep watch on the
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.580]   nations.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.180]   Let not the rebellious exalt themselves."
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:30.140]   So now the details of God's awesome work get unpacked in the psalm because God works concretely
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.980]   in our lives.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.260]   You know, this is not just some abstract concept or thing.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.180]   God works personally.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.500]   He works in history and he works individually.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:50.180]   And so now Israel is recalling, the psalmist is recalling this, the biggest event up until
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.780]   this point, which is the Exodus.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.700]   So the story is basically this.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.400]   Israel was enslaved by the Egyptians.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.440]   And God through Moses led his people out of Egypt.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.860]   But then Pharaoh decided to come after them.
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:12.820]   And so as Pharaoh came after them, suddenly the Israelites found themselves stuck between
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.180]   Pharaoh's army and the sea.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.740]   And their situation looked desperate.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.460]   But then we're told in verse 6, "He turned the sea into dry land.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.780]   They passed through the river on foot."
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.660]   God did a miracle.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:37.940]   He delivered his people and freed them from Egyptian oppression.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.100]   Now this is also a very significant statement about who God is.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:48.060]   Because during that time, Pharaoh was actually considered like a semi-god or a god.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:54.660]   And so what this says is that God is the only one who is truly powerful.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.700]   And that no one can stop his purposes and his plans.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:05.100]   And that whatever he has planned for his people will come to pass.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.140]   No one can stop him.
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.460]   And so we can be confident of that too.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:14.500]   That God will unfold his purposes that he has for us in our lives, in our community's
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.220]   lives, in the city's life.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:23.860]   You can be confident because God is creator.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:28.260]   He's the only God.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.700]   So then next, the psalm actually records how the Israelites praised God.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.340]   And at the end of verse 6, it says, "There did we rejoice in him."
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.980]   Again it's this act that leads us people right in that moment.
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.980]   You have to rejoice.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.420]   You cannot ignore what just has happened.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.980]   And so they praised God.
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.460]   And actually if you read Exodus 15, it talks about that.
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.860]   They sang a new song.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.940]   So they made up a new song with new lyrics about what just had happened.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:08.820]   And it praised and it honored God.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:17.380]   And through this recounting of the Exodus story, we can see God's work in our lives.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:24.140]   And it encourages the community as it recalls this event and recalls also new events.
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:29.060]   And we're also encouraged when we do that, when we recall how God has been working in
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.660]   our community's lives.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:37.620]   Today before the 9 a.m. service, 915 service, and also before the 11 a.m. service, I heard
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.820]   two testimonies of God working.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:46.960]   One of them had to do with God, somebody whose employer has not allowed them to come back
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.340]   to church.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.220]   And we were asked to pray for that.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.220]   And so we've been praying for that.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.860]   And today that person was here.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:01.700]   So praise God.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.740]   And the second thing was another person that shared with me.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.660]   Last week we prayed for something, and this week the prayer was answered.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.260]   I'm not going to go into detail.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.540]   But we need to share these testimonies with each other because God is at work.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.900]   He's at work in our life.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.740]   He's at work in this community.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.820]   We often lose sight of that.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.820]   We forget that.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:26.860]   Or we struggle to trust that God is powerful to act and to move.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.060]   And we need to say, "Come and see."
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.660]   This is an invitation.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.340]   Our worship is an invitation every week to come and see who God is, to remember who He
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.300]   is.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:46.980]   As I was preparing this, I was reminded of a friend a long time ago.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.820]   He enjoyed my worship music.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.160]   He didn't have a Christian background, a German friend.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:59.100]   And so I ended up, this is like in the Stone Ages, I ended up giving him some CDs.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.980]   And they were, at that time, they were really precious.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:09.060]   But it was a come and see thing because the songs, they sang about, you know, God and
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.760]   who He is and what He has done.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.100]   So I invited my friend to come and see who God is.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.780]   And in a very long process, not just through that, he ended up becoming a Christian.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.660]   But that's a long story for another time.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:29.060]   So the second thing that we learn about praise is when we praise God for His rescuing work
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:35.060]   in our lives, it is an invitation for others to come and see and learn about the awesome
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:42.340]   works of God and to join in and praise Him.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.700]   So let's continue with the third stanza of the psalm.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.380]   Continuing in verse 8, it says, "Bless our God, O peoples!
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:56.300]   Let the sound of His praise be heard, who has kept our soul among the living and has
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.220]   not let our feet slip.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.780]   For you, O God, have tested us.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.060]   You have tried us as silver is tried.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.760]   You brought us into the net.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.980]   You laid a crushing burden on our heads and our backs.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.740]   You let men ride over our heads.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.780]   You went through fire and through water.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:19.300]   Yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance."
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:27.060]   So in verses 8 through 9, we're called to praise God because He protects us and guides
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.060]   us.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.060]   He preserves us and keeps us.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:39.500]   And I love this, that it talks about, "and has not let our feet slip."
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:47.580]   Every step that we take, God watches over us and He does not let our feet slip.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.380]   He preserves us.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.700]   Now if you look at that, initially you might think, "Oh, then the whole Christian life
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.700]   is easy.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.940]   You know, it's never a hard time."
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.420]   But that's why there's that second part that shows that it's not always easy.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.820]   And the life of the people of God has not always been easy.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:12.060]   And the life of Israel, which there's some references to their suffering and their trials,
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.420]   it hasn't been easy.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.460]   But let's look at verse 10, which unpacks that a little bit.
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.780]   It says, "For you, O God, have tested us.
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.660]   You have tried us as silver is tried."
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:29.140]   So there's times in our lives where things are going well and it's easy to praise and
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.620]   to worship God.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.900]   And maybe we're quoting scriptures and doing all sorts of things.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.000]   But then there's times when you go through trials.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.420]   What about then?
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:46.100]   Do we praise God during difficult times?
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.100]   So here it says those trials are also times of testing.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.020]   They're times of testing of what's in us.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.420]   What kind of faith do we have?
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:01.220]   So it's this metaphor of, "Tried us as silver is tried."
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:06.700]   So it talks about smelting and you heat up the silver and all the impurities and the
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.300]   dross comes out.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.140]   It's revealed through that heating up process.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.420]   And just our trials are that way.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.380]   They reveal what's in us.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:21.980]   And they bring out the impurities, maybe some sinfulness in our lives, but maybe also where
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.780]   we hold on to things, where we place our trust in other things.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:31.260]   Maybe we trust in our money, maybe we trust in our health, maybe we trust in our position.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.660]   But in those trials, we realize they don't deliver.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.660]   They don't deliver.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.080]   It's only God who delivers.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.800]   And so these times of trial, they expose those things in us.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.960]   And God uses that to strengthen and to deepen our faith.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.880]   And He also does that to strengthen our character, to work His character into our lives, that
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.920]   we reflect His character more.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:05.280]   Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty confident that for me, times of trials have
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.280]   been, I mean, they have been very difficult and painful, but they've also been the times
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:16.560]   where I've learned in the deepest way who God is.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.400]   And because of what I've gone through and because of things you've gone through, we
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.760]   are more confident now when things come up, because we know who God is, because He has
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:31.000]   met us in difficult times and we can face them, because through those trials, God has
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.680]   strengthened our faith.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:46.320]   So, the psalmist recalls these trials, and he actually goes into detail of them.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.520]   He says in verse 11 and 12, "You brought us into the net.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.940]   You laid a crushing burn on our backs.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.360]   You let men ride over our heads.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.880]   We went through fire and through water."
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.440]   So these are all metaphors of things that Israel went through.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.720]   They were hunted, like somebody hunts animals with a net.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.000]   They went through forced labor.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.880]   Their country was run over by other armies.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:21.040]   And then they also had to escape fires and waters.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.360]   So they have gone through trials.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   They have known it.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.920]   They have known them.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:32.240]   But then the end of verse 12 tells us, "Yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance."
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.120]   But God has met the people of God.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.520]   He has kept their foot from slipping.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.480]   Yes, those times, those trials, they have not been easy.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.200]   And they've been very painful, even just as you see in those metaphors.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.020]   But God has brought them out to a place of abundance.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.720]   He has not abandoned them, and neither does God abandon us.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:02.640]   He also brings us out into places where we can flourish, and places of blessing.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:10.160]   And for me, throughout the Summer Psalms message series, I was so encouraged by the stories
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:17.000]   shared by Pastor Carla, Pastor Promise, Pastor John.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.280]   You know, the testimonies of how God had cared for their family, had provided for them when
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:29.480]   they couldn't do it out of their own strength.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:36.560]   So God takes us through these trials, but He's with us, and He preserves us, and He
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.240]   does bring us to places of flourishing and of His goodness.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.120]   So the third thing that we learn about praising God is that we praise God for His work, both
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.920]   in our suffering, but also in our abundance.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.100]   And we praise God that He is always with us, and He doesn't leave us.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.880]   He's with us every step of the way.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.000]   So then let's look at the final two standards of the Psalm.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.600]   In verse 13, we'll continue.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.400]   It says, "I will come into your house with burnt offerings.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.360]   I will perform my vows to you, that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.280]   I was in trouble.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:22.680]   I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals with the smoke of the sacrifice of
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.760]   rams.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.360]   I will make an offering of bulls and goats."
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.880]   Now, what's this about?
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:37.200]   Put very simply, here's a person that found themselves in difficult circumstances, and
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:43.380]   they told God, "God, if you help me, if you deliver me, I promise you I will bring you
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.960]   worship through burnt offerings.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.480]   I will go in your temple and praise you."
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:57.800]   And this has now happened, so this person's on their way to do that.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.400]   And then afterwards, that person shares a testimony.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   So let's look at that.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:07.480]   Verse 16, it says, "Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what He has
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.920]   done for my soul.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:15.180]   I cried to Him with my mouth, and high praise was on my tongue.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:22.140]   If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.120]   But truly God has listened.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.740]   He has attended to the voice of my prayer.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:35.740]   Blessed be God, because He has not rejected my prayer or removed His steadfast love from
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:41.360]   me."
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.540]   And I love this.
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:49.580]   The individual, the person, you know, he has experienced God's deliverance, and he's like,
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.580]   "Come and hear!
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.940]   I have to tell you about it.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.940]   Come, everybody, get together.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.580]   Let me share with you what God has done."
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.420]   And so he calls them together, and it's a very, he shares very simply.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:06.260]   It doesn't always have to be this fancy, long story.
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:14.340]   The testimony is, "I cried out to God, and God heard my prayer."
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.960]   So God, He works through testimonies of the community, and we need to actually share when
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.220]   we experience God working in our lives, when we experience God answering our prayers, we
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.660]   need to share that, because God wants to encourage each other.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.980]   He wants to encourage us, and He also wants to lead us in praising God.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:38.140]   I remember, again, through this sermon series, I mean, I was praising God for what He had
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:44.580]   done in my colleagues' life, and it was amazing.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:51.100]   So even you sharing your testimony, your story of how God has worked, you know, God can use
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:56.740]   that to encourage others, but also lead them into praising God and renew their worship
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.340]   of who God is, because we lose constantly track of who God is.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:07.200]   We're like the sheep that always gets lost.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.960]   But I want to touch on two things.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:16.540]   The first one is simply the act of coming to God and entrusting to Him what's going
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:22.900]   on and praying and asking Him to provide, that actually is also part of our worship,
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.980]   because we're acknowledging that God is able to help.
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.040]   And we might not even be that confident in that.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:34.420]   Maybe we just have very little faith, but God can work with very little faith.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.060]   You know, and that honors God when we take that step.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:42.540]   So for some of us here today, maybe this is the step for you that you need to take.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.940]   Maybe you've kept things to yourself, but actually God is inviting you to come and bring
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.260]   that to Him, and that is your worship.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:54.920]   Trust and trust Him with what's been going on in your life and your heart.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.940]   The second thing is verse 18.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.260]   It says, "If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened."
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:08.860]   Now, I don't know about you, but I don't use the word iniquity very much.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.420]   Do you use that in everyday conversation?
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.420]   No?
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.540]   It's like, "Hey, how's your iniquity?
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.540]   How's that been going?"
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.540]   What does that mean?
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:25.620]   Well, that phrase means basically finding pleasure in our sin and not wanting to let
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.380]   go of it and delighting in it.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:36.940]   And it's basically a heart that is not repentant, that doesn't want to repent, that just loves
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.680]   whatever that thing is that we're clinging to, that sin, it just loves it too much and
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.820]   takes pleasure in it.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:53.340]   And so if we cling to sin, we cannot cling to God if we just keep holding on to that
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.180]   and delighting in that.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:00.560]   And so here we learn that whether we're committed to God actually impacts the effectiveness
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.380]   of our prayer.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:11.100]   If we're not committed to God, you know, we don't have any ground to expect God to answer
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.100]   our prayers.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:18.860]   Now, God in His grace, I think a lot of time does, but we don't stand on any ground to
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.380]   expect Him to answer our prayers.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:25.140]   He answers the prayer of His people, those who are committed to Him, who are faithful
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.140]   to Him.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.340]   And this is not about perfection, just a trajectory.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:34.780]   You know, if you're committed to honoring God and that's the path you're on, like we
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.700]   still a lot of times don't do it, but nonetheless, that's the journey we're on.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.700]   But if you're delighting in your sin, you're on a totally different path, like if you don't
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.920]   even want to let go.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:50.400]   And so God answers the prayer of His people, those who trust Him and who walk with Him.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.580]   And so the psalmist then encourages us with that.
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:58.980]   And so perhaps for some of us today, maybe that's the thing that God wants to speak to
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:04.140]   us where we need to let go of something that we've been holding on to, something that we've
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:11.740]   been treasuring in our heart, but that God is asking us to repent of and to let go.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:17.580]   So if that's you, I want to encourage you to do that.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:22.540]   And when we do that, that also is an act of our worship, of acknowledging that God is
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:28.180]   worthy of us giving ourselves to Him.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:37.660]   And then at the end, there's a testimony of an answered prayer and an affirmation of God's
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:41.700]   steadfast love.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.180]   God is committed to us.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.180]   He loves us.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.540]   And He wants us to know His love.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.400]   He wants to show it to us.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:53.460]   It's a covenantal love into His people, and He wants to make that known.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:58.420]   Because the person that experienced God's love when He declares that love, that he has
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:03.140]   experienced God's love.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:07.980]   So the first thing that we learn about praising God is that we praise God through our personal
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.880]   testimonies of His provision.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:16.020]   And it blesses others, it encourages others, it speaks of God's love for us, and encourages
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:20.820]   us to do that as well, to come to God in prayer and experience for ourself what God is able
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.420]   to do.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:30.140]   So let me summarize some of the highlights that I've shared so far about why we worship.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:36.540]   First we praise God for His awesome works, because God does awesome and amazing works
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:41.060]   in our lives.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.700]   And the only appropriate response is to give Him praise.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:50.140]   And then second, we praise God so that others can come and see who God is, and that they
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:54.740]   can be encouraged, and that they can get to know God.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:02.460]   And then third, we praise God also what He does, how He brings us through times of trial.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:09.140]   You know that He's with us every step of the way, that He doesn't let our feet slip, and
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:18.740]   that He brings us out of the trial onto solid ground, into a place of abundance.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:26.420]   And finally, we praise God and encourage others through our personal testimonies.
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:32.140]   Now this psalm is given, you know, to the community, as I mentioned earlier, it's part
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.060]   of the prayer book, the worship book of Israel.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:39.460]   And it's really meant to make ourselves reflect on God's goodness in our lives, just like
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:44.180]   He's been good in Israel's life and in this individual's life.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.020]   A lot of times we don't even notice what God has been doing in our own lives, in our own
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.020]   community's lives.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:54.100]   So this is an invitation today for us to reflect on God's goodness.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.300]   And it also calls us to praise God.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:01.980]   So it's also a call for us to give God that praise that He deserves.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:07.420]   And for me, the sense for today as I was praying over the message was really that God wants
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.100]   to renew our worship.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.620]   You know, a lot of us have been going through dry seasons.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:19.340]   There's been maybe even an absence of experience of God's presence.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:24.780]   And God wants to renew that and He wants to restore that and He wants to refresh us.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:30.580]   As I was praying, I had an image of a display of a phone.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:34.140]   And on that phone, you know, you have the battery thing, and the battery was empty.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:39.500]   And I had a sense that this was a lot of us, our batteries are empty.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.220]   And that God wants to restore and refresh us as we come and give Him the praise with
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.220]   our lives.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:52.620]   He wants to recharge us, strengthen our faith, give us hope.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:59.260]   So earlier I mentioned that during my seminary time, there was a time where I didn't worship
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.260]   God very much.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:06.700]   And perhaps you, like me, are right now walking through a season where you've lost a sense
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:14.380]   of awareness of God's goodness, God's awesomeness.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:19.080]   And this dry season, you know, who knows what the reason is.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.500]   Maybe it's because of difficult things you're experiencing, or the city is experiencing,
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.100]   this world is experiencing.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:31.440]   Maybe it's because you've got distracted, you're focusing on something else.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:42.220]   But whatever the reason is, God is inviting us anew to turn our eyes to Him and to remember
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:48.840]   His goodness in our lives, all the amazing things that He has done, maybe even show something
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.140]   new we haven't noticed before.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:36:00.560]   And He's inviting us to humble ourselves and allow the Holy Spirit to lead us in this refreshing
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.420]   and this renewing.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:07.580]   So right now I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:16.420]   And I want to invite you to close your eyes right now and to actually have a heart-to-heart
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.900]   moment with God.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:23.340]   You know, if you've been going through a difficult time, you know, just bring whatever's going
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.980]   on to God that honors Him, that's worship to Him.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:30.100]   It gives Him praise when we do that.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:36.840]   If you've been, yeah, just struggling to see God's goodness, maybe just ask God to even
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.880]   show you His goodness.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.560]   But if you do see it, just start giving Him praise for the things you're thankful for,
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:48.560]   and allow the Holy Spirit to lead you and then praise Him.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.880]   Let's do that for a moment, and in about 30 seconds or so I'll say a closing prayer for
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.620]   us and then we'll go into worship.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:06.520]   Tell God the things we're thankful for.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:22.300]   Jesus, You know the space that we're in, where we are on this journey of worshiping and praising
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.300]   You.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:32.740]   I pray right now that You meet every one of us, and that You lead us in what You want
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.980]   us to do.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:40.420]   We thank You that You are the one who loves us, that You are the one who's at work in
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:48.820]   our lives, who changes our lives, who gives us hope when everything seems hopeless.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:53.940]   We thank You that, yeah, You love us perfectly and that You are faithful.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:59.900]   Maybe others are unfaithful, but You are always faithful to us and we praise You for that.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:05.500]   And so I pray that as we pour out our thanksgiving to You right now, Holy Spirit, I pray that
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:12.820]   You start refreshing and renewing us and recharging us, that You give us a sense, O Holy Spirit,
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:20.980]   of Your presence and what You're doing, that You would strengthen our faith so that we
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:25.380]   can move forward in what You have for us.
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.140]   So we thank You and we praise You and we worship You.
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.340]   I pray this in Your name, Jesus.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:30.780]   Amen.
