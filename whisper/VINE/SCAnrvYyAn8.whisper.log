[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Hey, as you sit down, why don't you turn around and say hi to someone. Say, "Hey, nice to meet you. It's great to have you here."
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   Oh, so good.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.420]   We are so good.
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.480]   Well, welcome to the Vine. I am so glad you're here.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.560]   My name is Andrew. I'm one of the pastors here, and we are so glad you're a part of this, that you're at our 11 o'clock.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.340]   We got 9, 15, 11, and 2 here on a Sunday.
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.680]   And I could not be more excited for what I want to share with you today.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.300]   You know, I think there's been a really growing sense of God's presence in his house. Amen.
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.880]   And I think when God moves by his Spirit,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180]   it's because he has something important that he wants to bring to us.
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.400]   That there is life and life abundant in the reality of God's presence, in the Spirit that's at work with us,
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.720]   and in what he does through us, and in particular what he does through a flip chart.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.440]   Can we have a round of applause for the amazing
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.420]   work that Ben and the team do, and the anointing presence of a flip chart.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.500]   I want to take you today into
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.620]   what I consider actually the most important and fundamental posture
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.960]   that I think God has for the global church right now.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.640]   And I think is the number one characteristic of
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.680]   human life that he wants you to learn in, grow in, and manifest
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.480]   as you live here in Hong Kong in this
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.940]   incredibly important hour of Hong Kong's history.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.960]   I want to say this, there has never been a more important time to be a Christian in Hong Kong than right now.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.080]   That did not get the reaction I was hoping for.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.340]   I'm gonna say it one more time.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.600]   There has never been a more important time to be a believer of Jesus in Hong Kong than right now.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.820]   You are still here.
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.380]   You did not move to Singapore.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.180]   I am so glad that you are still here, because there's work to be done. Amen.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.660]   Like honestly, there's never more an exciting time for the gospel to be at work in our city.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.660]   But I also know this, that unless we manifest this certain characteristic in us that I'm gonna talk about today,
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.820]   I think we're gonna fail to move in the spirit that I think God has for us in our city in this hour.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.620]   I mean, let's be honest.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.780]   The last three years have been brutal here.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.180]   The last three years have been tough.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.420]   I mean, we've all been through it. The social unrest and all of that did, and creating divisions, not just in our society,
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.780]   but in our families.
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.820]   The government policies and processes in response to that, whether we agreed with or we didn't.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.100]   A deadly virus that seek to bring us all down, and
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.500]   government restrictions and policies that we've either agreed with or we haven't agreed with.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.140]   Feelings of frustration and anger.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.020]   Feelings of wondering whether we should move to Singapore.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.260]   Feelings of the fact that a lot of our friends did actually move to Singapore, and it's really annoying.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.140]   The fact that we're wrestling with fear and anxiety and doubt and confusion,
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.060]   that we wish this would all be over.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.580]   The reality that we're still wearing masks when everybody else in the world is like, "What's a mask?"
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.500]   Are you with me?
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.060]   And as I've experienced all of this alongside of you in the last three years and stuff,
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.740]   I've been able to step back a little bit and notice something that I think is such a fascinating phenomenon in human beings.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.740]   I think it's really interesting to look at the ways in which human beings respond to calamity,
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.780]   respond to adversity.
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.180]   In the last three years, we've all experienced it globally, and I think, and I'm kind of generalizing a little bit here,
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:52.140]   but I think largely you can separate humanity into two camps in terms of how we've responded to the issues of the last three years.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.900]   In the one camp, I would call the majority camp, where the majority of us sit.
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.140]   And in this camp, we've experienced the calamity, we've experienced all the things that have happened,
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.460]   and it's overwhelmed us, and it's hurt us, and we've been lost at sea, and we've struggled to find roots in it,
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.860]   and we've asked the big questions, the big questions of God, the big questions of ourselves.
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.260]   We've wondered, "Should we stay or should we go?"
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.180]   We felt the fear, and the anxiety, and the pain that's gone alongside of it.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.020]   And if we're honest with ourselves, it's worn us down, and we come in on a Sunday, and we're exhausted,
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.740]   and we just need something to pick us up because it's completely blown us away.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:38.940]   And then there's a minority group of people in the world who have experienced the same exact circumstances,
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.700]   who have felt the exact same fears, and anxieties, and depression, and anger,
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.900]   who perhaps even still are still feeling the exact pains, and anxieties, and anger.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.860]   And yet these people have seemed to flourish in this time, have actually become more alive.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.300]   This group of people seem to actually be more creative than they've ever been,
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.660]   have a perception of the future that is more exciting than it's ever been.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.940]   And you look at these two camps, the majority that are saying, "Oh, woe is me,"
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.940]   and the minority who's saying, "I gotta get out there, and I've got to do new things,
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.260]   and create new things, and create new business, create stuff that's happening in this world,
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.300]   because now in crisis there is great opportunity."
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.340]   And you see these two things, and here's the scary thing for me.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.500]   I think of these two things, if you were to look at the church,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.060]   if you were to look at the church in Hong Kong, and the church around the world,
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.700]   I would put it to you that Christians are more in the majority camp than they are in the minority camp.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.100]   I mean, if we're honest with ourselves, I think we're more overwhelmed than we are overcoming.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.660]   I think if we're really honest with ourselves, if I was honest with you,
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.860]   I've sat in that majority camp for a long time.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.580]   And something about that should wrestle something in us.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.340]   Something about that should actually disrupt something in us.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.300]   How is it that us who have a relationship with Jesus,
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.500]   the name that is above every name as we've just passionately sung,
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.180]   can realize that when adversity comes, we find ourselves more siding with the majority people?
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.300]   And I think actually, and I want to say this,
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.220]   I think actually that's having an impact on how people view church.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.540]   I think even for us Christians, church has become more and more in the last year or so,
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.460]   the place that we come to in need of desperate respite.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.300]   The place that we come to in desperate need of actually experiencing something.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.020]   The place that we come to out of a weary and tired week,
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.820]   where we fall in across the threshold of the church.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.020]   And we're like, for 90 minutes, we can stuff all of our problems,
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.620]   all of our anxieties of the world, the big, nasty, horrible world out there.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.740]   And church has become for us a place of refuge and respite.
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.020]   And we need it for our healing.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.940]   And if I don't have my church, I'm going to die.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.060]   And I see all that.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.940]   And I want you to hear this.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.060]   God has used the church like that for over 2000 years.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.540]   I don't want you to hear me wrong here.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.220]   Church is an amazing place of respite and release.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.300]   Church is a place that you can come to when you're feeling exhausted and tired and weary.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.100]   And it's a place where you can receive healing and transformation.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.900]   In fact, if that's how you're feeling in the room right now,
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.100]   I want you to know, or even online, you're in a safe place.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.940]   You're here in the place where the Holy Spirit moves to take weary and tired people
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.100]   and help them to find their feet again, so they can go back out into the world.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.860]   Here at the Vine, that's been a part of our DNA for 27 years.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.980]   God has always called us as a church to be like a hospital.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.700]   To walk with broken, hurting people.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.580]   People who don't know whether they can survive another day.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.780]   Our passion is to come alongside of you and walk with you in your pain and your hurt.
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.460]   That's absolutely who we are.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.740]   But I also feel it's important to say this.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.540]   That the body of Christ is not just a place that you go to,
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.100]   to find respite and a safe haven from the nasty troubles of life.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.100]   The church should also be a place where you go to,
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.300]   to be strengthened to overcome the troubles of life.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.540]   The church should also be a place where when you come in there,
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.420]   there is such a sense of God's presence in you,
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.220]   that when you leave here, you don't leave here just going like,
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.340]   "Oh no, I've got to face a whole nother horrible week out there."
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.300]   But you leave here going, "That's where I'm supposed to be."
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.580]   That that place out there is actually the thing that brings me alive.
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.460]   And I come in on a Sunday for 90 minutes to connect with people,
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.140]   to share the passion of what we're doing.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.700]   But actually this isn't life, that is life.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.940]   This isn't the hope of the world.
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.300]   The hope of the world is out there.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.140]   The Spirit is at work in my city.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.700]   He's in work in my neighborhood, in my workplace, in my school.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.740]   And I get to carry his light in that very place.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:49.500]   I mean, could you imagine a church where we don't just bandage each other's wounds,
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.660]   as important as that is, but we actually stoke each other's fire.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.820]   That we actually come around each other and say, "Your life matters."
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.500]   That you have a value, that you contribute something to this world.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.700]   You're an image of God, unlike any other image.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.180]   My passion for you as a pastor, I have dedicated and I will dedicate myself
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.900]   to walking with you in the worst moments of your life.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.260]   I will walk with you when your world falls apart.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.380]   I've been doing it now for 15 years here at the Vine.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.980]   What a privilege it is to walk with you when things are really tough,
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.700]   when adversity is on you, when you're overwhelmed.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:30.220]   But I will also make this commitment that I will dedicate myself to also challenging you.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.260]   To also speaking truth into you.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.580]   To also actually stretching you.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.780]   To also asking you to choose the hard path.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.300]   To actually challenging you to have the courage to live a life
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.540]   that will require you to have courage.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.420]   I'm the sort of person who wants to get around you and say,
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.940]   "Actually, the way you're living right now, I can see a different future for you.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.540]   I can see something else in you."
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.420]   And I believe the Holy Spirit is moving and working and shaping in you.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.700]   In other words, I have a passion for you to be in the minority camp.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.980]   For you to be men and women of faith.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.500]   That no matter what adversity comes, what hardship comes,
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.820]   no matter what might befall your life, you may still feel overwhelmed.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.620]   You may still feel the fear and feel the anxiety.
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.540]   But you feel also something else rising up inside of you.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.740]   And you say, "Because of Christ Jesus, this is not going to be the end of me."
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:29.420]   "Because of Christ Jesus, I'm able to overcome whatever calamity might be coming against me."
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:35.020]   "That we might see the church shift from the majority culture to the minority culture."
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.380]   "And be a place where everybody else in the culture looks to it and says,
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:43.660]   'They're experiencing the same suffering that we're experiencing, and yet they're alive. Why?'"
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.420]   Is it just me that's excited about this?
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.180]   Come on, church.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.260]   I'm sweaty already.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.020]   I've only just begun.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.740]   That was my intro.
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:59.980]   So, if that all's true, here's the million dollar question, right?
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.340]   The million dollar question is this.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.780]   What secret ingredients is there in the human life
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:10.380]   that can enable us to shift from that majority culture of being overwhelmed and stressed and
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:16.540]   anxious into the minority culture that despite feeling that way, I still find myself flourishing?
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.100]   What's the secret ingredients?
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:26.140]   Well, over the last 50 years, sociologists, psychiatrists, those that are cultural commentators,
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.860]   they've actually found that there is a singular characteristic of humanity.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:36.780]   That those who have this characteristic are able to overcome adversity far greater than
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.580]   those that do not.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.380]   You want to know what it is?
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.060]   Resilience.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.700]   It's the word resilience.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.500]   Now, resilience was originally a word that was coined by engineers.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:53.580]   It was a word that they decided to use to describe a certain material that when you
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:58.700]   get this material, if you try to bend it and twist it all out of its shape, it will eventually
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.140]   bounce back to its old original form.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.260]   So, there are these materials in the world where you can take environments and twist
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.620]   and change that material and try to get it to fit something else.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.620]   But as soon as the environment lifts off it or the pressure lifts off it, that material
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.500]   will bounce itself back to being originally how it was created to be in the first place.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:25.260]   And over the last 20 years or so, psychologists and therapists and researchers have begun
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.140]   to take that word that was started in the engineering world and apply it to human behavior.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.060]   And saying there are some human beings that no matter what environment might come against
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.900]   them, no matter how that environment might try to twist them and shape them and change
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:43.180]   them and cause them to move to Singapore, there's another group of people that are
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:48.780]   able to find themselves rooted in life and are able, no matter the shaping of society,
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.700]   to bounce back to originally how they were created to be.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.660]   That's resilience.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:00.300]   And if there's one thing that I think the church in Hong Kong needs in this hour, in
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.340]   this time of history, it is resilience.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.580]   In fact, you should be thinking to yourself, "If I want to actually be the strongest person
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.940]   that I can be, if I can live the best life that I can be, if I'm going to dedicate
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.820]   myself to being the most inspiring and creative that God can enable me to be, well then I
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.780]   better be investing in strengthening resilience in my life."
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.660]   And the lucky thing for us as Christians is that the Bible is filled with stories about
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.060]   men and women experiencing resilience.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.940]   Now the word resilience, because it's a modern day word, is not found in Scripture, but the
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:40.780]   idea of this bouncing back to how we were originally created to be is filled in the
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.380]   pages of the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.700]   I want to read one particular passage that I'm so super excited about that I've been
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.740]   actually sitting in for a long period of time in the last number of months.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.460]   Is everybody okay?
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.820]   Are you still here?
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.260]   Are you ready?
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.380]   We're opening God's Word.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.260]   You must be excited.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.460]   This is Proverbs 24 verse 16.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:11.580]   It says this, "For though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again.
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.820]   But the wicked are brought down when calamity strikes."
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.460]   Let me read this again.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.780]   "For though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again.
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.780]   But the wicked are brought down when calamity strikes."
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.980]   I love the Proverbs.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.220]   Now when you read the Proverbs, you have to have an interpretive tool and technique.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.300]   And that is you have to understand the assumptions that sit behind each Proverb.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.140]   Because on the Proverbs there's a surface thing, but there's something much deeper that
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.180]   sits behind it.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.660]   The surface thing here is this wonderful idea that the righteous are able to rise again.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.860]   Can I have an amen?
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.580]   I mean that preaches, and I'm going to be preaching that in just a few moments.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.620]   Don't you worry.
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.660]   I mean it's amazing to think that we as the righteous people get to rise again.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:58.300]   But there's an assumption that first of all sits behind that, that actually this Proverb
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:58.940]   is all about.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.420]   And the assumption is this, the righteous will fall.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.700]   Oh, we don't like to preach about that one so much.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.300]   "We will rise again" preaches much better than "we will fall."
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.500]   But I love the fact that the Scriptures don't shy away from the reality of human experience.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.820]   It says here the righteous in the Old Testament understanding, what that means is those of
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.860]   us who are in right relationship with God, right relationship with the law, in right
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.780]   standing with Him, we will fall.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.780]   We will fail.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.060]   We will stumble.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.340]   We'll get it wrong.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.700]   We'll make mistakes.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.900]   We'll suffer.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.660]   It will be overwhelming for us.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.140]   The Proverb writer is telling us.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.860]   And this actually grates against everything we think, because we actually think that the
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.460]   very posture of the unrighteous is that they fail.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:52.620]   We think it's the unrighteous who fall and suffer, and that it's the righteous who actually
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.220]   experience great things in life.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.620]   We think that if we're Christians, we're living in the blessing of God.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.740]   And if we live in the blessing of God, everything's going to be kumbaya.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.580]   And the writer here is trying to help us to understand that the world is a little bit
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.860]   different to that.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:15.660]   Whether you're righteous or you're unrighteous, you're going to experience the same thing.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.100]   Oh, man, that's not a positive message.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.060]   But here's the challenge for us.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:27.340]   The challenge is, is that I think for many of us, this actually begins to create and
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.700]   stir in us something that we really need to sit with.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.380]   Notice that he says here, not only are they going to fall, but he says you're going to
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.060]   fall seven times.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.980]   Now, whenever the Old Testament mentions seven, you should take note of it.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.740]   Seven is a very important word in Hebrew.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.580]   It's a very important word in their culture.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.300]   It means basically perfection, but it also means infinity.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:53.020]   So if the writer wasn't hard enough on you, he's being even harder now.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.540]   Because he's saying, not only are you going to fail once in your life, you're going to
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.820]   fail for infinity.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.980]   In other words, you're going to fail and then fail and then fail, and then it's going to
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.380]   suck.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.820]   And then you're going to fail some more.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.860]   And then after that, you're going to make a mistake and you're going to fail again.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.860]   And he's basically saying not seven times.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.380]   He's using this as an expression of saying, here's what it's like for the righteous.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.740]   We're always struggling.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.860]   We're always failing.
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:20.700]   It always seems like we're losing, which is really an interesting thought.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.260]   Because if that's the reality, here's the question I've got.
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.740]   Why should we even be righteous if we're going to fall?
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.300]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.220]   I mean, why should I even be righteous if it's true that I'm going to fall?
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.540]   That's a great question.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:42.220]   It's a question that actually sits under a really faulty theological framework.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:48.860]   That I would actually say that the majority of us in this room, myself included, so often
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.940]   struggle with and causes a huge amount of spiritual anxiety in our lives.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.860]   I want to break this down for you.
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.100]   I want to show you what the proverb writer is trying to say.
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.700]   Is this helping anyone so far?
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.140]   I'm about to use the flip chart.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.100]   It's about to get deep.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.980]   I'm starting with this.
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.620]   Okay.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.860]   There is this thing called good faith.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.500]   And what we think under this faulty theological framework is that if we have good faith, then
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.180]   we're going to have an easy life.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.940]   Come on, church.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.740]   Don't be shy.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:21.980]   And we think that if we have bad faith or no faith perhaps at all, then that's going
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.300]   to equal a hard life.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.020]   Now when I point it out as basic as that, you're probably sitting there going, "I don't
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.500]   believe that.
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.220]   That's not me.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.180]   I don't really believe that."
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.460]   But let me ask you something very important.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.700]   The last time the world fell out from under you, did you wonder where God was?
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.940]   Did you wonder why you as a Christian was suffering so much?
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.420]   Have you ever asked the question when things are going great in your life, do you think
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.660]   it's because you were going to church regularly?
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.660]   "Oh, I started to go to church again and I found the person that I fell in love with."
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.480]   "Oh no."
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.500]   Many of you are like, "That hasn't happened to me yet.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.220]   That's like a suffering I'm going through right now."
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.900]   It's interesting.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.660]   We might look at it like this and say, "No, Andrew, that's not the theological framework
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:08.220]   I have."
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.700]   But when we begin to dig into how we respond in adversity, we can go, "Hmm."
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.740]   And the problem with writers writing this and the reason why it doesn't sit with us
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.740]   is because we do have this environment and it does create spiritual stress.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.860]   Because when something wrong happens in our lives, we immediately begin to blame our relationship
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.460]   with God or we blame God himself.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:33.500]   And when something goes great in our lives, we immediately think it's because of our great
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.060]   relationship with God or because God has blessed us.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.380]   God wants to bless you, absolutely.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:45.180]   But if your theological foundations are as flimsy as this, you're going to have a lot
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.180]   of spiritual anxiety in your life.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.020]   And so the writer in Proverbs writes to the church and he says, "You've got to understand
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.540]   that this is not true.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.180]   That this actually is not the way the world works."
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:01.020]   In other words, the righteous are going to have exactly the same set of circumstances
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.220]   as the unrighteous.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:07.180]   Just because you are righteous doesn't mean that you're going to have a different set
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.500]   of circumstances to everybody else.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:14.540]   The joy of the Christian life is not that you get separate circumstances.
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.820]   The joy of the Christian life is that you're a different you in the same set of circumstances
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.620]   as everybody else.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.300]   The joy of the Christian life is that you become a stronger, better, more faithful person
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.020]   in the same experiences as everyone else.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.020]   That's what it means to be Christian.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:36.060]   Not that you're not going to have any problems, but that in the problems you are an overcomer.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.660]   You will rise again.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.620]   Oh, that deserves a clap and I'm freaking sweaty.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.120]   Okay.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.920]   All right.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.140]   So here's what the writer of the Proverbs is saying.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:59.020]   He's saying, "Whether you have good faith or whether you have bad faith, the reality
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.220]   is," guess what?
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.540]   "Life is going to happen to you."
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.820]   The good, the bad, and the ugly is going to happen to you.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.340]   The issue is not whether the circumstances are going to change.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:18.540]   What the writer is saying, the wicked, when they are facing calamity, he says, "They
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.540]   are brought down."
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.860]   He said, "They struggle.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.340]   They find themselves overwhelmed.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.580]   They found themselves not being able to go forward.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.540]   When calamity strikes, the woes of bad faith, the wicked or the unrighteous, they will find
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.580]   themselves brought down."
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.780]   But he says, "Those of good faith," here's what they're going to do.
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.060]   Oh, you just watch.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.380]   They are going to rise again.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.780]   They're going to rise again, not because their circumstances are different, but because
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.860]   there's something in their character.
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.660]   There's something that the Holy Spirit has created in them.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.780]   There is some strength and some assurity to who they are.
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.060]   Oh, they really believe that Jesus is the name above every name.
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:01.020]   And because of that, they find themselves facing the same stuff, but they will rise
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.660]   again.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.740]   May we rise.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.220]   Think about it.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:15.340]   Think about what God could do with a church that didn't hold on to some faulty theological
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:22.620]   thinking, but grounded themselves in the reality that when there is death, there is resurrection.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:28.940]   That when Paul would write to the church and say, "I'm willing to take the dying side,"
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.740]   so you would know the rising side.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:39.100]   So that we would come to understand what it is to sit in the glory of a risen Jesus.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.660]   Oh, man, that's good.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.900]   That's what I want for us.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.740]   That's what I want for you.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:50.060]   I don't want you when calamity strikes to be brought down.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.460]   I want you to rise again.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.020]   And I want you to find the hope of that rising again happening in you.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:02.780]   So the difference between those who have resilience and those that do not is not whether
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:03.820]   they fail or not.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.540]   You will fail.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.820]   The difference between those that have resilience or not is found in the fact that when they
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.700]   fall, they will rise one more time than they fell.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.540]   That's the difference.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.740]   And that's what the scriptures are calling us into.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:23.020]   That's what we're invited into by his power and by his name, that we would find in ourselves
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:23.740]   such resilience.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.420]   And here's the million-dollar question.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:30.060]   "Pastor Andrew, how do we find that resilience in us?
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.660]   Where does it come from?"
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.660]   All right, good question.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.020]   Let me tell you, and you're not going to like this.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.940]   This is really tough.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.300]   It's in the falling.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.980]   It's in the failing.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.740]   It's in the suffering.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.900]   It's in the stumbling.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.340]   It's in the calamity.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:54.620]   And it's in you being overwhelmed that resilience is created within you.
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:58.540]   I mean, I would love to stand here and tell you that actually the way you get resilience
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.420]   is you read this book.
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.420]   I would love to stand here and tell you that there are three easy steps to getting resilience
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:03.980]   in your life.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.660]   I wish I could tell you to study a course or to read a paper.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.940]   And that's magically how God downloads resilience in your life.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.020]   But the only way resilience is formed and shaped in you is as you walk through the valley
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.260]   of the shadow of death, as you go through the things that are overwhelming in your life,
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.300]   and he begins to work by his Holy Spirit a resilience that could not have been there
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.780]   unless you had gone through it in the first place.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:32.140]   And if that is the case, then we should be leaning into this hour of Hong Kong's history
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.180]   like never before.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:38.300]   If that's the case, we should be grateful for all that we've experienced in the last
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.540]   few years, as hard as it's been.
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.700]   We shouldn't be a defeated church.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.460]   We should be a resurrected church.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.380]   Now, here's another interesting thought.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:55.820]   The reality is, if you're anything like me, you actually kind of want an easy life.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.700]   You actually kind of want to just chill out for a bit because it's been really hard.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.940]   Anyone else resonate with that?
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.020]   I mean, it's been really hard the last three years.
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:05.900]   I mean, it's been difficult.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:06.460]   It's been hard.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.420]   It's been painful.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.180]   I mean, I want to just have a break.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.460]   I want to do less.
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.260]   I actually don't want to press in and do more.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.100]   Pastor Andrew, if you understood my life, I need a pina colada in Bali right now.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.940]   That's what I need.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:19.820]   I want to do less.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.180]   I want to touch back.
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.540]   I want to cut down.
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.180]   And I get it.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.060]   I understand it.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:24.940]   But here's the reality.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:30.380]   We're so focused in this life of trying to reduce our stress when I think we should be
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.580]   more focused in this life in trying to increase our resilience.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:39.100]   We spend so much time trying to do less or trying to reduce our anxiety and our stress
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.140]   when actually maybe what we need to do is invest more in resilience.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.060]   We need to actually work ourselves into the things that God is doing and notice what the
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.740]   Spirit of God is doing amongst them.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.620]   And I think this is so important right now because I don't want you to be the second
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.540]   half of Proverbs 24 16.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.540]   I don't want you to be a person that when calamity comes, you're overwhelmed.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:03.180]   Have you ever noticed how calamity doesn't send you an email to warn you that it's coming?
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:08.220]   It's like tomorrow, your life is going to fall apart.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.140]   Just want you to know so you can get prepared, right?
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.580]   Calamities happen to us.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.180]   And so where is the preparation?
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.740]   Because we can't really be prepared because it could happen anytime.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.540]   The preparation comes when the Spirit of God is at work in us.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.700]   And we choose a life where courage is demanded.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.340]   We choose a life where we have to have resilience in order for us to thrive.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.540]   Where we align ourselves to the work that the Holy Spirit is doing in our city.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.580]   I mean, could it be?
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.460]   Think about this church.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:43.260]   Could it be that the very challenging circumstances of the last three years here in Hong Kong
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:50.620]   was actually God's plan to forge the level of resilience that is going to be needed in us
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.340]   for the very real challenges ahead?
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.700]   I mean, think about Hong Kong.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.180]   Think about the church here.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.980]   Think about what the years ahead could be like for us.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.900]   Could it be that there is now a resilience in us that wasn't in there three years ago?
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.860]   Could it be that God's character has shifted and changed something inside of us
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:16.060]   that we might now be able to take our feet and root them in the hope of the gospel like never before?
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.740]   Could it be that the church's time is now?
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.980]   Could it be that there's no greater time to be a Christian in Hong Kong than right now?
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.940]   Interesting thing is this is not the only time in history
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.140]   where God's church has faced the hardest of challenges.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.740]   This is not the only time where things have been overwhelming and difficult for the church.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.860]   In fact, the New Testament is a story of a church overwhelmed.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.260]   It's a story of a church where many people in that church wanted an easier life.
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.580]   They wanted to check out a little bit.
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:50.060]   They didn't want the hardness of having to go in front of a whole empire
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.100]   with a belief that Jesus was the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.980]   And it was difficult to be a Christian in the first century.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.100]   I want to read you just two examples of how this is really important.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.820]   James chapter 1, starting in verse 2, says this.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.580]   "Consider it pure joy."
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.460]   He starts like this.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.820]   "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, when you face trials of many kinds,
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.100]   because you know that the testing of your faith develops."
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:13.740]   Here it is.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.540]   "Perseverance."
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.020]   That's the biblical word for resilience.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:21.660]   "It creates perseverance in us, and perseverance must finish its work
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.460]   so that you might be mature and complete, not lacking in anything."
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.540]   James writes to the church,
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.060]   a church that wants to run in the other direction and move to Singapore.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.860]   And he says, "No!
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.340]   You're going to root yourself in the ground right here and right now."
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.660]   And in fact, I want you to reframe how you think about all the stuff that's happening to you.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:46.300]   I want you to consider it pure joy when you face challenges,
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.820]   because your challenges will test your faith.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.500]   And when it tests your faith,
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.020]   you will be able to discover whether you have strong roots or weak roots.
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.300]   And if you're found having weak roots, then you can do something about it.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.380]   And if you found that you've got strong roots,
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.780]   you can praise God that he's made them in your life.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.260]   And he says, "Out of this, you will become mature."
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.260]   He's like, "I don't want an immature church," James is saying.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:14.540]   "I don't want it so that when every adversity comes along, you crumble and you fall.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.220]   I want a church that's able to rise again.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.940]   I want a church that can persevere.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.620]   I want a church that has great hope."
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.220]   And here's the really, really interesting reflection on that.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:33.260]   See, the very circumstances and experiences that create resilience in us
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:37.340]   are the very circumstances and experience that we as Christians love to avoid.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:42.700]   The great irony of all of this is found in this,
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.260]   that we so often turn to God to actually deliver us
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.620]   from the very circumstances that are required to build resilience in us.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.940]   Have you thought about that?
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:58.860]   We want God to miraculously remove our suffering immediately.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:03.820]   When perhaps that suffering is there for a purpose, as James said.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.820]   That it's there to actually create some perseverance in you.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.780]   And that perseverance might then change something in you.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.020]   And that then might actually be a greater faith, a more mature faith.
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.300]   I love how he says it here, "So you would lack nothing."
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:23.100]   Notice how Paul actually puts it in Romans 5, and he says it just as strongly.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:28.140]   Paul, who knew what it is to suffer and prayed for God to miraculously remove his suffering.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.940]   Remember what happened?
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.980]   God said, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.300]   That man writes this.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.980]   He says, "We also rejoice in our sufferings,
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.940]   because we know that suffering produces perseverance,
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.660]   perseverance, character, character, hope.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.660]   And hope does not disappoint us,
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.260]   because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit,
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.260]   whom He has given to us."
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.340]   He's saying, "Hey church, there's suffering out there in the world.
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.700]   We're all going to experience it.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:00.780]   The question is, are we allowing that suffering to form and shape in us
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:06.300]   a character trait of resilience that will enable us to move into the hope of Christ Jesus
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.340]   in a desperate time and a desperate hour as this?"
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.060]   Paul's basically saying, "Are you willing to suffer?"
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:18.540]   Because great faith is found through great suffering.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.500]   We don't like to think about that.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.900]   But think about it this way.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.900]   Why do you need great faith if there are not great problems to overcome?
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:33.580]   Some of you in this room, you really do want to have great faith,
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.260]   but you don't want to have big problems.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:39.900]   If you're here today and your prayer is, "God, give me great faith,"
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.580]   let me suggest an alternative prayer.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.820]   "God, bring me some problems."
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.220]   That's a weird prayer, isn't it?
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:55.340]   But I think God opens up for us a space to be bold before Him.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.220]   During the fifth wave, I'm going to close with a story.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.060]   During the fifth wave, my wife and I decided that it would be best to
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.500]   get our daughter out of Hong Kong.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.180]   This is right at the high of the fifth wave,
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.300]   and government was making some funny decisions, separating families.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.780]   We thought this was just a bit unsafe for her.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.820]   And so we decided that Chris, who's from New Zealand,
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.940]   would move to New Zealand for a few months, take Mia with her,
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.820]   and they would be nice and safe, and I would remain back here.
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.580]   So they went to New Zealand.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.500]   And when I said goodbye to them at the airport,
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.260]   this immediate thought went through my head,
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.180]   "They're never coming back."
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.740]   This is like, they're Singapore, right?
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.540]   They're moving out of Hong Kong to New Zealand.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.060]   I don't know if you've ever been to New Zealand,
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.340]   but if you want an easy life, that's the place to go to, okay?
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.740]   If you want to check out a life, go to New Zealand.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.780]   You just chill out there, the sheep and everything, it's awesome.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.540]   And my wife, by her very nature,
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:51.820]   this is her happiest day, a book, a glass of wine, and no human beings.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.100]   You give her that, she comes alive.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.380]   She's always said to me, in all the 24 years of our marriage,
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.180]   she said, "Andrew, I just want a small life.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.740]   "I just want a small life."
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.580]   So she's down there in New Zealand, enjoying her small life,
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.620]   chilled out to the max.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.260]   She's sending me photos of them with no masks on,
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.620]   enjoying their life.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:19.420]   I'm back here, thinking that this is a multiverse, alternate reality over there.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.980]   And I knew that I was going to get a phone call at some point from Chris,
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.500]   and she's going to be saying something like,
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.860]   "Well, I've been praying, Andrew.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.220]   "And I feel like the Holy Spirit is suggesting this.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.420]   "And sure enough, after about two months,
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.580]   "I get the phone call and she starts it,
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.700]   "'I've been praying, honey.'
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.540]   "And I sense the Holy Spirit is saying this to me."
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.620]   He said, "Christine, I want you to have a big life."
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:49.260]   Now, I know that's the Holy Spirit,
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.820]   'cause that is the very antithesis of the heart of my wife.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:56.140]   And with tears in her eyes, as we're FaceTiming each other,
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.660]   she's like, "It goes against everything
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.140]   "that I think in my spirit I want,
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.620]   "but I know it is God's Word."
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:10.140]   She said, "Why would I ever settle for anything less?
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.860]   "Than the biggest life God could give me."
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.980]   And I knew at that moment, she was going to come back.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.340]   I want to say this to you.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.220]   Matthew, when he was speaking to his disciples in Matthew 7,
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:22.940]   he said it this way.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.700]   He said, "Wide is the gate, and broad is the path
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.980]   "that leads to destruction, and many enter that way.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.300]   "But small is the gate, and narrow is the path
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.460]   "that leads to life, and only a few find it."
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.780]   Would you be in the few?
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.940]   I want you to rise again.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.860]   I want you to choose the narrow path.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.500]   Do not choose to settle.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.620]   Do not choose to just reduce your stress
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.100]   without increasing your resilience.
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:01.660]   Make it your greatest ambition to live such a courageous life
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.100]   that it will demand resilience in your character.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.540]   You have been created for nothing less
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.260]   than the best of what God has for you.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.820]   And everything you've gone through in the last three years
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.300]   has been his shaping and his moulding
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.540]   because you are made of the material
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.420]   that will bounce back to its original form.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.980]   And because of that, you can stand in this city
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:28.540]   in its desperate hour of need and say, "There is hope."
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.780]   May we rise.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.980]   Amen, amen.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.660]   (congregation applauding)
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.260]   So may we rise as I pray for us now.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.260]   Father, I am so grateful.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.020]   I'm so grateful for each person here,
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.380]   for each person who's a part of this community of faith,
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.860]   whether in this room or online.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.780]   And Father, I wanna pray right now for each one.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.180]   Whether you're comfortable,
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.620]   maybe you could just open your hands again,
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.780]   whether you're here in this room or online in this moment.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.580]   And as you open your hands,
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.660]   you're just coming in that posture before the Lord.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:15.660]   And like I've been saying in this message,
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:20.620]   if you're in a place where you feel overwhelmed and anxious,
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.660]   you're in the right place.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.180]   His church for 2000 years
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.260]   has been a place of healing and ministry.
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.260]   And after the surface,
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.020]   you have great opportunity to come forward
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.940]   and receive prayer from any of our prayer team
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.860]   who would love to stand with you,
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.700]   speak life over you,
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.220]   bandage your wounds in prayer and love on you.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.700]   And if that's you, you're in the right place.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:47.260]   But we've also been seeing in this message
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.460]   that the Holy Spirit is also at work,
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.220]   not just bandaging our wounds,
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.740]   but taking us through the experiences of life
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.180]   so that we might rise again,
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.060]   so that we might find in ourselves the resilience
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.540]   to rise one more time than we fail.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.900]   That no matter how hard things might get,
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.740]   our suffering might produce some perseverance,
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.100]   perseverance, character, character, hope.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.820]   And we know hope will not disappoint
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.420]   as the love of Jesus is poured into us by the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.020]   That we might consider it pure joy
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.540]   that we still live in Hong Kong.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.540]   That our hearts might be turned to our city in this time.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.180]   That we might celebrate the reality
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.300]   that we're still here and that we are rising again.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.900]   Lord, I wanna pray for each one of us.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.140]   Lord, this is not the kind of message
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.300]   where we give three points
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.980]   of how to build resilience this week.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.100]   It's not the kind of message
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.860]   where we recommend a book to read.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.820]   This is the kind of message
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.900]   where there's hard truth and a prophetic call.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.460]   The hard truth that life happens
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.540]   and we have the choice whether we will rise or fall.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.060]   The prophetic call that we would choose life,
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.500]   the narrow path,
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.780]   that we would find the way of Jesus and not shy from it.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.460]   The joy of what it is to be resilient
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.500]   before the work of the enemy in this world.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.900]   That we would find the blood of Christ
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.180]   strengthening our hands for the battles that are before us.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.860]   And like we sang earlier,
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.740]   that our posture in battle is prayer.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:27.180]   And Father, I wanna pray for the resilience
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.780]   that you want for the Vine Church.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.300]   (gentle music)
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.900]   As I was praying for this service and for this message,
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.740]   I saw a picture of a baby in a swaddling clothes.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.740]   You know that time when you wrap a baby up,
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.540]   a toddler really uptight so they can't move,
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.300]   so they can sleep and feel safe.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.980]   And I felt like the Holy Spirit rebuke me
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.500]   and say that, "Andrew, your spirituality
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.820]   "is so often like that since you've emerged from COVID.
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.740]   "You just want me to wrap you up."
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.820]   "Protect you from the big nasty world."
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.060]   But he said, "It's time for me
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.900]   "to unravel the swaddling clothes."
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.380]   Children have to push out eventually
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.140]   from that comfortable environment.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.940]   And they have to fight out and they'll cry
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.460]   and the parents will wish that they could just
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.540]   wrap them back up again in the swaddling clothes.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.500]   But the child needs to develop, it needs to fight,
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.060]   it needs to find its strength, it needs to mature.
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.140]   And I feel like the Holy Spirit is saying that over me
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.060]   and he's saying that over us as a church.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.620]   He said, "The swaddling clothes are done with.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.140]   "It's time to mature."
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.220]   Paul, writing to the church in Corinth said,
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.380]   "Oh, at the beginning I gave you milk,
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.140]   "but now you need meat."
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.100]   And Lord, I pray that each person here
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.540]   would, as James prays,
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:47.100]   would find themselves maturing in you
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.340]   so that they would lack nothing.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.780]   Lord, would we be a church of resilience
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.860]   so that we would be the non-anxious presence
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.180]   that you want us to be in our city?
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.340]   I wonder if you'd just take a moment
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.460]   to continue to receive from him.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.500]   We don't need to rush.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.380]   The team are gonna now lead us in a time of worship,
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.340]   but just keep your hands open and your spirit supple
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.700]   to how the Spirit of God wants to meet you now.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.700]   Wants to meet you now.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.280]   (gentle music)
