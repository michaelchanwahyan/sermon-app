1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Well, I'm really excited we're continuing our series on a different spirit.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 We're looking at Caleb and Joshua, the 12 spies, numbers 13 and 14.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And we've been looking at a bunch of different things over the last few weeks.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 But this week we're talking about what it is to be wholehearted before the Lord.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And I'm so excited because we get to hear from one of our pastors, Pastor Promise today.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 So why don't we put our hands together and invite Promise here.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Promise is looking smarter than I am.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Just want to point that out.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 It's probably because he is a bit smarter than I am.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I want to say hi to mom and dad Armstrong who are tuning in from the US of A.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 It's great to have you guys with us.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I know you're super proud of this young man, but we're super proud of him as well and we're excited.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I've heard his message already. It's an awesome message.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And I know this is going to be a real blessing to you where you're at.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 So would you stretch out your hands and just join me as we pray for Promise.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Father, we thank you for this man. We thank you for Caleb.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We thank you for baby on its way.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Lord, we thank you for all that you're doing through him and through them as a family.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And Lord, as we come to open your word today, Lord, we don't take that lightly.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 The fact that we can gather online in this room, that we have your word that speaks life to us,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 that we can open it and share it and laugh and find joy and yet be challenged and be changed.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Lord, we just thank you for Promise, for his passion, for his scripture,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 and for his heart for these people.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And Lord, we pray for ourselves. You would open our hearts, Lord.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 We want to hear you.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 But Lord, we don't want to just have our ears tickled and have a good sermon,

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 but we actually want to be changed.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And that means when we wake up tomorrow, when we head into our workplaces and our schools

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 and our families and all the places where we have a sphere of influence,

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 that Lord, you would take this word and it would become manifest in us.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And we ask that you would do this by your spirit and we thank you for it.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 In Jesus name.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Everyone says, "Amen."

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Well, good morning, everybody.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 It's pretty odd to be up here without a guitar or a microphone stand or some instrument.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Slightly tempted to go and just pick it up and maybe I'll speak more confidently.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I'm very grateful to be here.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I am Promise Armstrong, as Pastor Angie just explained.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I serve here at the Vine as the Ministry Life Pastor,

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 which means I get the great opportunity to work with our worship team,

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 our production team, and our Sunday services and events team.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And this morning, I get the honor of sharing with you,

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 continuing this series of A Different Spirit.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Over the past few weeks, we've looked at this journey.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 We've looked at what it means to have a different spirit.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 We've looked at the differences in the 12 spies that went out into the land.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 You've got 10 spies who bring back one report

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 and you've got two spies that bring back a different.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And we've been looking and studying that, trying to understand

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 what does it mean to live with a different spirit.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 See, Caleb and Joshua are the ones who have this different spirit.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And in order for us to be the people God has us to be,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 we have to understand this and put it into our lives.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 So the first thing we notice is this,

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 that a different spirit is not a fairy tale spirit.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 It's not this conceptualized thing.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's pretty realistic, actually.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It's a spirit that is capable of seeing giants in the land,

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 obstacles in mountains, yet it's able to focus its eyes

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 and its attention on the grapes.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 We see that a different spirit is like me and it's just like you,

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 as in it also experiences fear.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 It's not immune to it.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 But what makes it different is this,

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 that rather than being a spirit that is intimidated

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 and is formed by fear,

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 a different spirit on the opposite end informs its fear with its faith.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 These are the things that it looks like to be a different spirit.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And for us today in 2021, a year that has been full of complexity,

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 full of anxiety, for us to be the people God has us to be,

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 it will require us to walk and live in that kind of spirit

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 where we are willing to stand up and step out

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 to bring hope and to bring life and to bring truth

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 into the darkest crevices of our society

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 rather than staying just in here,

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 satisfied with just a 90-minute holy huddle.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Last week we learned that a different spirit

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 looks like a repentant spirit,

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 a spirit that is willing to walk closely to God,

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 that's willing to see sin for what it is and not minimize it,

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 but run quickly to the Father's heart.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 All these things help us understand what it means

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 to live within a different spirit,

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 a spirit that can see God, can see the grapes,

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 can see the giants, and chooses where it focuses its attention towards.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 So in the past narrative that we've been looking at,

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 this numbers narrative, what's happened so far is this.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Moses has sent the 12 men into Jericho to look at the land,

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 try and understand what's going on, and to bring back a report.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Ten of them bring back one report,

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 and two of them bring back a different report,

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 which is a bit odd because all 12 of them went to the exact same place.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Interesting how you can all be in the same space,

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 experience the same thing, yet walk away with a different takeaway,

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 sometimes opposing takeaways.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And what it shows me is this,

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 the difference in these spies isn't where their feet had been,

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 but rather where their heart is positioned.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 [audience member exclaims]

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Caleb's heart was positioned after God.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Caleb's heart wanted God.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 So when we look at this Numbers 14, verse 24,

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 we get a clearer understanding.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 God, speaking to Moses, saying these words,

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 "But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 "and follows me wholeheartedly,

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 "I will bring him into the land he went into,

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 "and his descendants will inherit it."

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 See, there's something about Caleb.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 There's something about his spirit

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 that's different than the spirit in the other ten.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And God attributes that to the willingness that Caleb has

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 to follow him fully, to follow just God.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 This is not just an observation of what a different spirit is.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 This is God himself overseeing the entire situation,

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 watching the hearts and the actions of men

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 from Egypt all the way through the Red Sea to the desert,

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 and seeing something in Caleb

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 and identifying it clearly for Moses.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And he's saying that it's this willingness to follow me fully,

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 wholeheartedly, and me alone.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 See, that's the DNA of what a different spirit is.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 It's a spirit that's willing to follow God alone, God fully.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 That's the framework, that's the foundation

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 that we build this different spirit on.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And it's for this reason that Caleb is willing to see things

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 and is able to see things that the others can't see.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 It's for this reason that Caleb is willing

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 to go into a land of giants with confidence

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 where the others are not.

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 This is the heart of a different spirit.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So as we look closer at this verse,

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 we see God's clear satisfaction in Caleb's spirit.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But what we see about the spirit

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 is some really interesting things here.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 It's not necessarily described as a super strong spirit.

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 It's not necessarily described as the best spirit,

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 grade 8 spirit, top of the class spirit,

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 the most financially stable spirit.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Those aren't the attributes that are given.

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 It's not a spirit that you're just born with

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 or you're born without.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Instead, this spirit looks a lot like just following God

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 and following God alone.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Like that's really what this spirit is.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 It's a spirit that chooses to follow after God,

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 putting nothing on the same level as Him,

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 fully devoted, undivided in its attention

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 and loyal to God and God alone.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 It's a spirit that puts nothing on par with God.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 No dreams, no hopes, no aspirations,

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 nothing at the same level of devotion as with God.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It chooses God and it chooses God alone.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 So here's the thing, this is a pretty big definition.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Like that was a lot.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 God alone above everything else,

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 that's not an easy thing to do.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 It's the reason why only Caleb is mentioned here.

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 That's like a 20% rate.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 That's good math.

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But what we see here is that it's not easy.

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 And I don't want to paint a picture of this super easy thing.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 It's something that we all will have to wrestle with,

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 something that we will all have to work hard at.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And in our lives today, some of us might ask the question,

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 is it even possible to put God above everything else in your life?

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Like some of us are good at putting God

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 in a few sections of being number one in our lives,

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 but can we really say He's number one in every area?

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 In every area is God number one.

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 It's a tough pill to swallow.

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 It's a big ask.

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 But I genuinely believe as we sit through this

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 and as we let the Spirit minister to us

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 and understand these concepts

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 and learn to apply these applications,

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I genuinely believe that this will challenge us,

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 but also will change who we are at our core.

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 So let's dig in.

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 To follow God is not just a congregational thing.

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 There is a level of personal decision in following God like this.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 You think about the story.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 These guys technically, you can say they followed God from Egypt

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 through the Red Sea when He parted it,

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and it went up like this and they went through,

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 across the sea, into the desert,

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 at the brink of the Promised Land.

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 They had technically been--

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I mean, He was going and they were following,

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 pillar of cloud and fire,

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 like they were following behind Him.

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 But interestingly enough, this verse says,

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 "But because my servant Caleb,"

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 He identifies Caleb, He separates Caleb,

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 "from the others."

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 So there seems to be a difference in what's happening here.

197
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 See, they were all walking behind God,

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 but they weren't all following Him.

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And there is a difference in that.

200
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 As Susannah mentioned last week,

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 just because we're walking in the same general direction as God

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 does not equate to following Him.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And I think that's why you can see that these spies all go

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 and have the same shared experience,

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 and Caleb's experience is different.

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Caleb was following after God,

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 and the others were walking behind him.

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 See, when we think about that,

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 it should make us wrestle with some questions.

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Well, just, so I'm following behind God,

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 or I'm walking behind God.

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 How do I know?

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 What could I actually be following

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 if I'm walking behind God?

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I'm doing all the right steps.

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Am I actually following God?

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 I think we have to consider some of the thoughts here.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Could we be walking behind God, following something else?

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Could there be something else that has our attention?

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Maybe some end goal or some destination

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 or some method of how we would like to see God work in our lives

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 or how we would like to see God get us from point A to point B.

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Could that be actually what we're following,

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 disguised as following God?

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 See, because what happens here is that

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 these guys follow God until it gets really difficult,

227
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 and then they want to run back to Egypt.

228
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And that's not what a different spirit is.

229
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 A different spirit isn't the spirit that's like,

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 "Yes, I'm following God. Sign me up

231
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 because he's leading me by green pastures, and that's great.

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Oh, I'll still follow God because he's leading me by still waters,

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 and that's great."

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 But then you pump the brakes when God leads you up the mountain

235
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 because, "Oh, there's cliffs, there's rocks, it's cold, it's dangerous."

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Or when he leads you in the valley of the shadow of death,

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 "Oh no, it's dark. We don't know what's going on.

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Our enemies surround us. Maybe not, God. Let me second-guess this."

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Or even worse, into the land he promised to deliver you,

240
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 yet because you see giants,

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 you would rather go back into the bondage he set you out of.

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 See, that's not what a different spirit is.

243
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 But so often we can be tempted to walk in that way.

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 A different spirit will choose to follow God,

245
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 not depending on where he's taking you,

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 but satisfied in knowing God will be there.

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And that's what it was for Caleb.

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 He was satisfied just knowing God is going before us,

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 God will do it, God will be there.

250
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 And that's why he was able to follow the way that he was,

251
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 with all of his heart.

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 See, we often, we sometimes, often, semi-often,

253
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 sing a song at the Vine here,

254
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 which is probably my fault because normally I choose lots of those songs.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 But the song is called "Oceans,"

256
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 and it was really popular back in like 2014.

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 It had this really cool bridge and everyone loved it

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 and people got tattoos of it.

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 It was really neat.

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And the bridge goes on forever and ever and ever

261
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 until everyone stands up and raises their hands and gets into it.

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 But the lyrics of the bridge read this,

263
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 "Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders.

264
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 "Let me walk upon the waters wherever you may call me."

265
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 This is a hard song to live.

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 It's a really catchy song to sing,

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 but it's a hard song to live.

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 But I believe that this song is the echo of Caleb's heart.

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 God, wherever you will call me,

270
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 mountainous, valley, it doesn't matter,

271
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 wherever you will call me, Spirit lead me.

272
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 This is how Caleb lived his life.

273
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And I can't help but think that maybe Caleb must have known

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 something about God that made him throw in all his luck with him.

275
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 There must have been something Caleb saw or experienced.

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 There had to be something in that journey from Egypt to the desert

277
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 where he just learned to trust God

278
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 and was convinced of something in God to where it didn't matter.

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Regardless if there are giants, Caleb would follow.

280
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Regardless if the city that you've promised us is fortified with massive walls,

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Caleb is willing to follow.

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Caleb believed and saw and was convinced of something in God that he saw

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 in no other person, in no other army, in no other people group, in no obstacle.

284
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 There was something that he saw in God.

285
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 See, Caleb saw grapes.

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Caleb saw giants.

287
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 But Caleb followed God.

288
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 So this morning I ask you this, are you convinced God is who he says he is?

289
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Because without that conviction, without being confident in that,

290
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 it's going to be super hard to follow fully, to follow just him,

291
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 to not want to follow him and all these other things as well.

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Are you convinced God is who he says he is?

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Have you seen enough?

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Have you experienced enough to say, "I'm going to throw my luck in with him"?

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Do you trust him to lead you wherever he may call?

296
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 See, it's clear that a different spirit follows God alone,

297
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 but it is also clear that this is a challenge.

298
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It's hard.

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 It feels somewhat out of reach.

300
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And I believe it's because of one little, kind of little, kind of long,

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 but one word in this passage that we read.

302
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So let's pull up the passage again, and it says this in Numbers 14, 24.

303
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 "But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me"--

304
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 One more time.

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 There we go.

306
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 "--wholeheartedly."

307
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 There's our keyword.

308
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 There's the clicker.

309
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 What does that mean?

310
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Obviously it's a big thing.

311
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 It's this concept of a single-minded,

312
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 so single-mindedly with enthusiastic devotion.

313
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 It means fully following.

314
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 It means that all of Caleb's heart belonged with God.

315
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It means he wasn't sharing his heart, half God, half something else.

316
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 There wasn't, like, a roommate situation where God occupied two-thirds

317
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 and something else occupied the other.

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Like, that's not how Caleb's heart works.

319
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 See, the verse doesn't say Caleb followed God with a healthy amount of his heart,

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 as some of us might interpret it as.

321
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 No, it says "wholehearted."

322
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Here's the thing.

323
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Whatever has our heart is what you're going to follow.

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 If it isn't God, if God doesn't wholly have your heart,

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 you're going to follow splintered.

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 You're going to be going two different ways at once.

327
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Whatever has your heart is what you'll follow.

328
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Matthew 6, Jesus echoes this later on in Matthew 6.

329
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 He says, "Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be also."

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 It's important. It's critical we know what occupies our heart,

331
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 what has our heart, what possesses our heart.

332
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And do hear me on this.

333
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I'm not saying that you can't love things with your heart.

334
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 That would be a little odd.

335
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 We should love things.

336
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I have a great wife and I have a son coming in a couple of weeks.

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I'm very excited to meet. I'm going to love him.

338
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 But it doesn't mean that I can't love him if I'm going to be wholehearted.

339
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 That doesn't work. So what does it mean?

340
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 It means that nothing other than God is meant to hold or lead my heart.

341
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 So following means that something has to be a leader.

342
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 God can be the only thing that leads my heart,

343
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 even if I love the things around me.

344
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 What's really fascinating about this wholehearted concept

345
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 is its relationship to Caleb's name.

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I find it very, very fascinating.

347
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 For some of you who know me well, you know that I have been in seminary

348
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 and I just finished a semester of Hebrew II.

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 I liked it so much I took it a second time.

350
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 That's what I tell myself to sleep better at night.

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 But in Hebrew, the word Caleb is actually pronounced "Ka-lev."

352
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It's a combination of two words, "Kal" and "lev."

353
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 So behind me you'll have some beautiful Hebrew.

354
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 In case you need to get a tattoo at some point.

355
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 So "Kal-lev" breaks down to this.

356
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 The first word, "Kal," it's a "kaf" and a "lamet."

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It equals the word "whole" or "all" or "entirely."

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 The second half of the word, "lev,"

359
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 which is a combination of the two Hebrew letters "lamet" and "bet,"

360
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 means "heart."

361
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Follow me here.

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Caleb's name means "wholehearted."

363
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Caleb is the kind of person who is going to do everything wholehearted.

364
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And it's really beautiful because if we had a nice, super poetic version of the Bible,

365
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 I'm convinced it would read like this.

366
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 But because my servant, wholehearted, follows me wholeheartedly,

367
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 we are called to be like that servant, wholehearted,

368
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 and to follow wholeheartedly.

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 See, that is the spirit of Caleb.

370
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 That is the different spirit.

371
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 This wholeheart concept is to follow God with all that we have.

372
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Caleb follows with all of his heart, his whole heart.

373
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Caleb isn't perfect.

374
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 See, it doesn't say that because my servant, Caleb, is perfect.

375
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 No, no, no, he doesn't say that.

376
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 He says because he follows me with his whole heart.

377
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 God is not hung up on perfection.

378
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 This is something we really have to get down.

379
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 God is not looking for your perfection.

380
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 He's caring about your progress and your process.

381
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 He's caring that you're willing to give all.

382
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 See, God is like the one teacher who gives an A for effort.

383
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 I love those teachers.

384
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I really wish my Hebrew professor was one of those teachers.

385
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Unfortunately, he has not been that way.

386
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 But he's like that.

387
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 He's an A for effort kind of guy where whether or not you have every--

388
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 It's like a little drawing, right?

389
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And the kids are asked to color.

390
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 It doesn't matter if you've colored in the lines.

391
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 You have the kid who grabs like six crayons with both hands and his feet

392
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 and is coloring everything all together.

393
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 That's the A for effort.

394
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 That's the whole heart, using all that you have, all that you are to follow God.

395
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 That's what he's asking for.

396
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 He's not asking for you to be perfect.

397
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 So don't allow that to intimidate you from drawing closer.

398
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Whole heart devotion is where God has 100%.

399
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Your heart belongs to him, nothing else.

400
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Caleb's heart belonged to just God.

401
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And you see, because of that, Caleb was willing to follow God into victory

402
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 or into what looked like defeat.

403
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It didn't matter because he was that all or nothing kind of guy.

404
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And it's this wholeness, this wholeheartedness is driven by a love for God.

405
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 See, we fall in the temptation of looking at the word all and saying some

406
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 or feeling some or living out some.

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Actually, we were singing a song just now, "Jesus, It Is You,"

408
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 "All of My Rights, All of My Wrongs."

409
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 It's cool.

410
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 It's hard.

411
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 If we were to be honest with ourselves, most of the times it's some of our rights,

412
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 maybe most of our rights and some of our wrongs, right?

413
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 We have these great Bible verses that we all love that are super influential

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 and have formed and shaped us into the people that we are

415
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 and that we would love to put on like a magnet to put on our fridge

416
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 or on a bumper sticker for our car that actually talks about some of these truths,

417
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 about all.

418
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 But the reality is that sometimes we live it as a some.

419
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 So let me read it to you so you get an understanding of where I'm going.

420
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 "Love the Lord your God with some of your heart, half of your soul,

421
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 part of your mind, a little bit of your strength."

422
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 That's not as tweetable, is it?

423
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 What about this one?

424
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 "Love the Lord with a portion of your heart and in some of your ways,"

425
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 just some, "acknowledge Him and He will make your path straight."

426
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 That doesn't flow off the tongue as well.

427
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 No one really wants that as the verse that they hold on to, right?

428
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Because we're tempted.

429
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 We are tempted to give some.

430
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And the reason that is is because we potentially are holding back something.

431
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 We potentially have reserves.

432
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 God's all or nothing principle is His way of calling out our backup plans.

433
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 So you can't follow God wholeheartedly with reservations.

434
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 You can't follow God wholeheartedly with holding things.

435
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 You can't follow God wholeheartedly with a bunch of backup plans.

436
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 See, that was the thing with the 10 spies.

437
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 The difficulty that they experienced surfaced what was really going on in their hearts.

438
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 It surfaced their reality that they had, "If God doesn't work out,

439
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 we'll just go back to Egypt," because they were real quick to say that.

440
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Like that was like plan B.

441
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 So to follow God, we can't have backup plans.

442
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And what that does is it speaks to the faith and trust we have in God

443
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 to have to follow Him in this way.

444
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 See, to follow God wholeheartedly is a heart that gives God access to all

445
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 because the most beautiful partial hearts will never be enough

446
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 to walk and follow behind God fully.

447
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 The most beautiful partial, the most beautiful part of your heart

448
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 is never going to be enough to follow God fully

449
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 because that actually gives us to a point of either He is your God or He isn't God.

450
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And I don't mean that you don't like Him or you don't take some notes

451
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 or you don't have a Bible or you don't do these good things.

452
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Either He is God, which means He's God of all, or He's not,

453
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 or we're withholding certain things.

454
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I'm well aware that was a really hard thing to hear.

455
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And so I want to spend the next few minutes really bringing us to a way

456
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 of understanding what can we do.

457
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 God's not in heaven beating us over the head for not getting it right.

458
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 That's not who He is.

459
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 That's not His character.

460
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 That's not His heart.

461
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 He's calling us into wholehearted devotion.

462
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And the good news is that He will be satisfied in our efforts.

463
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 The efforts you put forward will be rewarded.

464
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 You don't have to get it perfect.

465
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 It's not about legalism.

466
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 You don't have to check every box of praying 17 times a day

467
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 or memorizing all the scripture.

468
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Like, that's not what it's about.

469
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 But it's about the effort.

470
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And so we're going to spend some time looking at three ways the effort can

471
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 play out and ways that we can take a step, just at least one step closer

472
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 towards giving God our all.

473
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Is that okay?

474
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 All right.

475
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 So the first thing I want us to think about is this.

476
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 We tend not to follow what we don't know.

477
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 I'm aware I use a double negative.

478
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I'm so sorry for any grammar freaks out there.

479
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 We will not follow what we don't know.

480
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Right?

481
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It's just if you don't know somebody, if you don't know what they stand for,

482
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 if you don't know their values, their guiding principles,

483
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 the story behind them, their reputation,

484
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 you probably will not reprioritize your entire life to where they are

485
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 above everything.

486
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 That's just not how we operate.

487
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 We even teach this to our children.

488
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 We have a phrase called "stranger danger."

489
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 You teach your child not to follow some random person that they don't know,

490
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 right, because we want them to be safe.

491
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Babies do this on their own.

492
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Like if you bring -- Pastor Allison has a cute little nine-month-old.

493
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 If you just leave him with me, yeah, little Isaiah is going to scream.

494
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Rightly so.

495
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 He doesn't know me.

496
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 One of my good friends, Denny, he has a two-year-old now,

497
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 but earlier in her life she was just like little Isaiah.

498
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 She didn't know me.

499
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 She didn't know me at all.

500
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 So every time they would leave her with me, they would be like,

501
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 "Here, promise, hold her."

502
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Never turned out well.

503
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 They took her back immediately.

504
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 But it's because she did not know me.

505
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 She did not know me.

506
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I was not familiar.

507
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 But something changed in the past few years.

508
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 As Emmy grew older, we spent more time together.

509
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Our families took trips together.

510
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 We spent Christmas Eve and all these different occasions together.

511
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Emmy started to know me.

512
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Emmy started to really know me to the point where if I showed up at her house

513
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 today, little Emmy would stop what she's doing and would do anything that I'm

514
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 doing in that house.

515
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 If I'm running around and making a mess out of what they had just nicely

516
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 cleaned up, Emmy will do the same.

517
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 If I'm taking things out of the fridge and putting it in the bedroom,

518
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Emmy's going to do the same.

519
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 If I am throwing balls everywhere and playing basketball in the living room,

520
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Emmy is going to follow me and do the exact same thing.

521
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Her parents won't like us, but she will follow me into that.

522
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 But it shows me something.

523
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Emmy knows me.

524
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Now that she's familiar with me, she's willing to follow me,

525
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 how much more when we become familiar with who God is will we be willing to

526
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 follow him?

527
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Let your knowing of God lead to your trusting of God.

528
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 That's my second point.

529
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Let what you know of God lead to how you trust him.

530
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 See, we know he's sovereign.

531
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 We know he's good.

532
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 It's time we learn to trust that he's sovereign and trust that he's good.

533
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 We have to trust that when we follow him and we reach a place of difficulty,

534
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 a challenge, a dark space, a mountain, that he is capable of leading us

535
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 through that.

536
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 We have to trust that even though this year has been absolutely difficult,

537
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 the last few years have been really difficult for every person on the globe,

538
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 that he's aware.

539
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 He knows of the job losses.

540
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 He knows about the relocation.

541
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 He knows about the family members that have fallen sick.

542
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 He's there.

543
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 He's with us.

544
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 And we have to trust that.

545
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 See, God isn't saying, "Oops, 2021 just slipped out of my hands.

546
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Oh, I didn't know that was happening.

547
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Man."

548
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 That's not how he operates.

549
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 But he's with us.

550
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 We have to trust that he is not careless but that he is radically in love with

551
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 every single one of us, knowing every aspect of our lives.

552
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 He's not going to be forgetful.

553
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 He's not going to be unfaithful.

554
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 He's a good shepherd.

555
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And maybe one of the ways we can take this concept and boil it down to a

556
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 practical step is let me challenge you this week, before you start your day,

557
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 before you get on the train and deal with people who you may not like,

558
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 before you open your email and have to become the boss that you are,

559
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 maybe create a moment and verbally say the words, "Jesus,

560
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 I choose to trust you."

561
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Maybe allow yourself to say, "Jesus, I choose to trust you," and see what

562
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 that confession of your heart will do to your willingness to follow him,

563
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 to hear him, to be more like him.

564
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 "Jesus, I trust you."

565
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 See how that realigns your heart and your priorities with his.

566
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 "Jesus, I trust you."

567
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 See how that impacts and affects your anxiety.

568
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 "Jesus, I trust you."

569
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 See, when we trust someone, it becomes so much easier to follow them.

570
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And here's the last thing.

571
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 It's all about the eyes.

572
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 It's all about the eyes.

573
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 See, we live in a world, as Andrew just shared, full of distraction.

574
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 There are things everywhere to look at.

575
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 There are things calling for our attention.

576
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And that's what the story was for these guys as well.

577
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 They walk into a land and it had obstacles and giants and grapes and

578
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 probably other things.

579
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 What's different, what allows us to follow God better with more of our

580
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 hearts is where we know where to fix our eyes.

581
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 I'm not saying you can't look and see other things.

582
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 We are aware that both Caleb, Joshua, and all the other ten saw the giants.

583
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 They all saw them.

584
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 They all saw the walls.

585
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 They saw the grapes.

586
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 But there's a difference in what you see and what you fix your eyes and your

587
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 attention on.

588
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And perhaps when we learn to fix our eyes on God, and not just because it's a

589
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 cool thing to do or because there's like a hymn about it somewhere, but when we

590
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 fix our eyes towards God, we see that's where our hope comes from.

591
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 When we fix our eyes towards God, that's where our strength to navigate through

592
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 these situations comes from.

593
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 When we fix our eyes on him, that's where all we need will come from.

594
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 See, the problem with the ten spies is that they had a vision problem.

595
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 They had a seeing problem.

596
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 They focused more of their eyes and their attention on the obstacles, on the

597
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 giants and on God.

598
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And if I'm honest, I'm very similar.

599
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Actually, both me and my wife are very similar.

600
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 We are what you call fix-it people.

601
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 We like to fix things.

602
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 If anything is slightly broken, slightly not working, we will try to fix it.

603
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Luckily, we've not tried to fix one another yet.

604
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 So still doing well.

605
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Oh, yeah.

606
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And sorry.

607
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 But here's the thing.

608
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 There's a role that we get to play in following God, and it's not the fixing.

609
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 It's fixing our eyes, but it's not the fixing.

610
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Because the battle that we step into, the mountains that are in front of us,

611
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 those obstacles have been overcome.

612
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 God has gone before you.

613
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 God has been there.

614
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 He makes a way where there is no way.

615
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 That's just what he does.

616
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 That's just who he is.

617
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And so when we fix our eyes on God and not on the problem, we stop trying to

618
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 solve it, and we let God be God, and we just follow.

619
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 That's not the easiest thing to do.

620
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 A lot of us like to fix things.

621
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 And so it requires us to be aware of this tendency in our hearts and to fix our

622
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 eyes on him.

623
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And think of Joshua, as the story continues.

624
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 If Joshua would have spent more time fixing his eyes on, okay, the walls are

625
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 this tall, a couple meters, and I need to get 15, 16 ladders, and I have 700

626
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 people, we need to -- if he started fixing his eyes on all the ways he could

627
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 overcome this obstacle, he potentially would have missed God.

628
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Because God's method wasn't the way that we would normally go.

629
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 No one looks at capturing a city or winning a battle by walking around it and

630
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 singing.

631
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 That's unheard of.

632
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Unless you fix your eyes.

633
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 In him, when we fix our eyes, that's where our victory is.

634
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And so, church, I want to encourage you this morning to fix your eyes, to trust

635
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 him.

636
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Make it a challenge to yourself this week, Jesus, I trust you.

637
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 To spend some time asking yourself, what am I holding back?

638
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 What am I withholding from him?

639
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 What are my reservations and why?

640
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Ask yourself, do you know him?

641
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Do you know of him?

642
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Do you know him?

643
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 And spend some time, read his stories, hear about who he is.

644
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 The Bible is full, full of ways for us to get to know him better.

645
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 And I think it's when we have that, we can walk in the confidence of Caleb to

646
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 fully, wholeheartedly follow God and God alone, devoted to just him.

647
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Let's pray.

648
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Jesus, we thank you that you call us to a place of very, very, very deep

649
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 surrender.

650
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 God, to a place where our eyes have to be set on you, our heart has to be

651
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 locked into who you are, and a place of getting to know you.

652
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 God, we thank you that the battle has been won.

653
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 God, we thank you that you are good and that we can trust that.

654
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 We thank you that you are faithful and we can trust that.

655
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 And God, you know each of our stories, you know each of the ways that we lean,

656
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 you know each of our tendencies.

657
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And Holy Spirit, we invite you in this moment to come and speak, to come and

658
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 illuminate the things that we are withholding, the things that we are

659
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 reserving, the ways in which we don't yet trust, the ways in which we don't

660
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 yet know.

661
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 God, we thank you that you are a God that is gracious and kind, that you are

662
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 patient, that you're not waiting for us to get it perfect, but you're waiting

663
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 for us to trust you enough to give all.

664
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 So God, would you help us, would you help me follow you more fully?

665
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

666
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,580
 (gentle music)
