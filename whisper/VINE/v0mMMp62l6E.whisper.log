[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   Anyway, say hello to somebody as you sit down.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.080]   Introduce yourself if you are watching online.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.480]   Introduce yourself online as well.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.720]   We would love to know who you are
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.080]   and where you're watching from.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.200]   Just tell us something about you.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.120]   We have a team online.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.440]   They love to engage with you and keep you feeling
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.600]   that you're part of what this service is,
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.200]   that you're not just watching,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.960]   but you're actually part of this service
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.920]   and feel part of the Vine family.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.520]   As well, wherever you are.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.480]   Well, if you are here today
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.720]   and it is your first time in the building visiting,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.520]   then we wanna give you a very warm welcome.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.560]   We would love to know who you are.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.440]   So would you raise your hand, give us a wave
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.760]   so we can welcome you.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.880]   Everybody's like, "Oh, no."
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.840]   Welcome.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.320]   Yes, if you're sat next to somebody who's waving,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.080]   give them a great big smile behind that mask.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.520]   And in the upper house,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.240]   it is good to have you join us as well.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.440]   And if you're watching online
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.680]   and this is your first time tuning in, a welcome to you.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.000]   My name is Carla.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.720]   I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.320]   And if you're online, we would love to connect with you.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.120]   So you can scan our code and send us your details.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.440]   We would love for one of our team to follow up with you
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.960]   and maybe tell you a little bit more
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.640]   about who we are as well.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.880]   And if you're here in person and visiting,
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.880]   we have a Connect Hub here just outside the auditorium.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.680]   That's a place that you can go to to ask questions,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.160]   find out a little bit more about who we are
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.600]   as The Vine Church, what we do,
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.960]   and how you can get more connected
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.880]   and feel part of this family as well.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.560]   And everybody else, it's so good to see your faces
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.600]   behind those masks.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.280]   Do you know, sometimes it feels like
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.440]   we've been wearing masks for so,
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.520]   well, I'm not wearing a mask, but yeah.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.200]   We've been wearing a mask for so long.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.960]   Sometimes when I see people without a mask,
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.280]   I'm like, "That's what you look like.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.320]   Wow, you're so beautiful and gorgeous and handsome."
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.960]   And there are days when I am so thankful for that mask.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.560]   You know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.040]   Well, here at The Vine,
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.640]   there are lots of things happening all of the time,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.280]   and this summer is no exception.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.240]   And our children are going to be having VBS,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.360]   Vacation Bible School.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.640]   And for all of you parents out there that you know,
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.480]   this is such an incredible opportunity for our children
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.640]   to come together, have such a blast.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.040]   I mean, it is fun on steroids.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   And at the same time, learn incredible truths about Jesus.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.440]   And this year, they are looking at monumental,
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.600]   the theme is monumental, how great is God?
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.080]   What a wonderful theme,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.680]   especially for our children during this time,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.040]   that they can learn that God is great.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.400]   And so, of course, it's a five-day extravaganza,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.360]   which means we need lots of volunteers.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.840]   And so, if you are able to volunteer for VBS this year,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.480]   it's being held from the 1st of August to the 5th of August.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.160]   That's five days of fun.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.480]   But there are so many different ways
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.680]   that you could potentially help or volunteer.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.960]   If you are crafty and you like making props
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.120]   or doing some sort of curriculum support,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.280]   you can do that prior to the event,
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.640]   or you can join the actual event.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.280]   And there are a number of different ways
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.880]   that you can help throughout that week.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.960]   So if you are able to, we would love to see you join us.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   It really is a fantastic time to pour into our children,
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.080]   and it's a lot of fun as well.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.480]   It's a bit tiring, but hey, that's okay.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.920]   And you can scan the QR code,
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.520]   and all the details will be there.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.480]   And showing you different ways that you can volunteer as well.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.080]   There are also new opportunities that are coming up
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.640]   through our different organisations
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.320]   that we support through our missions pathways
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.880]   in volunteering this summer.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.600]   And they've just posted a number of different initiatives.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.400]   So if you go online, check out what they are.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.040]   You can scan the QR code,
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.080]   and that will give you information about other ways
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.840]   you could serve throughout the summer.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.240]   If you've got a little bit of time,
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.960]   maybe you want to do something a little bit meaningful,
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.720]   that's a great way of serving the city
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.760]   through serving a lot of our local NGOs during the summer.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.920]   So it'll be fun for you as well.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.720]   We have also got an exciting thing happening
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.720]   at one o'clock today, and that is our baptism class.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.200]   Not baptisms, had to get that right.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   Baptisms are coming.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   If you would love to be baptised,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.440]   we would love to journey with you
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.400]   in what we at The Vine hold as our pre-baptism classes.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.520]   There are three classes.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   It is mandatory so that you really do understand
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.800]   what it means to make that commitment to be baptised.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.680]   So if you've been thinking about it,
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.400]   today, it's a very special offer.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.480]   You get to do a walk-in.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.400]   Yes!
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.640]   If you haven't registered and you thought to yourself,
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.160]   oh, I would really feel that prompting to be baptised,
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.800]   you can join the class at one o'clock
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.160]   in the mini hall this afternoon.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.440]   And this is, of course,
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.920]   this is the only opportunity as a walk-in.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.080]   So if you would like to do that, you are very welcome.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.200]   And for many of those that have registered,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.720]   it's at one o'clock in the mini hall today, first class.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.480]   And then the baptisms will be at Repulse Bay
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.880]   later in August.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.400]   Coming up in July, we have an exciting prayer walk.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.240]   Yes, you get to pray and walk.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.840]   How awesome is that?
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.520]   And guess where you're going to be prayer walking?
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.000]   I know, it's on the screen behind me.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.560]   Where are we church planting?
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.400]   Yuen Long.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.840]   Online, where are we church planting?
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.240]   Good job.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.680]   Yes, we are prayer walking in Yuen Long
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.160]   as we prepare and as we have been preparing
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.320]   to plant a church in Yuen Long.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.160]   So that will happen on Friday, the 22nd of July
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.280]   at seven o'clock.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.520]   And if that is something that you would like to get behind,
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.440]   if you have two legs and you can pray,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.080]   what a great way to do something to support your church
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.280]   and the church plant.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.320]   And that is happening end of July on that Friday.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.360]   You can scan the QR code for all of those details.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.720]   All right, that's enough of my announcements.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.920]   Yay.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.560]   Now we're gonna move into that time of offering.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.160]   So please, if you are part of our family,
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.600]   this is your local church.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.200]   This is the opportunity that we do as a church
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.880]   as part of our worship to give regularly.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.040]   A number of different ways showing on the screens right now.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.400]   And also if you're in-house,
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.360]   there are envelopes on your seats.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.520]   So would you join me as I pray for our offering?
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.840]   Father, we do thank you for your generosity.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.720]   And I, on behalf of the leadership,
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.920]   thank our congregation for their generosity too.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.720]   We cannot do what we do without resources.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.040]   And Father, even though COVID has put such a stop
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.680]   on many different things,
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.480]   we as a church do not believe we are called to stop.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.360]   We believe we are called to continue to move forward.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.080]   And we do that with the many different resources
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.240]   that you have blessed us with
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.200]   and the commitment of our faithful congregation.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.040]   So we thank you for that.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.120]   And Father, we pray that we would have boldness
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.240]   to continue to step forward.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.400]   We pray that you would continue to provide faithfully
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.720]   and generously as we continue to move forward
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.000]   into this city and beyond.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.400]   We pray for our offering in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.200]   Well, we are coming to the end of our sermon series
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.200]   on the book of Acts.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.880]   But I am very excited that to end that sermon series,
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.120]   we have one of our founding pastors,
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.040]   the very, very, very, very, very, very reverend,
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.320]   Pastor John Snellgrove.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.560]   Would you give him a great hand as we welcome him on stage?
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.640]   (congregation applauding)
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.880]   Now let's pray for John.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.480]   Father, we thank you that your Holy Spirit
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.440]   is present here right now, wherever we may be.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.440]   And Father, we pray for that anointing over John
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.440]   as he speaks boldly and declares the truth of your word.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.920]   Jesus, would our hearts be open to receive this
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.760]   and would we be transformed in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.280]   - Amen, let's hear it for Carla.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.360]   Well, thank you, Carla.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.800]   (congregation applauding)
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.560]   Wow, morning, everybody, and hi to everybody online.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.600]   Great to have you with us today.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.560]   But let's get straight to it this morning.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.040]   Open your Bibles or take out your iPhones
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:10.000]   and turn to Acts chapter 29.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.200]   That's right, Acts 29.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.680]   Come on, hurry up.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.880]   I haven't got all day.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.560]   Okay, I'm gonna put you out of your misery.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.600]   It's a trick.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.880]   It's like me saying, "Ken, I wanna invite you to dinner."
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.720]   You go, "Wow."
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.580]   "Ken, I wanna take you to the Mandarin Grill."
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.580]   You go, "Oh, double wow."
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.760]   Ken, on the 31st of September,
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.220]   you realize it's only 30 days in September.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.900]   The last chapter of Acts, the book of Acts in our Bible
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.540]   is of course, Acts 28.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.940]   What effect of COVID?
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:04.020]   I seem to have been watching rather a lot
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.940]   of Netflix series.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.780]   Now, the one thing I couldn't help noticing
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.260]   is with movies and TV series,
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.580]   they always seem to have a sequel.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.580]   Take "General Hospital."
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:25.100]   In June, the ABC soap reached a milestone
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.380]   that few other programs have seen.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.380]   It broadcast its 15,000th episode.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.860]   Now, how does that happen?
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.760]   I tell you how.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:41.060]   The producers, they leave the story in the air.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.400]   They create suspense.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.580]   I mean, you watch a film for two hours
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.200]   and then there is no apparent ending, why?
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.180]   Because it leads to a sequel.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:01.020]   We are talking today about the unfinished story.
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.300]   And may I remind you how we began
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.700]   the unfinished story series in March.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.640]   From Acts chapter one.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.520]   And yes, there is an Acts chapter one.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.160]   In my former book, "Theophilus," now stop there.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.380]   Luke wrote his gospel again,
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.720]   addressed to this guy, Theophilus.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.940]   It was his friend and it means lover of God.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.740]   So he said, "In my former book, my gospel, Theophilus,
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.740]   I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and teach
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.420]   until the day he was taken up to heaven
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:44.420]   after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.020]   to the apostles he had chosen."
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.620]   What a great start.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.060]   But have you wondered how it ends?
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.720]   I mean, endings matter.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   Whether it's a football game, whether it's a novel,
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.100]   whether it's a movie.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.780]   Have you ever wondered how the book of Acts ends
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.960]   and why it ends as it does?
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.480]   Well, let's investigate, shall we?
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.700]   Now, the book has been following the apostle Paul's life
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.340]   through all sorts of dangers and challenges.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:31.220]   He ends up in Rome under house arrest.
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.220]   He preaches in Rome and has some success,
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.620]   although not all the Jews were convinced.
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.620]   And then we read this, Acts 28, verse 30.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.940]   For two whole years, Paul stayed there
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.940]   in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.080]   He proclaimed the kingdom of God
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.840]   and taught about the Lord Jesus
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   with all boldness and without hindrance.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:09.540]   The end.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.340]   So what happened next?
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.460]   I mean, was Paul released?
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.780]   Was he brought to trial before the emperor?
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.340]   Was he convicted and martyred?
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.180]   We are not told.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:30.300]   I thought, what a strange way to end.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:35.140]   Why on earth does Luke end this way?
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:41.260]   Perhaps, perhaps he finished writing Acts
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.620]   while Paul was still in prison.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.640]   That would be about 62 AD.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.220]   And that this was as far as the story had got.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.140]   But this is very unlikely,
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.180]   since Luke almost certainly wrote it after 70
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.300]   because he used Mark's gospel as a source.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.600]   And Mark was written about 70.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.620]   So Luke probably writing in AD 80s,
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.900]   intended to end it here.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.060]   Why?
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:22.420]   Well, what is the book of Acts all about?
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.460]   Is it about the life of Paul?
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.220]   No.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.620]   What is it about?
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:36.540]   And most scholars agree that Acts 1:8 is the theme.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.740]   It's a methodical statement.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.180]   It's a critical verse, the words of the risen Jesus.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.780]   And he said this,
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:52.020]   "But you will receive power
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.500]   "when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:03.760]   "And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.420]   "in all Judea and Samaria,
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.580]   "and to the ends of the earth."
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.140]   Acts is not a general history of the early church.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:20.100]   It is not everything that Luke knows
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.420]   about the history of the early Christianity.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.180]   It is too limited for that.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.400]   There's too much that he's left out.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:33.100]   Rather, I believe that the book of Acts
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.100]   is the development, the working out of Acts 1:8.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:44.100]   So it's about the Holy Spirit coming upon them.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.020]   The book of Acts is sometimes called
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.500]   the book of the Holy Spirit,
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.580]   the Acts of the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.280]   We have Pentecost,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.140]   then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit,
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.900]   addressing the Sanhedrin in Acts 4.
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.900]   Then the Spirit falling on the new believers in Samaria.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.420]   The Spirit forbidding Paul to go to certain places
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.580]   and then guiding him to others.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.580]   The Holy Spirit is mentioned 59 times in the book of Acts.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:29.620]   And the book of Acts is about being witnesses.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:36.040]   Witnesses to Jesus.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:36.940]   He said, didn't he?
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.060]   "You will be my witnesses."
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.060]   I mean, think of Stephen.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.500]   Think of Paul, Peter, Philip.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.320]   We examine them all.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:56.520]   But witnessing is a rather foreboding word, isn't it?
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:03.300]   I have to say it's somewhat of a dirty word
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.580]   in some church circles.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.200]   Everyone says, "Oh, my faith, it's personal."
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:17.080]   But in Acts, it's simply telling a story.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.660]   The story of Jesus,
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.660]   the story of how Jesus changed someone's life.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.000]   The story of how Jesus changed the whole community.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.900]   And it is about being witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.700]   to the ends of the earth.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:42.620]   So Luke tells this story.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:48.780]   Jerusalem first, then they go to Samaria
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.580]   and then the gospel expands.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.380]   Does it reach the ends of the earth?
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.820]   Actually, where are the ends of the earth anyway?
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.940]   Rome?
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:03.980]   Heck no.
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.400]   From a Greco-Roman perspective,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.940]   Rome was the center of the earth.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.020]   If you go back to Luke chapter one,
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.820]   or Luke chapter two, sorry, our Christmas narrative,
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.660]   we read of a decree going out
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.300]   from the Emperor Augustus in Rome
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.540]   to the whole inhabited world.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.060]   Rome was the center.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.820]   But for either Greeks or Jews or Romans,
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.380]   the world extends far beyond Rome
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.340]   to the rest of Europe, to Spain,
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.340]   and onwards to America, Africa, Asia, Hong Kong.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:56.620]   The ends of the earth is the ends of the earth.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.500]   So why does Acts end in Rome?
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.700]   Endings matter.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.540]   Why end in Rome?
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.420]   I'll tell you why.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:16.820]   The story is not complete.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:23.140]   The story is not complete.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.300]   The story is not complete.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:32.300]   Acts 1, 8 is not fulfilled with Paul's arrival in Rome.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.180]   Witnesses to be to the ends of the earth.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.900]   That is a target beyond Rome, which is not reached in Acts.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:47.060]   But the crucial point is that the ending of Acts
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.780]   is a non-ending.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.020]   It is not an ending at all.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.420]   Why not?
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:01.540]   Because Luke intended a volume three.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:05.500]   He intended an Acts 29.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.260]   Not one that he would write,
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.420]   but one that the Holy Spirit would write
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.580]   in the life of the church.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.060]   Like a movie where the movie writer
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.940]   ends with a sequel in mind.
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.060]   Like "The Lord of the Rings"
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.980]   or "The Pirates of the Caribbean."
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:33.780]   But in this case, Luke is not gonna write volume three.
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.580]   Rather, the Holy Spirit will.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:45.260]   With future Christians as actors.
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.540]   That's us.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.540]   We are part of the cast of Acts.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:02.220]   But as a sort of prelude to volume three and Acts 29,
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.820]   I wanna look at how Luke ends volume two
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.020]   in Acts chapter 27 and 28.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:14.020]   And to do that, I want to tell you a story.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.140]   It's the story of a journey
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.580]   and a very eventful journey.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.300]   A trip across the Mediterranean Sea
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.260]   that certainly was not a pleasure cruise.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:34.940]   To help us navigate, I put a map on the screen.
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.060]   We're gonna start with our first scene,
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.260]   which is starting out by sailing to Rome.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.860]   As we open the story in Acts 27, we are at Caesarea.
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.020]   And we are confronted with the statement,
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:57.020]   when it was decided that we would sail for Italy.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:02.380]   That suggests that Paul did not travel alone to Rome,
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.740]   but that Luke and perhaps other disciples
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.320]   accompanied Paul on his journey.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.660]   We certainly know of at least one more disciple
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.300]   that traveled with Paul.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.740]   His name was Aristarchus.
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.800]   Because he was mentioned by Paul in Colossians
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   as a fellow prisoner.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:27.860]   From the record, it seems that the Roman governor Festus
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.060]   placed Paul and the Roman escorts
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.820]   on what we would call a freighter ship
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.220]   that would make many steps on the way to Italy,
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.980]   dropping off and picking off points.
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.780]   I suppose an old-fashioned deliveroo probably.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.460]   Whilst unloading cargo at Sidon,
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:53.140]   Paul was allowed to go and see his friends in that city.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:23:00.360]   Now the story continues as Luke recounts for us
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.460]   the difficulty of their travel.
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:08.460]   It was the time of year that the winds had shifted
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:14.580]   and made sailing a long and dangerous task.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.980]   Verse nine indicates that they were traveling
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.540]   at a dangerous time.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.800]   Things were about to get worse.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.860]   Now some background here in ancient times.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.300]   Sailing the seas after September the 15th
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.820]   was not advisable.
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.140]   I guess a little bit like our mid-autumn festival
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.540]   here in Hong Kong, right?
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.620]   Cloudy weather would sit in
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.620]   and it would make the navigation difficult
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.980]   since sailors were able to navigate their position
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.380]   using the position of the stars.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.500]   In fact, from November the 11th to March the 10th,
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.140]   all seafaring ships stayed in port.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.780]   Now based on this information, Paul addresses the crew,
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.040]   stating it seems clear
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.960]   that the voyage is headed for disaster.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.080]   However, it seems that the captain believed,
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.860]   ah, he could get them to Italy without harm.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:20.460]   Therefore the centurion listened to the advice of the captain
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.820]   rather than the words of Paul.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:28.440]   We read this, since they should not stay at Fairhavens,
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:33.440]   they set sail for Phoenix on Crete to winter there.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.040]   And in verse 13, we're told a favorable wind helped them
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.160]   on their way towards Phoenix.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   However, the weather quickly changed
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.960]   as a violent Northeast wind rushed in upon them.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.360]   In fact, commentators agree that this storm is a typhoon,
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.680]   which we in Hong Kong know very well.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.100]   We had a T8 last week.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.140]   And Luke literally writes that the ship was unable
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.380]   to face the eye of the wind.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.520]   The ship became unmanageable and they had to ride it out
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.980]   as the wind took the bloat wherever it pleased it.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:20.760]   As the wind drove the ship out to sea,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.020]   they were able to get some shelter,
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.600]   providing the crew enough time
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.900]   to bring the lifeboat onto the ship.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:35.060]   Next, the crew tied ropes to the ship
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.040]   to keep it from breaking apart in the violent storm.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.080]   The crew then let's down the anchor to keep the ship
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.140]   from drifting too far out to sea.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:53.040]   The storm is so bad that the crew must jettison
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.360]   any extra cargo from the ship.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.400]   In fact, things were so bad
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.660]   that the crew must throw overboard the ship's gear,
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.460]   which would have included the main mask and its rigging.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:12.080]   By verse 20, we see that hope becomes lost upon the crew.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.680]   They do not believe they are gonna make it
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.720]   through the storm.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.360]   And Paul writes in verse 20,
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:26.360]   we finally gave up all hope of being saved.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.400]   It was in the midst of this despair
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.720]   that Paul reminds the crew,
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.560]   they should have listened to his words.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.080]   I told you so, right?
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:42.440]   However, Paul is able to offer encouragement
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.680]   because we read in verse 23,
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.120]   the previous night, an angel of God told Paul
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:52.160]   he would stand trial before Caesar in Rome
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.160]   and all the people on the ship would not be saved.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.720]   The people on the ship would not lose their lives,
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:03.640]   but they are not immediately to get to the destination.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   They will run aground on some island.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.920]   Now fearing they would run aground on some rocky place,
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.600]   some of the sailors tried to escape the ship
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.560]   by getting on the lifeboat.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.520]   But Paul warns the centurion
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.240]   that unless these men stay on the ship,
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.140]   he would not have his life spared.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:31.480]   The centurion wisely listens to Paul this time
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.280]   and cuts the rope holding the lifeboat
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.820]   to prevent anyone from escaping.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:41.160]   At this time, we learn from the book of Acts,
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.160]   there are 276 people on this ship.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:53.200]   Knowing that the shipwreck is imminent,
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.800]   the crew throws grain overboard to lighten the ship,
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:04.200]   which leads us to scene two, which is the shipwreck.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.440]   Not knowing where they are,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.520]   the crew sees a bay with a beach
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.620]   and attempts to run the boat ashore.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.640]   Running into a reef, the ship becomes jammed
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.800]   and the waves begin to break up the stern.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.160]   The soldiers plan to kill all the prisoners
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.680]   so that no one would escape.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.640]   However, the centurion wants to save Paul
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.240]   and he keeps the soldiers from carrying out their plan.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.520]   Those who could swim were ordered to swim to shore
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.480]   while the rest would float on planks and debris
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.180]   on the shipwreck to shore.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.920]   Once ashore, the crew find out
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.280]   they're on the island of Malta.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.120]   We've got there.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.280]   I've been there a couple of times, it's very nice.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:01.000]   We read the local people show kindness
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.840]   to the shipwreck crew.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.920]   They provide them with fire and hospitality,
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:12.120]   but, and it's a big but,
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:18.440]   while Paul was gathering wood, a viper,
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.540]   one of the world's deadliest snakes,
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:27.540]   came out and fastened itself onto his hand and gulp.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:32.700]   The immediate reaction of the local people
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.280]   was that Paul was a murderer and justice was coming to him.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.560]   However, Paul shook off the viper.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.980]   He shook it off into the fire and suffered no harm.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.560]   The locals were waiting.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.180]   They expected Paul have his hand swelled up
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.340]   or to be killed by the snake bite.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.320]   Obviously showing that the viper was poisonous.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.180]   Seeing that nothing happened to Paul,
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.020]   the local people changed their minds
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.480]   and they believed he was a God.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.620]   It's funny, isn't it?
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.660]   People are fickle.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.620]   While on the island,
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.940]   the father of one of the leading men, Publius,
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.320]   suffered from fever and dysentery.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.560]   After Paul prayed and laid hands upon him,
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.940]   the man was healed.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.720]   And we read that many other on the island with illnesses
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.680]   came to Paul and were healed.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:37.980]   Leads us on to our third scene, onto Rome.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.300]   After waiting out the winter months,
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.880]   they set sail in another Alexandrian ship
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   which had wintered there.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.960]   Finally, after much turmoil,
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   you'll see from the map, Paul reaches Rome.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:05.920]   Once in Rome, Paul was permitted to stay by himself
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.800]   with the Roman soldier who guarded him.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.540]   After three days, Paul summoned the Jewish leaders
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.260]   and gives an explanation as to why he has come to Rome
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.420]   and why he's in chains.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:26.300]   This gave an opportunity for Paul to preach all day long
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.360]   concerning the kingdom of God
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.980]   and persuade them concerning Jesus.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.020]   We read in verse 24 that some were persuaded
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.640]   but others did not believe.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.100]   And so Paul concluded his teaching
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.400]   to those who were leaving,
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.660]   saying they were fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah.
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:49.140]   Isaiah said they were being unwilling to see and hear
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.760]   about the great work that God had done through Christ.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.060]   Therefore, Paul would go and preach his message
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.340]   to the Gentiles.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:01.620]   Let me remind you this.
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.580]   For two whole years,
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:07.260]   Paul stayed there in his own rented house
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.660]   and welcomed all who'd come to see him.
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.740]   He proclaimed the kingdom of God
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.820]   and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:20.320]   all with a boldness and without hindrance.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.860]   What an amazing story.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:28.180]   I mean, it beats Johnny Depp and the pirates, doesn't it?
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:34.900]   But what are the applications?
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.500]   What does it mean for us?
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.040]   I'd like to highlight three things.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:49.380]   Number one, trusting God in all circumstances.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:55.780]   One of the first lessons we clearly see in this story
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.260]   is the disciples' ability to trust God at all times.
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:05.540]   Paul went from the Jews plotting his death in Jerusalem
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.120]   to the foolishness of the captain in the bad weather.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:16.620]   And all Paul had to hold onto was God's promise
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.280]   that he would testify about the Lord in Rome.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:24.580]   But even those words would have been difficult to believe
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.820]   when you're on a ship in the middle of a typhoon.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:35.860]   In Acts 27, 20, we see the hopelessness of the situation.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.620]   He said this, "When neither sun nor stars
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.820]   "appeared for many days and the storm continued raging,
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.820]   "we finally gave up all hope of being saved."
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:55.980]   The hopes that they would get out of that mess were lost.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.140]   They believed, didn't they?
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.580]   We're all gonna die.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.200]   The storm was unexpected.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.680]   The storm was unmanageable.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.780]   The storm was unrelenting.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:15.280]   A passing thought.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.660]   Isn't life like that sometimes?
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:25.760]   We often face many storms in life.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.460]   But even though we face many storms,
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.000]   we can still have a spirit of thanksgiving in our hearts
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.400]   in the midst of a storm.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.600]   Paul stands up and declares
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.460]   that there will be no loss of life.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.520]   Why?
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.640]   Because God says so.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.160]   We see the confidence of Paul
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.260]   that God was gonna bring him through.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:55.840]   We cannot overemphasize the confidence
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.740]   that we must develop in our faith in God
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.880]   that no matter how difficult things get,
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.900]   God will remain with us.
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:10.480]   We cannot forget and we must always believe
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.840]   that there is nothing that we are experiencing
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.280]   that is not common to others as well.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.680]   What an amazing service we had
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.400]   with Branches of Hope last week.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.400]   We saw, didn't we, only last week
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.080]   from those in our road community, in our stop community.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.120]   We have a great many people at this very church
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.940]   who have shown great strength.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.520]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.320]   Their levels of faith make mine look weak sometimes.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:49.880]   If God will not allow us to go through
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.480]   more than we can handle,
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.120]   then church, we have some very strong Christians
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.060]   in our midst.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.560]   If we're not that strong yet,
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.200]   we can become that strong in our faith.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.280]   We can take strength from the faith of those who are here.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.380]   We are an encouragement to each other
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.200]   as we go through our difficulties.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.800]   We feel the pain together,
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.360]   but we share in the strength of each other's faith.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.600]   So that's the first application.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.980]   The second application is this,
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:35.260]   preaching in all circumstances.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.320]   I love this guy, Paul.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.720]   He never missed, never wasted an opportunity.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:46.000]   How about Paul preaching in every circumstance
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.320]   he found himself in?
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.720]   What an amazing man.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.520]   It didn't matter what was going on in his life.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.960]   His first thoughts would be evangelistic.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.680]   Just days after arriving in Rome,
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.600]   Paul calls for the Jewish leaders
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.160]   to begin to teach to them.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.120]   When Paul was on a house arrest,
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.400]   he preached not only to the people who came to see him,
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.800]   but even to the Roman guards to whom he was chained.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.200]   That's a captive audience, isn't it?
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.880]   Every soldier that was chained to him
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.160]   would hear about the kingdom of God
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.140]   and the message of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:26.760]   Finally, Paul had run through every guard.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.600]   So that he could say that his imprisonment
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.040]   had actually furthered the gospel.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.480]   And the gospel had been spread
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.760]   throughout the whole imperial guard.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.400]   What about us?
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:52.880]   We are called to preach the gospel in all circumstances.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.960]   We must persist in proclaiming the gospel message.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.760]   Can you imagine teaching Caesar's household?
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.820]   Could you imagine preaching to the imperial guard of Rome?
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:11.540]   Unfortunately, our motto has been this.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:17.620]   Preach the gospel under no circumstances.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.960]   We come up with excuses, don't we?
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.000]   Not to speak about the word of God
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.380]   in nearly every instance arises.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.460]   We assume that person doesn't want to hear.
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.580]   We think it's not a good time.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.180]   Is it ever a good time?
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.160]   Or are we just soothing our consciences
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.100]   because we know we need to be workers in God's kingdom?
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:49.100]   My friends, preach and teach in all circumstances.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.680]   Let nothing hinder us from the work of the Lord.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.820]   Our last application is this.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:02.640]   Encouraging others in all circumstances.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.900]   As I look at these chapters we just read,
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.820]   what an encourager Paul had become.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:13.500]   When we look at the book of Acts, we say Barnabas.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.380]   Oh yeah, Barnabas was known as the son of encouragement.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.420]   But Paul did a great work
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.100]   in encouraging the saints and the unbelievers.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.300]   It is from this house arrest
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.980]   that we believe Paul wrote many letters,
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.620]   including Colossians, Philippians and Ephesians.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.460]   I'm gonna make a suggestion to you.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.860]   I'm gonna suggest you take some time this week
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.780]   and that you read Colossians, Philippians and Ephesians.
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.740]   And you remember as you read them,
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.020]   you read them in the light
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:53.400]   that these were Paul's words that Paul wrote
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.000]   while he was under house arrest.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.940]   Did tough times stop us from being encouragers of others
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:00.940]   that we ought to be?
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.980]   Paul would acknowledge his condition,
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.220]   but turn his attention to the needs of others,
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.780]   encouraging them to be strong in the Lord
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.380]   and never turn away from the truth.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:20.340]   We too can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:28.020]   In all circumstances, let us always trust God,
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.180]   preach God and encourage others in the faith.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.580]   As Paul said in 1 Corinthians 11,
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.340]   "Imitate me as I imitate Christ."
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:42.080]   My dear friends,
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.900]   although the book has finished,
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.020]   our sermon series has finished as well.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.480]   The story has not.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:41:00.280]   Luke finishes with a subliminal message to be continued.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:07.540]   The open ending tells us that
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:12.780]   we as the readers
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.660]   are to finish the story.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:19.760]   We continue the writing.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.220]   It is to include the readers,
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.460]   you in the continuing work of spreading the word.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:34.020]   It challenges us to press on with the unfinished task.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:42.080]   But what are the contents of Acts 29?
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.460]   What is the script for volume three?
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:52.200]   The clue is found again in Acts 1.8.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.600]   You will receive power when the Holy Spirit
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.640]   has come upon you.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:01.600]   There's no full stop by that.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.040]   You will receive power when the Holy Spirit
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.560]   has come upon you and, and you will be my witnesses
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.640]   in Jerusalem, in Judea and Samaria
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.560]   and the ends of the earth.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.800]   You will be my witnesses in Hong Kong, Kowloon,
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.520]   new territories, China and the ends of the earth.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.480]   Here I'm writing a new version for you.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:28.160]   The power of the Spirit at work in the church
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.520]   and the world and being witnesses.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.040]   Let's go back to Luke.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.080]   Luke wrote a two volume work.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.640]   It was Luke's gospel and the book of Acts.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.780]   The story of Jesus, Luke's gospel was not complete.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:53.020]   The story of Jesus called for and demanded a volume two,
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:57.640]   which Luke accordingly writes.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:02.080]   Luke recognised that the story of Jesus was incomplete.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.400]   It pointed forward and demanded the church.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:12.240]   And just as the story of Jesus called for a volume two,
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:19.320]   so it calls for a volume three and Acts 29
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:25.000]   and a very, very, very long volume three,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.620]   a very, very long chapter.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:32.420]   The way that Luke ends Acts makes it very clear.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:39.080]   Acts 29 is to be a chapter that echoes the story of Jesus,
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:43.080]   a chapter similarly empowered by the Spirit
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.560]   to be witnesses to Jesus to the ends of the earth.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.360]   A chapter where we live out the reality
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.820]   that despite the worst that can happen,
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:44:00.140]   God's Word progresses, God's power sets people free
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.840]   and God's love transforms communities.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:11.400]   Church, the book of Acts is an unfinished book.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:18.440]   It has never been completed.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.400]   It suddenly ends.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.680]   Luke does not even write finish at the end.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.980]   He leaves it there.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:30.400]   He never gets back to it because of course,
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.720]   the Holy Spirit intended it to be unfinished.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.080]   It is still being written.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:42.140]   The book of Acts is the book of the record of the things
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.640]   which Jesus began both to do and teach.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.800]   Is he through yet?
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.400]   No.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.440]   He's still working, isn't he?
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:59.460]   Acts 29 is now being written.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.180]   Being written, yeah.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:06.740]   Acts 29 is now being written.
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:11.500]   When this great book is completed
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.940]   and in glory, you and I get to read it,
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.000]   I just wonder,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.020]   what will be your part in it?
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.580]   As the band comes back, I'm gonna ask you to stand.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.880]   I'd like to pray for you.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.200]   Can everybody stand?
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:41.320]   If you're watching at home, you can stand if you like.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.500]   If you're riding the MTR, it might be difficult.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:48.140]   I don't know, but I want you at home to feel part of this.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.300]   My friends, if you feel comfortable,
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.500]   either here or online,
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.740]   can you just stretch your hands out in front of you?
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.320]   (gentle music)
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.700]   The Holy Spirit is here today.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:07.000]   The Holy Spirit wants to fill you.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   He doesn't wanna fill you so you feel good about yourself
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.680]   or feel good about church.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:21.140]   He wants to fill you because there's a job for you to do.
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:28.260]   Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, ends of the earth.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:33.660]   Where's your Jerusalem?
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:37.020]   It might be your family or the people you work with,
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.860]   people that you see daily.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.840]   Where's your Judea and Samaria?
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.820]   Might be the lady outside the Vine Center
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.600]   who's collecting rubbish,
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.940]   just needs someone to give her encouraging words.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.800]   Where's your Judea?
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.460]   Where's your ends of the earth?
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:04.060]   Carla already mentioned there's lots of opportunities
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:06.180]   for our mission organizations this summer.
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.420]   Rather than just let that go by,
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.980]   could that be you who steps out from your desk
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:19.980]   and your comfort zone to fulfill the Great Commission?
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.120]   You can't do this on your own.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.560]   You need the Holy Spirit.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.900]   You don't need a little bit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.340]   You know, I went to church today,
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:35.960]   yeah, there was a lot of Holy Spirit there.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.060]   You need to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.440]   And actually to be filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.240]   you need to be emptied of yourself.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.300]   Many of us do.
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.940]   We're too full of ourselves.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.820]   So just take this time as you put your hands out
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.880]   to empty yourself.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:06.140]   And Father, we ask that you would come to your church,
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:10.820]   here in this building, online, wherever people are listening,
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:14.400]   and fill us once again with your Holy Spirit.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.000]   We need you.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.440]   We need you desperately.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.020]   (gentle music)
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:30.000]   Do you realize 94% of people in Hong Kong are not Christian?
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:37.680]   They need you to be filled with the Holy Spirit today,
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.040]   so the 6% can reach the 94%.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.620]   (gentle music)
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:48.200]   Do you recognize the worldview around the world
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.320]   is going decidedly non-Christian?
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:49:00.440]   They need Christians who will be full of the Holy Spirit,
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.240]   who will speak up for the gospel.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:09.760]   You might be saying, "Hey, look, it's not me."
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.080]   You know, I understand, John,
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.760]   how you'd talk to the taxi driver
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.160]   and the guy on the bus, you'd talk to anybody,
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.500]   but that's just not me.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.120]   Guys, it's not an option.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.060]   It is you.
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:27.280]   There are people in your workplace.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.880]   There are people in your family.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.760]   There are people in your circle
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.940]   that God has ordained you to speak to.
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:43.360]   It might start off by you just doing
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.380]   a random act of kindness for them.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.560]   (gentle music)
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.300]   And being able to follow up that,
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.020]   "Yes, I was able to do this because I'm a Christian."
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.400]   Can I pray for you?
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:07.820]   Do you know, I've lived in Hong Kong 35 years,
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:12.820]   and I've asked the question, "Can I pray for you?"
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:16.260]   I don't know how many times.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:22.660]   I cannot remember somebody in Hong Kong saying no.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:30.020]   I actually remember three years ago, I was in Jerusalem,
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.900]   I asked somebody if I could pray for him,
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.740]   and he actually said no.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.940]   I was taken aback.
[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.260]   It was the first time that had happened for a while.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:39.340]   You can pray for people.
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:40.680]   You can minister to them.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.640]   You can show Christ love.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.220]   (gentle music)
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:53.020]   We need the Holy Spirit for the people of Yuen Long.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:57.200]   It's no point us going to Yuen Long
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.060]   with a great plan for a church plant.
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:04.060]   We need the Holy Spirit.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:10.560]   Let's just wait on Him.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.840]   Allow Him to fill you afresh.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:19.780]   Worship Him in your hearts.
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:28.220]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:33.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.820]   (gentle music)
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.400]   (gentle music)
