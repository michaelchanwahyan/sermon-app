1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Thank you, Tim. Can we put our hands together for Tim?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Right, so me and Roslyn, we've been married for a few years and throughout the whole time,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 okay, she's sitting here. She wasn't here on the first service, she's here right now.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 So throughout the whole time we've been together, she actually, she's bought me two pens.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I'm going to show you today. And she's like, "What?"

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 So the first one I'm going to show you, one of it, it's a very, very nice Montblanc fountain pen.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 It's very, very nice. One day she just started, you know, she realized I started using this kind of pen,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 trying to look I'm very cultured, and so she bought me one of these.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 But this is not what I want to talk about today.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 The other pen that I actually want to show you and talk about is this pen she bought me.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So I'll show you this side, I guess. So I believe what caught your eye about the very first moment,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 it's this huge rock sitting on top of this pen. And don't worry, I can guarantee you 100%, this is fake.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Don't worry about that. She actually bought this two weeks after I brought a real diamond ring,

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 flew all the way from Hong Kong to Singapore, got down on one knee,

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 asked the most important question in my life, and she said yes to it.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And after two weeks, she bought me this. So when she can show off her ring, and I can show off this one as well.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 That's what I do, I love it. And speaking of diamond rings,

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I wonder if any guys, married men in the room, you still kind of recall or remember that ache from breaking your bank?

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Anybody? Okay, you don't have to put up your hands. I'm not going to embarrass you.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I don't want you to be in trouble. But I, hi sweetheart.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I don't know when you were looking for the perfect ring, were there any friends around you who said,

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 "Hey, you know what, I got a contact. I got someone who does this kind of business,

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 and I surely have those kind of friends." And I remember when I started this journey looking for the perfect ring,

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 so-called, I don't know if she feels the same, but when I was trying to look for the perfect ring,

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 at the beginning I had a, actually I have a number, I have a figure inside, an amount of money inside of my head.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 That was referencing a friend of mine a while back when he did the thing, proposed, and I had an amount in my head.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And so then my friends who have contacts started approaching me and giving me these contacts.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So I just randomly messaged one, and that person just got back and sent me a few different pictures,

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 and then you know, those details about the diamond, and then the numbers, the amount,

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 and I'm like, "Wow, the lowest amount, amount of all those rings, it's double the price of what I had in mind."

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And so that's okay, another friend of mine said, "Hey, you have to check my friend out, or this shop out."

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 But that one, I have to go to one of these commercial center or buildings, I have to take an elevator all the way up,

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 enter the shop, and sit down, and then there they present the rings to me, or the diamonds to me,

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 and when they took out the diamonds, the cheapest diamond there was double the price of the most expensive diamond I received on WhatsApp.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And so I was asking myself, "What can I say to get out of this place as soon as possible?

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 How can I just run away?"

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 But then this other question just popped up in my head that said, "But is she worth it?"

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 [Audience "Ooooh"s]

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Like...

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 [Laughter]

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I'm a bit embarrassed right now.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Yeah, so after all, I just, you know, my butt just stick to the chair, I just sat there, and then I tried to, you know,

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 pick and look according to those four C's, you know those four C's?

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Color, Cut, Carat, and Clarity, I still remember a little bit of it.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And I swiped the card, and a couple weeks later I brought that ring with the diamond, you know,

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 flew all the way to Singapore, and the rest is history.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 So, there at the diamond shop that day, I faced a question, or a choice,

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 which actively required me to evaluate how much was I willing to give,

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 or how much was I willing to sacrifice for the person whom I claim I love,

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 and wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And I realized, yes, that now includes you as well, honey.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And I realized, while we always say love is intangible, love is actually measurable.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Love is measured by sacrifice. Can I get an amen for that?

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 So actually that echoes with what Jesus told his disciples or his friends the night before he went to the cross.

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Jesus says this, and it's recorded in John 15 verse 13, he said,

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 "Greater love has no one than this, to lay down one's life for one's friend.

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 The greatest love one could ever have for another person is expressed in an act of self-sacrifice."

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 This is the agape love that we talked about a couple weeks ago.

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Of course, here Jesus, when he talks about this love, he's referring to the sacrifice he's going to make for his friends.

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 That's you and me here.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 And the apostle actually used marriage as one of his imageries to portrait the relationship between Christ and his bride, that is the church, that's us.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 You know, the groom would have to pay a price to make a sacrifice, to prepare a gift for the bride,

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 to invite her into a covenant relationship for eternity.

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And in the same way, Jesus, he has paid a price on the cross to prepare eternal life as a gift,

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 to invite us, his bride, into this eternal covenant relationship with him.

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Love always seeks a gift rather than to take.

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 That's what Jesus is.

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 That's how his love looked like.

69
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Love is measured by sacrifice.

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And as we enter this kind of relationship with Jesus, with God, we would find ourselves often first at this receiving end of this agape love.

71
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 But as this sacrificial love starts to impact us, impact our hearts and our souls,

72
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 and we realize our hearts will start to respond to this kind of love.

73
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Often this love we have for God in response to his love for us, we normally express it through an act called worship.

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So part of worship is basically showing gratitude to God who loves us and cares for us.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And you may find a lot of worship songs that are written, you know, on this theme that,

76
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 "Oh, how great is your love, God. Thank you for your love. Your love is amazing," and so on and so on.

77
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 It's written or sung in response to the love of God for us.

78
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 But as we are drawn deeper into this relationship with God, as we begin to know who he is,

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 and by knowing I'm not talking about information, I'm not talking about hat knowledge,

80
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I'm talking about heart knowledge, the word that's in the Bible is called "dinosco,"

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 it means experiential knowledge, it means intimacy.

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 As we grow deeper in our intimacy, in our relationship with Jesus,

83
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 and we don't just worship him or praise him because of what he has done for us,

84
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 we start to realize who he is, and we praise him for who he is.

85
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 That's the first song we sang just now this morning.

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 We praise him for who he is, for all the amazing attributes, all his character, his nature.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 That's what we do. And we simply sing songs to him or praise him because he is God, he is the almighty Yahweh.

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 The English word "worship" actually comes from a much older English word.

89
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 It's called "worth-ship," which means ascribing or recognizing worth, value, or honor to someone

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 or something. So we also have songs that describe who God is.

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 We sing these songs like, "God, you are worthy, you are mighty, you are powerful," and so on and so on.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 So here we see worship actually starts with us recognizing who God is

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 and receiving his agape, sacrificial love, and out of that experience, our hearts respond in gratitude.

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And we start to give him back the same kind of self-giving love.

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And therefore, in worship, we often find ourselves not just on the receiving end of God's love,

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 but that love also moves us to a place where we want to give and offer something to God.

97
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 We offer him a praise, a worship, a thanksgiving, etc., etc.

98
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 But here's the thing, church. For the past couple of minutes when I've been talking about worship,

99
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 probably what we were thinking inside of our head, the images we have in our heads, are songs.

100
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Or maybe the three songs we just sang at the beginning of the service, or the act of singing,

101
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 maybe that's what you're thinking about. But imagine if you're having a conversation with an Israelite

102
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 who lived in the Old Testament times, and when you mention the word "worship,"

103
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 he would probably have a very different picture or image in his mind.

104
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 If you say to him, "Hey, come on, let's worship," he would say, "Where's the animal? Where's the animal?"

105
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 You see, for the Israelites who are rooted in their identity as God's chosen people,

106
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 worship is not just something they do occasionally on a Sunday morning.

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 While, yes, it still involves singing, or the songs of praise, all that, but it goes way beyond that.

108
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Worship has to take place, first of all, in a certain place, the temple.

109
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Because that's where God actually lives. The God of the universe, he lives inside this human-made temple.

110
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 The temple is the only place on the entire planet where heaven and earth actually meet.

111
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 That's where God, he dwells. And that's the hot spot of God's presence.

112
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And worship is all about entering into this presence of God, who is the ultimate source of joy and love

113
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 and peace and happiness and blessings, so we can enjoy that relationship with him.

114
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 The problem is, as human beings, we're separated from this holy God by our sins,

115
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 by the evil thoughts and deeds that have polluted our hearts and our souls and our entire being.

116
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 We cannot approach God. I know I'm a sinner, and I know I have contributed to the evil in this world around us.

117
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 If the God of justice is going to do something about it, the simplest way, or the simplest thing to do

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 is to remove me from the face of the earth.

119
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 But the God of justice, our God of justice, he's also a God of mercy and of grace.

120
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 He doesn't want anyone of us who was made in his image to perish.

121
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 So he gave us a way out by allowing an animal to die in our place.

122
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And so that animal would become our substitute.

123
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 And therefore, in the Old Testament, when a sinful human being wants to approach the presence of God,

124
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 wants to worship him, wants to receive and enjoy his love and his goodness,

125
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 it requires the sacrifice of an animal to die in his or her place.

126
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 In the Bible, it's called atonement, which means to cover over someone's debt.

127
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So animal sacrifice was central to the worship of Israel,

128
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 because that's how they received forgiveness of sin from the Lord,

129
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 and how they could breach that barrier separating them and God.

130
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And there's another problem.

131
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 The effect of this animal sacrifice is quite temporary.

132
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And one moment I offer a sacrifice to God so I can enjoy his love and blessings and all that,

133
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 hallelujah, and praise, but then the next moment I went straight back into my sinful lifestyle.

134
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Nothing has really changed in my heart.

135
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 The sacrifice only took care of the consequence of my sin,

136
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 but it was never enough to deal with the root problem inside of me.

137
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And in fact, there was actually a point in the history of Israel, recorded in the book of Isaiah,

138
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 that God explicitly said he was so fed up with the sin and corruption of Israel

139
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 that he found the sacrifice and worship detestable.

140
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 I hate it. I don't want to hear it. I'm closing my ears, God said.

141
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 And so apparently, what happened with those Israelites is that while love seeks to give,

142
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 not all giving is out of love, and not all sacrifice offered on the altar was a real act of worship.

143
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 They only went through the motions of offering a sacrifice with an empty heart,

144
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 and they were not really sorry about their wrongdoings or their evil deeds,

145
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 and their hearts were not truly repentant, and they were not really longing to reconcile with God.

146
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 They just want something from God.

147
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And so offering a sacrifice had become, at best, a transaction.

148
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 I give you something, I give something up in order to take something.

149
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 At best, that's a transaction.

150
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 At worst, it's an attempt of manipulation of God for his forgiveness and blessing.

151
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 A system of temporary sacrifice at the temple was never enough,

152
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 and it couldn't really solve the problem of sin and bring God's people back to himself

153
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 until God, who so loved the world, provided us with the ultimate sacrifice.

154
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 He gave us his one and only son, Jesus, and he is the Lamb of God.

155
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 He removed the sin of the world, and he showed us his love by sacrificing willingly for every single one of us.

156
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And that's the gospel, right? But that is more than that.

157
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Yes, Jesus took care of the effects, the consequence of sin for eternity,

158
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 but just now we talk about the root problems, and here is it.

159
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 God didn't just take care of the consequence of sin when he reconciled us back to him through the atonement of Jesus.

160
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 He also sent his Holy Spirit to live inside of us.

161
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 The same Spirit that filled Jesus while he was walking on earth,

162
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 the same Spirit who had the resurrecting power to bring Jesus back to life,

163
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 the Holy Spirit can give you new life, a fresh start, and turn you into a new creation.

164
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 That's what we were talking about all throughout the whole Galatians series.

165
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 He turns us into a new creation, and you are no longer slave to sin, to the power of darkness,

166
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 to addictions, to self-harming or other harming thoughts and behaviors.

167
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 You can finally, or we can finally live the life the way that God has always intended for us to live,

168
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 the abundant life.

169
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 And with the Holy Spirit dwelling inside of us, what's even more exciting is that it means now you are the hot spot of God's presence.

170
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 In the old days, there was only one building on the entire planet where you can find the presence of God,

171
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 but now you, every single one in this room, I'm looking at hundreds of it.

172
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 We have more than a hundred portable, walking version of the temple of this kind of God's presence hot spot in this room.

173
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 We are carrying the presence of God. We're hosting the presence of God.

174
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 So that's why Paul said, "You know what? You, your body, is the temple of the Holy Spirit.

175
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 You guys are walking temples.

176
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 What the Israelites can only reach in a certain place, now it's everywhere because of what Jesus has done,

177
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 because of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.

178
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 It's not only a fixed location anymore.

179
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 You can find God anywhere, anytime.

180
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 He's not far, far away. He's not that judge who sits in the seats in an inapproachable light.

181
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 You cannot find him. He is closer than you could ever imagine.

182
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And he did all this, not because we deserve it, not because how good we are, how good looking or how, you know,

183
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 or behaving, we get all the A's and not because of that.

184
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 It's simply because he loves us.

185
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 In the Bible, we call that mercy.

186
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Mercy is not something we deserve.

187
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 The life you're living right now, maybe the love that you're enjoying, the peace you're enjoying,

188
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 the joy you have in your life, it's not because of what you have done or what we have done that we deserve it.

189
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 It's because of God's mercy for us.

190
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 He loves us so deeply that he's willing to pay the price on his own.

191
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 That's mercy.

192
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And so Paul, he said this in Romans 12 verse 1, he says,

193
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy,

194
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God.

195
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 This is your true and proper worship."

196
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Because of this mercy of God, let's offer ourselves to God.

197
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 This is a true and proper worship.

198
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 But let me highlight this phrase for a second, living sacrifice.

199
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 You probably have heard of or read this verse a hundred times before,

200
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 and this living sacrifice thing has just become a catchphrase for you.

201
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Maybe you don't even think about it anymore, or maybe you have done tons of Bible studies

202
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 or have heard tons of sermons on it, and your brain already starts to recall a lot of the definitions you've heard from the past.

203
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Maybe your time, your energy, your talents and gifts, your money, your relationships, everything.

204
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 That list just goes on and on.

205
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Just give all that to God. That's living sacrifice.

206
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 But hold on a second. I just want to, you know, just can I ask everyone to stop right now

207
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 if you have this list going on and on in your head.

208
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Can I just simply point out to you that how bizarre this phrase actually sounds like.

209
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 If you've been following what I was saying, you probably would notice that the fact that our sacrifice is dead.

210
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 They have to be dead in order to fulfill their purpose as a substitute.

211
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 If they're not dead, which is a living sacrifice, it literally means, you know, they're not doing their job.

212
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 They're not getting the job done. Are you following me?

213
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Yeah, but of course you already know the answer.

214
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 You know, you guys are, you know, you guys love Jesus.

215
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 You read the Bible and you know Jesus is the answer.

216
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 He's the one, he's the alternate substitute we've been talking about.

217
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 He sacrificed on the cross, got the job done once and for all period.

218
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Then so why Paul is using this kind of language here.

219
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Why does he still mention sacrifice or living sacrifice?

220
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I think he did it on purpose because according to Paul himself or other disciples,

221
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 when we give our lives to follow Jesus, we're supposed to be dead and alive at the same time.

222
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Let me say that again. When we give our lives to follow Jesus, we're supposed to be dead and alive at the same time.

223
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And you're saying Chapman, you're out of your mind.

224
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 You don't know what you're talking about. Let me read some scriptures to you.

225
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And just, there are actually tons of scriptures that I can read about this.

226
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 But since we're promoting the baptism class today, let me read this from Romans 6, verse 4.

227
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father, we too may live a new life.

228
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.

229
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body rude by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.

230
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.

231
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Now, if we died with Christ, we believed that we will also live with him.

232
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 We're supposed to be dead and alive at the same time as a Christ follower.

233
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So Paul is actually saying, as a response to God's mercy, to what he has done for you and me, for us, let's present to him our whole being, our entire being.

234
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And this being has already experienced death, our old self, which is our selfish intentions, our sinful desires.

235
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 They have been crucified with Christ on the cross and it's now completely dead.

236
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 But through Jesus and his resurrection, we're also alive in this new life he has given us.

237
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And here's the point, church.

238
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 In order to be truly living, we need to be at the same time truly dead.

239
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 In order to be truly living, in order to enjoy this new life, we have to be truly dead at the same time.

240
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 So that we want to enjoy this new life we found in Jesus, we had to put to death all those desires, habits, beliefs, ideas, lifestyles, practices, relationships that do not align with the will of God.

241
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 We have to leave them behind.

242
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So in the book, The Cost of Discipleship, Bonhoeffer actually said this.

243
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 He said, "When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die."

244
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And so this is true and proper worship.

245
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 If you're grateful for his mercy, if your heart is inspired by his love for you and you're responding in love, then offer yourself, your whole being to God.

246
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Make sure what should be dead stays dead.

247
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 So that the life of Christ could manifest through your being every single day.

248
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Our problem as Christ followers is normally this.

249
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 That today we know we have to be living sacrifice, but the thing is, the part that should be dead somehow pretty much survived, stayed alive, maybe got an IV, you know, kind of still alive.

250
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And the part that should be alive is kind of dead.

251
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Let me say that again.

252
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Our problem as Christians is that the part of us which should be alive is pretty dead, but the part that should be dead is quite alive.

253
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 That's our problem.

254
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 That's the thing that we're experiencing.

255
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And don't get me wrong.

256
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 I'm not here, I didn't come up to the stage here to emotionally blackmail anyone or to make you feel bad, to guilt trip you.

257
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 In the contrary, I want to confess to you as a fellow brother that I know what it means to experience that kind of tension, that kind of struggle.

258
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 I also wrestle with anger, bitterness, or even sometimes if I could use a stronger word, hatred, towards people whom I know I should have forgiven or I should learn to love them like Jesus loved them.

259
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 I know that.

260
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Sometimes I feel I'm so torn apart, I can't do it.

261
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And I know that there are times I should trust God and be generous, but I ended up worrying about myself and I just become selfish.

262
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 And I know that.

263
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 We're not pointing fingers at anyone here, but we need to look at this problem of the parts of us that should be dead but stay alive and the parts of us that should be alive but stay dead.

264
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 We should look into it.

265
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And sometimes I even feel in this world I'm a little bit encouraged to be a bit more selfish, to look after myself a bit more, or even to hate or to rationalize my self-serving behavior.

266
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Whenever I'm on social media, I see that.

267
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Sometimes when I watch a movie, you know, they say some very convincing things, "Oh, you know, everybody for themselves, they should look after themselves, blah, blah, blah, it's okay."

268
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Or when sometimes I talk to people, talk to friends, "Do you not follow Jesus yet?"

269
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 If we live in this world, we're fed with this kind of information that feeds the part of ourselves that should be dead.

270
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And it's killing the part that should be alive.

271
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 That's why Paul continued to set this in the passage.

272
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 He says, "If we want to be a living sacrifice, if we want to be truly dead to our old self and truly alive in Jesus, we cannot follow or conform to the pattern of the world around us.

273
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 We need to be transformed."

274
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I might have talked about this idea of transform, you know, from a caterpillar to a butterfly a while back.

275
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And that's the idea of transformation that is talked about in the Bible.

276
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And this whole transformation work was done by the Holy Spirit inside of us that God has given us.

277
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 He enabled us to be a real living sacrifice.

278
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Without the Holy Spirit, we don't even stand a chance when we're facing the power of the flesh.

279
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 That's in Galatians as well, this in the last couple of weeks as well.

280
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And if we don't have the Holy Spirit, we certainly don't have the power to live a resurrected life.

281
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 So my friends here, I bring to you these questions today, this morning.

282
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Are you truly dead?

283
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And are you truly alive?

284
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Where do you need to be a little bit more dead?

285
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And where do you need to be a little bit more alive?

286
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Where do you need the Holy Spirit to come, you know, and by His power transform you and bring about the changes in you so that you can offer yourself as a real living sacrifice to God as your true and proper worship?

287
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 That's the question that we all struggle a little bit, but by the grace of God, when His light come and enlighten us, I believe He will speak to us.

288
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And again, it's not just by us. Of course, it's by His Holy Spirit.

289
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 But then we also have to know this.

290
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 If you want to offer yourself to God as a real living sacrifice, if you want your life to be transformed to be more like Jesus, most of the time it costs us something.

291
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Don't get me wrong, salvation is free.

292
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Receiving and enjoying God's love, it's always free.

293
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Somebody has paid for it.

294
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 But when we respond to God's love and we try to love Him back, it's going to cost us something.

295
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Worship, it's going to cost us something.

296
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 And I want to close this message with a story in the Old Testament about a guy, David.

297
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 There are lots of stories about David, but there's one particular story in the First Chronicles.

298
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 The First Chronicles recorded stories of David of how he prepared to build the temple.

299
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 The temple was David's idea.

300
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 He didn't just love to worship God.

301
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 He wants to build a house to host the presence of God.

302
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 He says, "God, I want to build you a house so you can live there, so I can come here and spend time with you all the time."

303
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 That's his heart.

304
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 He wanted to build a house like that.

305
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And in First Chronicles chapter 21, there's a story about how David bought a piece of land where the temple would eventually be built.

306
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 But let me just give you a spoiler.

307
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 It's kind of a tragic story.

308
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 You can go back and read it yourself.

309
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 I don't have time to talk about it now, but I'm going to read a little bit to you.

310
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 I'm just going to read from First Chronicles chapter 21, starting verse 22.

311
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 So basically, let me just paraphrase this a little bit.

312
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 So he came to a guy who owned that piece of land, and he said, "I want this piece of land.

313
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 I want to build an altar to present a sacrifice to God."

314
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And that guy said, "Yeah, sure.

315
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 King, you're the king.

316
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Come on, just take the land."

317
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And this is what David said in verse 24 of the chapter.

318
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 He said, "No, I insist on paying the full price.

319
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Do not take for the Lord what is yours or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing."

320
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 What David is saying here is, "My worship is going to cost me something.

321
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 My worship should cost me something.

322
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 My love for God is measured by the sacrifice that I am willing to make today.

323
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Worship should cost us something."

324
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 You see here, David, he was preparing for the temple, that building to host the presence of God.

325
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 But Paul is saying here, he said, "In view of God's mercy, present your bodies.

326
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Present the body which should be the temple of the Holy Spirit to God."

327
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 When David was making preparation of that presentation, he said, "I'm going to pay for it.

328
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 I'm going to give something.

329
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 I'm going to pay a price.

330
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 There should be a cost for that."

331
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 So today, I believe when Paul is asking us to present ourselves, our bodies to God as his temple,

332
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 I believe that we also need to pay a price.

333
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 If we believe worship is about expressing our love to the King of kings, to the Lord of lords,

334
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 to the God, to our Father who loves us so much,

335
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 then this love is also measured by sacrifice.

336
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Our love for God can be measured by how much we're willing to give.

337
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 That's why Jesus asked Peter three times, "Do you love me, Peter, more than these?"

338
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 It can be measured by sacrifice.

339
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Our worship should cost us something.

340
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 What if the Vineyard Long, we're a church, as we gather every Sunday,

341
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 we don't just come in because the music is nice, because we have a band that plays good music,

342
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 and we feel good.

343
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 What if our worship here actually costs us something?

344
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 What if our worship actually goes beyond just singing some nice songs?

345
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 What if our worship involves being a living sacrifice,

346
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 meaning we try to find out what are the areas that we should stay at that,

347
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 and we make sure they are dead.

348
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And we find out the areas where we should be alive,

349
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 and we invite the Holy Spirit into that area,

350
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 and say, "Come, make me alive, Holy Spirit."

351
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 What if that's our worship?

352
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 What would this church look like?

353
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 What would Yuen Long look like if we have such a church in this city, in this area?

354
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 That's our worship.

355
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Our worship should cost us something.

356
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 We're about to enter a time of what we call musical worship again.

357
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 But I do want to invite you, my dear brothers and sisters, in view of the mercy of God,

358
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 let's come and give our whole self to Him.

359
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Let's start to be a living sacrifice.

360
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Can we have the band back? Thank you.

361
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Just now when we were worshiping, singing songs, I mean, during the service,

362
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 I just sat at the back there, and I was trying to ask God,

363
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 "Okay, God, could you, by your mercy, could you show me some things

364
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 that maybe I can share with my friends here,

365
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 that how we can learn to be a living sacrifice?"

366
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And I have a short list of things, and it probably won't cover everything,

367
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 and it may not be for you, but could you allow me to just read out?

368
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 And when I read out, can I invite you just maybe close your eyes,

369
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 and just invite the Holy Spirit?

370
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And if this is something that God is trying to speak to you,

371
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 you can respond to Him right there and say,

372
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 "God, if this is something I need to get rid of,

373
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 if this is something that should be dead in my life, help me to nail it on the cross.

374
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 God, if this is somewhere I need your power to move inside of me,

375
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 please come and give me that power to make me alive again."

376
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Why don't we just welcome the presence of God,

377
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 the presence that has already been inside of us?

378
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 He's closer than we have ever imagined, and He's here right now.

379
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And God, we honor You.

380
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 We love You.

381
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Father, we pray that hallowed be Your name,

382
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 that we may be a church that will really understand what it means,

383
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 that Your name will be hallowed in this community,

384
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 that we know what sacrifice really means, or living sacrifice really means,

385
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 that our lives can be transformed by the power of Your Holy Spirit,

386
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 so that we could be a holy, a pleasing sacrifice to You, Lord.

387
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And He could be some of the things that we could let go or give up or get rid of

388
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 or ask for God's help.

389
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 I have a sense that maybe some of us here, we need to take the first step

390
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 to reconcile with our family,

391
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 be the first one to forgive, even before they acknowledge they hurt you.

392
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 I sense that perhaps some of us, we need the boldness in our workplace

393
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 to witness or share our faith, that we need a breakthrough from fear.

394
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 And perhaps some of us, if you've been telling yourself if you have more financially,

395
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 if you have accumulated more, then maybe you will share some with those who are in need.

396
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 But I believe God is inviting you.

397
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 You don't have to wait until you have accumulated more.

398
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 You can share now. You can be generous now.

399
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 That's how you can be a living sacrifice.

400
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And I sense that for some of us,

401
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 being a living sacrifice simply means be present in your family.

402
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 And I believe some of us here, we have a calling and a gift of leadership,

403
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 perhaps in ministry, maybe in a CG, maybe in church, maybe outside of church.

404
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 I believe God is calling you to give yourself to serving.

405
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Yeah, there is doubt. Am I good enough?

406
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 God says let's nail down on the cross.

407
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 And maybe some of us, we have plans for our own life.

408
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 You have what you want for yourself, what you want for your family, your kids.

409
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 That too, if you hear the Holy Spirit speaking,

410
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 He could have invited you to, or He could be inviting you to nail that on the cross as well.

411
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 Maybe that's the part that has to stay that, or should be that,

412
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 so that the true abundant life, His plans for you could be revealed to you.

413
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 I believe there's so much more that God wants to say to us today here in this room.

414
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 This is a time with Him. He's here.

415
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 He loves to speak to us because of His mercy.

416
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 He wants us to have life and life to the fullness, abundant life.

417
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 Out of love, He wants to come and guide us and lead us and transform us.

418
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Let's respond to Him in your own way.

419
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 And after service, if you want to, we have the prayer team, we could pray for you.

420
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 But we're going to enter into a time where we use a song in response to that kind of love,

421
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 but it's not just about singing.

422
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 It's not just about moving the vocal cord to utter some lyrics out.

423
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 It's about opening up your heart, presenting your whole being to Him.

424
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 We're going to do that along with the music.

425
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 I love you.
