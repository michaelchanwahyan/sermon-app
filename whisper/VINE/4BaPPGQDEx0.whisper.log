[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500]   The Father says to you this morning,
[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.700]   "You are my child whom I love.
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.100]   "With you I'm well pleased.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.640]   "You are my child whom I love.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.100]   "With you I am so pleased."
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.300]   I feel like for some of us in this room,
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.500]   there's a counter thought,
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.820]   perhaps a counter narrative
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.520]   that the enemy has placed upon you.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.380]   You're not worthy to be a child of God.
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.380]   Have you looked at your life lately?
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.900]   Have you looked at your choices?
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.940]   Have you looked at your sin?
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.580]   He doesn't want you.
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.700]   He doesn't wanna be around you.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.700]   You're not deserving of his forgiveness.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.300]   You're a terrible person, unworthy of love.
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.000]   I wanna come against that alternative narrative now
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.740]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.700]   I wanna pour the blood of Jesus over anyone in this room
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.580]   who is coming today with a narrative
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.820]   that is not from the Lord, but from the enemy.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.860]   And while sin might be a reality for us,
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.020]   we are never cut off from a restored relationship with Christ
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.580]   through the forgiveness of sin.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.500]   Your own worthiness is never enough
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.620]   to bring you into the presence of Jesus.
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.420]   He chooses to step into your presence.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.660]   He chooses through the blood of Jesus shed on the cross
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.980]   and the resurrection of Christ for you.
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.700]   He chooses to step into your world
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.580]   and meet you in your brokenness, in your hurt,
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.340]   and in your harm, and in all the alternative narratives
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.420]   that are spoken over you.
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.960]   And he says, because of the blood of Jesus, you are worthy.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.460]   I love you.
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.860]   You are my child whom I love.
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.020]   With you I am well pleased and may never a word
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.620]   or never a voice say anything other to you.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.780]   You are my child.
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.060]   You're mine, my beloved.
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.320]   Father, I pray for the freedom that comes.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.080]   Through the wonder of the grace of Christ Jesus
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.160]   and the indwelling person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.560]   And Father, as we open up your word here today,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.680]   I wanna pray that love for anyone
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.080]   who's got those alternative narratives
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.320]   around their minds and their hearts,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.760]   that as we open scripture today,
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.200]   as we unpack the beauty of the Spirit of the Lord,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.560]   I wanna pray for that greater freedom.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.960]   I believe some of you in this room are gonna be released
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.600]   over the next 30 minutes or so.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.320]   Honestly, release.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.680]   (congregation applauding)
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.120]   Some of you in this room, it's been years,
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.520]   years of habitual brokenness in a certain area of your life.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.240]   We believe Exodus is the primary work of the Spirit of God.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.640]   And we pray for freedom like never before.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.920]   And we pray this in Jesus.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.880]   Everyone says.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.320]   (congregation applauding)
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.880]   Amen, amen.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.840]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.920]   So right at the beginning of this year,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.520]   in the very first devotional that we sent you
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.120]   as part of the fast that we did
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.560]   right at the start of this year,
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.800]   I said in that devotional,
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.240]   I wrote one of my dreams for this year.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.440]   And I said one of my primary dreams for this year
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.800]   is that the Vine would experience an even greater
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.480]   manifestation and ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.240]   And this has become something that we're longing for.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.360]   And as a leadership, we've been praying for deeply
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.760]   here at the Vine is that each one of us
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.520]   would experience a greater measure this year
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.280]   of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.760]   If you look throughout history,
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.080]   at ever the time when God calls a community of people,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.800]   a church or a group of people
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.040]   into a time of uncharted waters,
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.680]   which is what we've been saying God is doing
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.320]   here at the Vine in 2025,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.440]   when he calls people into uncharted waters,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.240]   what he's specifically doing is he's taking us
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.880]   out of our comfort zones.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.200]   He's placing us in a scenario and a situation
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.720]   where we have no roadmap, no strategy,
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.160]   no ability to be able to predict what's gonna happen.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.880]   It's literally uncharted waters.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.520]   In that environment throughout history,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.200]   whenever God does that in his people,
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.960]   he always brings, and there is always a need
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.160]   for a heightened sensitivity to the work
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.120]   and the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.800]   Because when we're in a place of out of our comfort zone,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.880]   we're no longer relying on our own strength.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.360]   We realize that we cannot, just like that word,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.400]   breathe in me 'cause I can't take breath
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.480]   unless you're involved.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.320]   We realize I cannot sort this out,
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.240]   I can't navigate the future
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.680]   unless your spirit reveals itself.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.440]   And so in these seasons, it is a season to lean in
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.920]   to the work and the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.960]   like never before.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.160]   And one of my great joys, if I look back
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.080]   over all the Sundays that have happened
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.160]   over the last beginning of this year to now,
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.400]   I can testify that we've been seeing this.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.440]   We've been seeing this increase of the ministry
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.400]   of the Holy Spirit amongst us.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.080]   And it's been profoundly beautiful in these gatherings,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.440]   but actually what the Holy Spirit is doing amongst us
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.360]   is even greater outside of what's just taking place
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.360]   in these 90 minutes on a Sunday.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.880]   We've been hearing testimonies of so many of you
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.680]   in your own individual journey with the Spirit
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.680]   and what the Holy Spirit is doing for you personally.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.520]   We've been hearing about marriages
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.360]   that have been transformed.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.080]   We've been hearing about broken relationships
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.200]   within families getting reconciled.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.000]   We've seen physical healings take place this year
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.600]   as people have prayed for people
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.000]   and they've received an immediate physical healing
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   for something that was ailing them.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.680]   And perhaps most profound of all,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.520]   and always the most profound work
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.800]   that the Holy Spirit ever does,
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.560]   last Sunday, where we were celebrating
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.800]   the death and resurrection of Jesus,
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.680]   we baptized 28 people down in Repulse Bay
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.080]   into the waters of baptism,
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.640]   coming out of the waters of baptism into new life.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.360]   The most significant work of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.960]   to bring people into a renewed relationship with Jesus.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.880]   Amen.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.280]   And I believe that what we're seeing
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.080]   and what the Spirit is doing is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.040]   It's just the first fruits of what He wants us
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.400]   to lean into for the rest of the year.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.520]   And I believe that there's gonna be an increase each week,
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.920]   an increase amongst us corporately,
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.280]   an increase amongst us individually
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.560]   of the manifest ministry of the Holy Spirit in our church.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   And I'm so glad that I'm the only person excited about that.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   Come on, church.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.680]   (congregation applauding)
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.800]   I honestly believe this.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.640]   Let me say this.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.600]   I honestly believe this.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.640]   I believe that the greatest manifestations
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.040]   of the Holy Spirit on earth are not behind us,
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.080]   they're ahead of us.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.240]   (laughing)
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.440]   Now, I'm not just saying that for claps, okay?
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.080]   I genuinely, honestly believe that.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.960]   And here's why.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.240]   I think as Christians, we can have this funny thing.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.680]   As Christians, we can kind of open the page of the Bible
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.120]   and we can see the work the Spirit does in Scripture.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.840]   And we can see what happens in the life
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.400]   of the ministry of Jesus.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.880]   And we see all these incredible things.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.720]   And it's almost like our primary posture
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.640]   with the Holy Spirit is one of nostalgia.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.960]   It's like, wow, look at that.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.520]   Oh, I wish I had been there in the first century.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.360]   I wish I had been there
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.480]   when the Spirit was so at work in the world.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.680]   Like, I wish I had been there
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.160]   when Jesus and Peter walked on water.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.640]   I wish I had been there when Jesus raised the child
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.720]   from death to life in the village of Nain.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.880]   I wish I had been there when handkerchiefs
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.760]   were just in the presence of Paul
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.280]   and they were taken and laid on sick people
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.200]   and they got well.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.840]   Man, if only I could have ever been in the time
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.360]   where the Spirit is at work.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.760]   And we can have this posture, right,
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.400]   with the Holy Spirit of nostalgia.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.280]   Like that the greatest moments of the manifestation
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.480]   of the Spirit on earth are in the rear view mirror.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.840]   That they've kind of happened in some time in the past.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.520]   Let me just break that myth with you right up front here.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.880]   The scriptures do not teach that the greatest moments
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.320]   of the Spirit are behind us.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.240]   In fact, Paul, writing to the church,
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.200]   trying to help them to build an expectation
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.760]   of what God's gonna do in their midst, he writes this.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.600]   He says the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.080]   Just pause there.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.120]   The greatest moments ever of the Holy Spirit
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.040]   at work in this world is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.360]   Because that's the moment where sin is defeated
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.760]   and reconciled relationship with God comes.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.760]   Never been a greater moment of the work of the Spirit
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.240]   in the world than the moment of the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.640]   And Paul says to the church, that same Spirit
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.420]   that did the greatest thing that none of us
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.920]   could ever achieve, he goes, that Spirit now lives in you.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.200]   He's like almost saying to the church,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.320]   like get your head around this.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   Like before Jesus' death on the cross,
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.600]   the Spirit was at work in the world.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.120]   The Spirit was externally manifesting itself beautifully
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.920]   in the moment of the cross and the resurrection.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.560]   He says, but it's no longer just out there in the world.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.840]   He said, now that Spirit lives in you.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.240]   It's like Paul is saying, don't you realize
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.080]   that everything changes now, that the indwelling power
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.240]   that raised Jesus from the dead can now raise you
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.520]   from the things that are dead in your life,
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.320]   from the things that are broken in you
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.040]   can now be manifested new life.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.600]   The things that you've never welcomed,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.760]   the sovereignty of the Lord can change in an instant
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.080]   'cause he raised a man from dead to life.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.640]   Imagine what he can do in your soul.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.120]   Imagine what he could do in your heart,
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.080]   he's saying to his church.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.840]   He's like, raise your expectation.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.080]   Jesus taught the same thing, didn't he?
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.640]   When he promises the Holy Spirit to the disciples
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.720]   in his resurrection, he says these beautiful things.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.240]   He says, you're gonna be able to do
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.720]   even greater things than I did.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.440]   This is not a theology that the best is in the past.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.600]   This is a theology of expectation in the church
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.840]   to begin to lean forward in the hope and the belief
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.800]   and the expectation that God is gonna do
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.640]   even greater things.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.120]   And so I wanna say this right over you here this morning.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.520]   The greatest work of the Holy Spirit
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.400]   is not in your rear view mirror.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.400]   Some of you in this room, that's what you feel.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.520]   You're like, man, I don't know if I would ever get back
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.800]   to that relationship I had with Jesus five years ago.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.000]   Some of you are like, man, I don't know
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.560]   if God's ever gonna manifest himself
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.520]   like I remember in my youth.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.680]   Let me say this to you.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.120]   The greatest relationship with the Holy Spirit
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.080]   is ahead of you, not behind you.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.720]   Oh my God, I'm so excited.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.520]   Now this is the reason, this is the reason
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.720]   why we're doing a seven-part series on the Holy Spirit
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.960]   starting today over the next seven weeks
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.600]   because I think it's so easy for us
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.760]   in a season of uncharted where we need to rely more
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.280]   on the Holy Spirit, it's so easy for us
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.680]   to have just one way of thinking about the Holy Spirit,
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.920]   like boxed in, if you will, to a certain way
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.080]   that we've always thought about the Holy Spirit
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.160]   and kind of summarize or think that all of the Spirit's work
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.960]   is just this one thing that we understand
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.200]   when actually the Scriptures provide
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   a very broad perspective on what the Holy Spirit does
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.040]   in this world.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.800]   And the reality is we can get so wrapped up
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.160]   in just the one thing because that's perhaps
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.240]   the one thing we've experienced.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.000]   When it comes to the Spirit of God in our lives,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.320]   we're so experiential as Christians.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.560]   And maybe the Holy Spirit's manifested itself
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.400]   in a certain way in your life in the past
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.360]   and that's become the primary way
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.760]   that you think of the Spirit and that's blinding you,
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.840]   perhaps, to some of the other ways the Spirit works
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.720]   that God wants you actually to be awoken to
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.200]   so that you can see the totality
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.600]   of what the Spirit is doing in your life.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.640]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.040]   But we're so logged in, I think,
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.200]   to how we've come to experience Him in the past.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.520]   I remember the first time I encountered the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.600]   I was four years old.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.880]   My parents at the time were involved
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.080]   in a very charismatic church in the south of England,
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.920]   like super charismatic, the kind of church
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.560]   where you walk in and you're like, what is going on?
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.400]   And on this particular day, my father responds
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.600]   to the word that was preached towards the end
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.640]   of the service and he responds and he goes forward
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.120]   for prayer and I remember as a four year old
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.560]   seeing the pastor and the pastor leans forward
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.160]   and just gently places his hand on my father's forehead.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.920]   My father starts to shake and then he collapses
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.880]   and he's as still as possible on the ground.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.880]   Now as a four year old, here's how I interpreted
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.640]   that moment, the pastor has killed my father.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.080]   [audience laughing]
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.560]   Like that's what I thought, the pastor has killed my father.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.240]   I start screaming and crying and like I'm throwing
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.320]   attention 'cause I think my father's dead.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.120]   My mom, here's this kid screaming, she runs over,
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.920]   she sees it's her son, she picks me up in her arms,
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.440]   she's like, what's going on, Andrew, what's going on?
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.920]   I'm like, the pastor's killed my father!
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.440]   And here's what she says, she says, oh no, no, no, no,
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.000]   no, no, no, dad's not dead, your father's not dead,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.200]   no, no, no, God's just speaking to him.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.240]   And here's what I thought as a four year old.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.880]   If that's how God speaks to people, I hope he never
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.680]   speaks to me for the rest of my life.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.760]   [audience laughing]
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.960]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.200]   But these dramatic moments of the Holy Spirit
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.920]   become so central and in that moment shapes so much
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.600]   of my theology, my thinking about the Holy Spirit
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.360]   and we can so hang on to the dramatic things
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.720]   that we see in the Spirit or read about in the Spirit
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.880]   or maybe have experienced ourselves and we actually
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.920]   don't allow ourselves to understand that the Spirit
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.760]   is so much more than just the magnificent and the dramatic
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.720]   that so often the work of the Spirit is imperceptible.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.640]   So often the work of the Spirit is actually happening
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.960]   within rather than externally.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.640]   So often the Spirit is doing more at chipping away
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.080]   my character and the things that are broken within me
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.360]   than perhaps he is miraculously healing somebody
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.720]   all of a sudden.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.040]   And yet we can get so caught up that we think,
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.280]   oh man, I wish it was back like the day of Acts
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.800]   because we're looking for the dramatic all the time
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.160]   when God is like, don't you realize that my Spirit
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   is doing more on earth today than it's ever done before?
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.560]   Don't you realize that people are changing
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.560]   and being transformed and being renewed like never before?
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.480]   And so I wanted to just say that this has been my journey.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.400]   Like I have experienced the dramatic in my life.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.200]   I remember a time when I was in the Philippines
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.960]   and a 14-year-old girl from our youth group
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.200]   prayed for this blind guy and he received sight
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.960]   right then and there before my own eyes, nuts.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.160]   I remember a time when my wife had a pain
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.480]   in the side of her rib cage and she'd had that pain
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.280]   for a long time and we were praying about it
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.040]   and I saw a picture of like a dagger
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.280]   in the side of her rib cage and I didn't know what to do
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.720]   and Chris was like, well just pull the dagger out.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.560]   And I'm like, weird, okay.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.320]   And I just kind of like went to the place
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.680]   where I thought the dagger was, pulled it out
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.880]   and she was miraculously healed,
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.040]   never had that pain ever again.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.720]   I remember a time where I was, this is crazy,
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.200]   where I spoke in another human language,
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.440]   one that I did not know because of the anointing
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.280]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.440]   Crazy story, I'll save that for another week.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.200]   I've experienced these dramatic experiences
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.560]   with the Holy Spirit but let me tell you this,
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.520]   after 30 years of being a Christian
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.520]   and 30 years of a relationship with the Holy Spirit,
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.980]   here's what's the most dramatic that has happened to me,
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.080]   the things that you perhaps would never know.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.120]   The fact that I can stand before you now 30 years later
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.360]   and say I'm more patient than I've ever been.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.280]   The fact that I know that I have more self-control
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.280]   over my temptations today than I did when I was in my 20s.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.800]   The fact that I can recognize that I've actually
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.160]   been strengthened in a way within me
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.000]   that I can withstand some of the criticism
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.360]   and feedback and stuff that happens
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.800]   when you have a public role like this
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.440]   in a reasonably large church in a big city.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   Like I know that there's things that the Spirit
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.080]   has done in me that is far greater
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.320]   than some of those manifestations that we said.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.640]   Not that they're bad and here's the point.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.200]   So often in our understanding of the Spirit,
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.920]   we choose one or the other.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.000]   Like we're either like, we're charismatic
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.360]   and everything's great and we wanna see the miracles
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.280]   and pray for a Bible or we're not sure
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.160]   if that happens anymore.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.600]   We're people who like to study the Bible.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.240]   Right, and we have these dichotomies
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.360]   between like it's either this or it's that.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.700]   Here's what the Scripture teaches.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.880]   It's not a choice between either or, it's a both and.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.400]   That we are ones who should long for and see
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.220]   and experience the dramatic ways
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.480]   that the Spirit is at work in us,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.880]   but we should also be expecting and leaning into
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.860]   those quiet, imperceptible changes of our character
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.600]   that happens within.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.240]   And it's this both and that we wanna teach you
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.000]   over the next seven weeks.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.280]   We wanna help you to wrestle with the reality
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.520]   that the Spirit is presented to us
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.060]   in a complex way in Scripture.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.800]   For example, He works in a community,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.360]   but He also works individually.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.680]   Or maybe this, He brings comfort and peace to us,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.680]   yet He also convicts and challenges us,
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.840]   which isn't very comfortable.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.440]   Or like He opens the Scriptures to us
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.960]   so we can understand God's Word
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.240]   from 2,000 something years ago,
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.280]   but He also speaks a rema fresh Word
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.200]   that's relevant to the day.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.480]   And this both and reality of Scripture
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.320]   is what we wanna open up to you over these seven weeks
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.180]   so that you, as you're in this season of unchartedness,
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.200]   can find yourself with a greater expectation
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.220]   of what the Spirit is about to do for us as a church,
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.320]   but also for you personally.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.840]   Is that helpful?
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.640]   And I wanna start that process today
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.720]   by teaching you a bit.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.320]   Oftentimes when I'm up here at front,
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.640]   I like to preach to you and tell funny stories
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   and yada, yada, yada.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.520]   Today I wanna teach.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.800]   I wanna unpack a couple of really deep biblical things,
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.680]   theological things that I think will help you
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.040]   as we begin this process of journeying more
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.520]   with the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.000]   And I wanna debunk a couple of myths about the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.860]   And then I want to give you the primary purpose
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.280]   of what the Spirit of God is doing on earth,
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.240]   why it is that we have the Spirit of God.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.640]   And because that primary purpose
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.320]   is what all the other both ands
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.240]   that we're gonna unpack throughout this series,
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.200]   they fit under.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.720]   They serve the reality of this bigger thing
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.200]   that I wanna unpack for you today.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.520]   Does that sound all right?
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.940]   All right, so let me debunk
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.080]   one of the most important myths straight away.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.440]   The primary way that Scripture speaks about the Spirit
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.240]   is as a person, co-eternal and co-existent
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.080]   with the Father and the Son.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.280]   That's the primary way that the Scriptures speak
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.240]   about the Holy Spirit, as a person,
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.580]   which is deeply challenging,
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:24.800]   because if you're anything like me,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.720]   I think we Christians really struggle with this,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.000]   'cause I think we can very easily have a concept
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.400]   that the Holy Spirit is largely like a life force
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.140]   or like some energy out there in the world.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.280]   Star Wars has ruined it for all of us, okay?
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.840]   And we think that the Holy Spirit
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.400]   is a bit like the force in Star Wars.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.840]   These are not the droids that you are looking for.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.680]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.560]   Like we can tap into some sort of life force
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.440]   or energy in the world to get superpowers,
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.080]   to do things that we couldn't do as normal humans,
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.520]   and that the energy and the life force,
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.120]   the Spirit is flowing out there somewhere,
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.480]   and we need to tap into it, access it for ourselves.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.760]   Making sense?
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.800]   Now, the reason why we do this as Christians
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.320]   is because the Bible doesn't really help us
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.540]   with this sometimes, 'cause the Bible presents the Spirit
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.680]   in these kinds of ways at times.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:17.560]   The metaphors of like wind and breath and fire and cloud
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.260]   and tongues of fire, all of these things describing
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.680]   who the person of the Holy Spirit is,
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.000]   and yet described in a language that kind of at times
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.960]   sort of strengthens our thought
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.320]   that the Holy Spirit is a force or energy in the world.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.600]   But the most important thing you need to do
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.920]   right at the beginning of this series
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.780]   is to understand that actually the Holy Spirit
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.840]   is not floating out there, some esoteric kind of thing
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.520]   that's like an energy to tap into.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.300]   The Holy Spirit is a person.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.040]   And this is very important because when you begin
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.320]   to understand the Spirit of God as a person,
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.220]   it actually revolutionized how you actually come
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.640]   into relationship with the Holy Spirit,
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.600]   how you treat the Holy Spirit,
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.020]   how you expect the Holy Spirit to work in your life.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.040]   If He's just some life force,
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.200]   you're constantly trying to tap into it.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.360]   If He's a person, you should be submitting to it.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.200]   Come on, church.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.360]   Now, Paul, who's perhaps one of the great writers
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.000]   of the Spirit in the New Testament,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.840]   Paul's theology of the Spirit is phenomenal.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.640]   I just pulled out, I went through the scriptures this week,
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.960]   and just pulled out a bunch of the ways
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.400]   in which Paul speaks of the Spirit,
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.640]   and how the Spirit, what the Spirit does.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.000]   So let me just show you this kind of slide here.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.200]   He counsels us to know the mind of Christ,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.640]   strengthens us in our weaknesses, intercedes on our behalf,
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.880]   teaches the gospel to us, leads us in the ways of God,
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.880]   grieved by our sinfulness,
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.040]   bearing witness with our own spirit.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.260]   Take a look at this.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.760]   These are not the things that you would describe
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.760]   to some life energy.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.360]   These are the things you would describe
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.680]   to someone who's a person, who's able to teach,
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.720]   able to pray, able to have emotions,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.040]   able to stand with us, grieving alongside of us.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.320]   I mean, this is a person.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.840]   This is describing the Spirit as a person.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.400]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.440]   Which is even more important when you begin
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.560]   to think of how Jesus predicted the coming
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.680]   of the promise of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.080]   Jesus in John 16, seven, He put it this way.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.480]   Let me read this to you.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.840]   He says, "I tell you the truth.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.520]   "It is better for you that I go,
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.240]   "for if I do not go, the advocate, the Holy Spirit,
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.280]   "will not come to you.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.240]   "But if I go, I will send him to you."
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.000]   Notice how Jesus describes the Holy Spirit as a person.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.360]   He doesn't say, "I will send it to you."
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.720]   He doesn't say, "Tap into this flow of the universe
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.240]   "and you'll be great."
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.560]   He's not trying to teach some new age philosophy here.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.280]   He's saying, "No, a person is going to come to you."
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   Now, here, debunk myth number two.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.040]   He describes Him here, which makes us think,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.160]   okay, well then maybe the Spirit is like a masculine thing,
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.400]   but actually the Spirit is not got a gendered body.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.720]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   So the Spirit itself encompasses all of human life.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   So it is both masculine and feminine.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.400]   It holds both of those things in its fullness.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.200]   So though Jesus uses a word here
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.040]   that probably just helped people to understand
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.400]   that a person is coming,
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.000]   I don't want you to get embedded into thinking
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.600]   that the Spirit is mostly masculine.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.120]   So there's this idea that Jesus says,
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.760]   look, it's right for you to have this experience
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.720]   with the person Spirit.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.680]   He doesn't just say that.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.600]   Notice what he says here.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.440]   He says, "It's better for you."
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.400]   Get your head around this.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.240]   He says, "It's better for you that I leave you
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.520]   "and send you the Holy Spirit."
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.800]   For Jesus, it was better for us
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.960]   to not have him in his bodily form,
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.640]   but to have the indwelling of the Spirit within us.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.000]   I don't know about you,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.720]   but that doesn't sound like a good deal.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.040]   Like, wouldn't you rather have,
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.880]   like, imagine if Jesus was standing in his bodily form
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.040]   right here, right next to me, right now in Hong Kong.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.120]   Revival would break out.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.800]   Would you not think so?
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.480]   But Jesus says, "It's actually better.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.760]   "It's actually better that I go
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.080]   "and that you experience the fullness
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.640]   "of what it's like to have one of the Godhead
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.960]   "living, dwelling inside of you,
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.640]   "turning your world inside out,
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.960]   "filling you with love and grace and power
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.320]   "and healing and mercy."
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.120]   Oh, he's saying, "It's so much better.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.280]   "I am here in my human form.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.200]   "I can only be here with you in this moment,
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.000]   "but when I go, one is gonna come
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.600]   "who's gonna be in all of you,
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.040]   "because greater are the things that you're going to do
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.040]   "and the spirit that is in you is the same spirit
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.400]   "that's gonna raise me from the dead," he says.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.200]   Now, this is wonderful, and it's important
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.680]   that we shift our thinking away
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.240]   from the Star Wars force of the spirit
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.760]   to the person of the spirit for this primary reason.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.080]   When you think of the Holy Spirit as a person,
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.920]   your immediate thought now is,
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.040]   how do I have a better relationship with this one?
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.480]   Person means communal relationship.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.520]   Spirit means tap into something out there.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.000]   Are you following this?
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.480]   Now, this is why when Paul writes to the church
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.720]   about the Trinity in one of the most beautiful times
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.720]   he does it in 2 Corinthians in 13, verse 14, he says this.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.960]   He says, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.200]   "and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.640]   "be with you all."
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.600]   Isn't that a beautiful prayer for his church?
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.400]   But notice, he chooses one word to describe
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.680]   each member of the Trinity,
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.800]   and it's almost like Paul is going,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.400]   "Okay, what's the best way I can describe each member?"
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.840]   He says, "Oh yeah, it's the grace of Jesus Christ."
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.080]   Well, of course.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.080]   Grace is the perfect way to describe Jesus
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.280]   because it's his grace that we are saved
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.360]   by what he did on the cross, the forgiveness of our sin.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.000]   He then says, "Well, it's love for the Father."
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.040]   Well, that makes sense 'cause the Father so loved the world
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.600]   that he sent his only son.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.880]   When it comes to the spirit,
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.560]   notice the word he uses, fellowship.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.040]   Like, he doesn't say like tap into, access,
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.960]   or just us to be filled with this kind of emotional feeling.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.720]   No, he said, "I want you to have the Greek word koinonia,
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.600]   "communion, togetherness with the person of the Holy Spirit."
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.400]   Our fellowship, our relational connection
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.120]   comes to the person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.320]   As that spirit is at work within us,
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.720]   we build that relationship with him,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.080]   and this koinonia flows out of us towards one another.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.600]   When he's saying the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.440]   what he's actually saying is
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   you have personal fellowship with him,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.360]   but then you have communal fellowship with one another
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.240]   through the spirit, and you might have different backgrounds,
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.240]   different life stories, different cultures.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.440]   You might have different traumas.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.760]   You might be wrestling with different things.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.400]   None of that matters because the spirit of God
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.800]   unifies us into togetherness.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.560]   The relationship we have with God
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:58.280]   through the person of the Holy Spirit changes everything.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:04.560]   Now, let me just summarize why this is an important shift
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.240]   in the way that we think, 'cause a lot of it comes down
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.680]   to how we're going to approach the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.200]   So let me show you this slide here.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.720]   On the left-hand side are the ways in which we would react
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.760]   if the spirit is predominantly a force
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.640]   or an energy to tap into.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.080]   Our question then is how can I access the spirit more
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.000]   so I can use it?
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.360]   I don't know about you, but I can put my hand up
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.640]   and say I've thought about the spirit that way a lot
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.480]   in my Christian life.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.240]   How do I access more of the spirit so I can use it?
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.840]   A better way of thinking about it
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.640]   when he's the person of the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.240]   how can I get to know the Holy Spirit more
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.400]   so he can use me?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.880]   Are you following this?
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.240]   It's a completely different way of being with the spirit.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.480]   One is like I need to tap in to gain
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.400]   the other is I wanna know so that I can become
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.120]   the best version of myself that I can be.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.560]   I wanna have a relationship so that everything can change.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.840]   Or let me show you another one.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.400]   So here's another one.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.960]   How can I get a hold of the spirit more?
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.280]   Like I've gotta try to get a hold of the spirit
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.560]   or I've gotta ask to kind of receive more and more
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.000]   like we wanna kind of ask the spirit of God
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.440]   to do something for us.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.400]   Notice on the other side when he's more of a person,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.520]   how can the spirit get a hold of me more?
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.680]   What a profoundly different approach that is.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.120]   Do you see why it's so important to shift our mindset
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.360]   about how we conceive of the Holy Spirit
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.680]   from this force and this energy towards a person, right?
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.520]   'Cause when he's a person, our primary posture,
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.600]   notice this, when he's not a person,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   our primary posture is control and access and use.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.400]   Doesn't sound very godly, does it?
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.320]   But when we see him as a person,
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.000]   our primary posture is what we were praying earlier,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.440]   submission, humility, worship.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.480]   And so as we begin this shift
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.920]   in the way we think about the Holy Spirit,
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.960]   we begin a huge shift in how we encounter
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.320]   and how we submit and how we open our lives
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.680]   to the work of the spirit around us.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.880]   Not a give me, give me, give me,
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.040]   but a make me, make me, make me.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.800]   Now, are you tracking with us so far?
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.520]   Let me try that one more time.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.320]   Are you tracking with us so far?
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.200]   Okay, I wanna now take it to a deeper level.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.640]   Let's go down a notch now towards the bigger purpose
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.880]   of what the Holy Spirit is.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.440]   He's a person to have relationship with
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.080]   so that we can shift from a give me to a make me,
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.720]   but why is that the case?
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.960]   What is it that the Holy Spirit
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.520]   is ultimately doing in our world?
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.720]   Well, to understand that, I wanna take you
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.080]   to a couple of passages of scripture.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.720]   I hope this has been helpful for you so far,
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.560]   but this stuff's gonna really open up, I think,
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.240]   for you a bigger understanding of what the Spirit
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.120]   is going to do in us and in our world.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.440]   The first time the Spirit is mentioned
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.640]   is in Genesis 1, verse two.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.720]   Let me read you the first two verses of the Bible.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.600]   Now, the earth was formless and empty,
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.480]   and darkness was over the surface of the deep,
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.320]   and the Spirit of God, notice this,
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.720]   the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.400]   The very first time we're introduced to the Spirit
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.160]   is in the second verse of the Bible.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.280]   First of all, we're introduced to the Father who creates,
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.040]   then we're introduced to the Spirit,
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.600]   and what we're told is that the world in that moment
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.640]   is this formless, dark void.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.680]   Other translations would say there was chaos over the deep.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.720]   Now, that would paint a pretty bleak picture
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.680]   right there at the beginning of the Bible,
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.280]   except for one thing.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.840]   Actually, what this is presenting to us
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.360]   is a picture of hope, and the reason there's hope
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.240]   is because of the Spirit.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.680]   Yes, the world was this dark, formless, chaotic void
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.680]   at the time, but it wasn't left alone.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.800]   There's the Holy Spirit, and how is he pictured
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.440]   so poetically and beautifully?
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.320]   Hovering like a bird over creation,
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.200]   longing to wanna see creation take life.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.480]   This hovering is a very unique Hebrew word.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.520]   It's only mentioned one other time in Deuteronomy
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.560]   where it's spoken about an eagle hovering
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.960]   over the nest of its young,
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.200]   hoping that the young would take flight.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.960]   That's the same concept here.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.840]   A bird hovering over creation,
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.000]   longing for that creation to find its life,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.960]   longing for that creation to come alive.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   Now, let me step back one second,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.760]   because this is the primary thing
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.840]   that the Holy Spirit does.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.120]   It brings things to life, but to understand that,
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.680]   you have to understand the Hebrew concept of life,
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.600]   which is different from how we in the West
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.920]   often think of life.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.520]   In the Hebrew concept of life, it's not just
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   about a heart beating and an ability to breathe.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.360]   In other words, it's not just about like, I'm alive.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.640]   The Hebrew concept of life was about the beating heart
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.800]   and the breathing, but it was also about fulfilling
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.440]   and becoming the greatest version of yourself
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.440]   that you can be, becoming fully as you were intended
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.760]   and created to be.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.160]   This is the call of what the Hebrews meant
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.640]   by something having life, not just breathing,
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.680]   but actually being fully how they were intended
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.440]   and designed to be.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.080]   So if I was gonna define the Hebrew definition of life,
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.040]   I would say this, having life is living to the best
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.760]   of our created intent.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.560]   Some of you should write that down,
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.560]   because that's actually gonna shape so much of your future,
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.040]   just that one thought, living to the best
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.320]   of your created intent.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.720]   In the Genesis narrative that we're looking at
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.000]   in this moment, this is the whole thing
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   that the Spirit is at work doing,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.440]   helping things go from a place of formlessness in creation
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.520]   to a place of not just being alive,
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.640]   but being just as they were always intended to be.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.520]   In Genesis 1 and 2, this is described to us as shalom,
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.720]   as the idea of wholeness and completeness,
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.200]   the fullness of the way things should be.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.240]   This is the definition of life.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.360]   And the way that the Holy Spirit is involved
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.520]   in bringing life, giving life,
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.400]   is not just helping us to breathe,
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.840]   but moving us towards the ways of intention
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.840]   of the heart of God.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.880]   And that progression, that movement,
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.400]   is the Spirit bringing us life.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.920]   So if that's the case, think of it this way,
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.680]   the closer that you are to being the person
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.120]   you were always intended to be,
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.920]   the closer you are to being fully alive.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.040]   Are you following this?
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.240]   The closer you are to being the person
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.800]   that you were always intended to be,
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.920]   the closer you are to being alive.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   This is the Hebrew concept.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.600]   Is that all making sense to you?
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.680]   Okay, so then we take that concept back to this passage
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.480]   where the Holy Spirit is hovering over a lifeless creation
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.160]   and he longs to bring it to life.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.920]   He longs to take what's formless
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.800]   and bring it into the fullness of this life.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.840]   And he does it with creation itself,
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.600]   but then there's this pinnacle of creation,
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.200]   the creation of humanity.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.240]   And I wanna show you what happens in that moment
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.360]   of the creation of humanity.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.440]   This is Genesis 2, verse seven.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.600]   "The Lord God formed the man," or formed humanity,
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.240]   "from the dust of the ground
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.800]   "and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.120]   "And the man," this was Adam in this moment,
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.600]   "becomes a living being."
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.040]   There's this beautiful moment.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.320]   I want you to see what God does.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.000]   He takes something that's formless,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.280]   the dust on the ground,
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.560]   he shapes a form of man,
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.960]   and then he brings that into the fullness of a living being
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.640]   by the work of the Spirit.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.480]   Does that make sense?
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.080]   So he breathes, that's one of the ways
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.080]   in which we come to think of and understand the Spirit.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.400]   He breathes over this formed thing
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.360]   and brings it into the fullness
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.320]   of what it was always designed to be.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.000]   This movement is a movement in Genesis 1 and 2
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.400]   from a work of disorder to a work of order.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.080]   See, the Holy Spirit's primary purpose
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.640]   is to bring things to life.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.320]   And the way that he does that
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.080]   is by taking things that are currently disordered
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.800]   and bringing them into order.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.400]   You should take a photo of that slide.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.120]   Because this shapes everything
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.120]   we're gonna do in the series ahead.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.200]   This is the work of the Spirit,
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.120]   taking something that is disordered
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:29.560]   and moving it into this place of great order.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.600]   This happens for creation,
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.440]   it happens for Adam.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.560]   But then I want you to see what happens later in the story.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.920]   Because later on in the story,
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.400]   of course we have sin that enters in chapter three.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.640]   By the way, I want you to notice something.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.840]   This is quite cool.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.520]   The purpose of the Holy Spirit
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.000]   to bring things from disorder to order
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.800]   happens before the fall of humanity.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.480]   In other words, his nature is not driven by sin,
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.360]   but by love.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.480]   Oh, come on.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.800]   Like before there was sin,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.720]   the Spirit of God was already at work
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.520]   taking disorder to order.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.000]   Taking things that were formless to form to fullness.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.600]   Now sin heightens that work
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.760]   that the Spirit of God is going to do.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.600]   And it heightens it
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.080]   because this is the very nature
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   of the Spirit from the beginning.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.720]   To out of love,
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   wanna see things into their fullness
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.960]   just as they were created to be.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.000]   This all culminates in our biblical story
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.840]   with the person of Jesus.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.480]   And as Jesus steps into his role
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.680]   as a rabbi and a prophet and a teacher,
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.200]   and of course the Son of God,
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.520]   something significant happens in the narrative.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.640]   Let me jump forward to Luke chapter three
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.560]   who provides a beautiful picture of this for us.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.440]   Luke chapter three,
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.600]   this is the very beginning of Jesus
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.120]   stepping into his ministry.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.640]   It happens at his baptism.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.120]   Luke three starting verse 21.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.160]   When all the people who were being baptized,
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.240]   Jesus was baptized too.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.920]   And as he was praying, heaven opened.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.760]   Notice this.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.880]   And the Holy Spirit descended on him
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.800]   in bodily form like a dove.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.080]   And a voice came from heaven and said,
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.200]   "You are my Son, whom I love.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.720]   "With you I am well pleased."
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   I want you to notice this.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.320]   At the beginning of creation in Genesis one and two,
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.080]   there's disorder and chaos in the world,
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.120]   but there's hope
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.280]   because the Holy Spirit is hovering over creation.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.000]   Interestingly, in the Aramaic version of the Old Testament
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.120]   that was basically the one that was read
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.680]   during the time of Jesus' ministry,
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.160]   Jesus and the disciples largely spoke Aramaic than Hebrew.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.680]   In the Aramaic version called the Targum,
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.680]   the actual word in Genesis one and two is the word dove.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.640]   A dove floating over the disorder of creation,
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.600]   waiting to bring it into the fullness of life.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.240]   Fast forward to his baptism,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:47.040]   people see a dove descend down on Jesus.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.520]   In other words, what's happening here
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.720]   is God is basically saying a new creation moment
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   is taking place in this person.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.760]   Like I'm about to do something through the life, death,
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.560]   and resurrection of this one person
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.760]   that is literally like a new creation moment.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.600]   In the old creation with sin, everything fell into disorder,
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.760]   but in the new creation with Jesus,
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.080]   what is disordered is gonna come back into order.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.000]   What is broken because of sin
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.040]   is gonna find redeemed life in the forgiveness
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.000]   and the reconciliation that Christ will do on the cross.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.800]   And this is signified by this moment of the dove again,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.280]   the spirit saying what is disordered in this world
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.760]   will be brought to order because of this one person.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.280]   Still tracking?
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.880]   Now, last week at Easter,
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.640]   the death and resurrection of Jesus,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.640]   we celebrated, didn't we, this amazing moment
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.280]   where Jesus in his resurrection appears,
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.800]   the tomb is empty,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.240]   and the burial shroud has been set aside,
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:47.000]   and then Jesus appears to his disciples in John chapter 20.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Let me read this to you.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.840]   This is pretty cool.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.280]   In John chapter 20,
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.800]   this is the first time Jesus shows himself in resurrection
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.640]   to his disciples.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.240]   In verse 21, he says this.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.440]   Again, Jesus said, "Peace be with you.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.520]   As the Father has sent me, I am now sending you."
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.320]   And with that, he breathed on them and said,
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.280]   "Receive the Holy Spirit."
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.160]   Does that remind you of anything?
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.600]   So get your head around this.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.920]   Adam formed out of the chaos of the ground,
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.840]   formed into the shape of man.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.240]   God breathed on him,
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.720]   so what was disordered would come into order
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.960]   and life would come,
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.280]   not just life in order to breathe,
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.040]   but life as the Hebrews defined it,
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.720]   the fullness of what it could be
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.440]   as its original created intent.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.880]   Now in the resurrection,
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.160]   Jesus shows up to the disciples
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.680]   who have so much brokenness within them,
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.520]   who are struggling with the reality
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.480]   of whether Jesus was the Messiah or not,
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.680]   and he's just had this creation moment,
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.520]   new creation moment.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.600]   He then breathes over them,
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.120]   just like God breathed over Adam,
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.840]   he breathes over the disciples.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.400]   And what he's communicating that is he's saying,
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.520]   "Receive the Holy Spirit."
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.400]   In other words, my desire for you
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.440]   is that you would now come fully alive,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.640]   that you would now become the versions
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.720]   that God has always intended you to be.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.360]   Because I've defeated sin,
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.960]   because death no longer has the final say,
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.560]   you now can find life.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.680]   And not just any kind of life,
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.320]   but the Hebrew defined life,
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.400]   where the Spirit is at work in you,
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   taking you from disorder to a place of order,
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.200]   dealing with the sin and the brokenness that's within you
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.800]   and building you into redeemed life in Christ Jesus.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.040]   You see that?
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.080]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.760]   That the Spirit of God, the person of God,
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.980]   is breathed into us at the moment of our salvation
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.720]   so that we can go into the fullness
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.720]   of how we were always intended to be, alive.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.680]   Now I want you theologically,
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.760]   just to stick with me one moment,
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.480]   as I theologically just explain this.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.280]   In the incarnation, God stepped into the disorder
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.200]   of this world and through the Holy Spirit
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.040]   made everything just as it was intended to be.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.600]   Does that make sense?
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   Now, in the same way, Jesus Christ steps into the disorder
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.180]   of our internal worlds and through the person
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.240]   of the Holy Spirit makes everything
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.160]   just as it was intended to be.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.680]   So what happens for the whole of creation
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.800]   in the incarnation now happens for us individually
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.920]   in the incarnation of Christ through the Spirit
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.640]   in the indwelling personhood of the Spirit in us.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.420]   What was disordered in all of creation,
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.240]   what is disordered in all of us,
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.000]   is now brought into the fullness of its order
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.840]   through the work of the Spirit.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.520]   Are you following me?
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.240]   So what does this mean for us?
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.200]   Well, it means everything.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.800]   It means that all of that disorder that we are aware of,
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.280]   the hurt, the brokenness, the pain, the sin,
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.600]   the trauma that's been done to us,
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.760]   the things that we deeply wrestle with,
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.680]   the realities that we understand
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.760]   that there's darkness and chaos still within us,
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.820]   the stuff that no one else sees that we bury behind,
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.400]   the places that we haven't even invited Christ into,
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   all of those things, God would say,
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.640]   I've placed the person of the Spirit in you
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.080]   so that whatever is currently disordered,
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.800]   that does not define you.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.760]   'Cause the work of the Spirit is always to take things
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.480]   that are disordered and to bring them into order.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.080]   So when we say, Lord, more Holy Spirit,
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.840]   what we're actually saying is I need more order.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.560]   I need to become the very person
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.560]   that I was originally created to be.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.360]   This is the way that in the New Testament
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.680]   begins to speak of this work of the Spirit amongst us
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.240]   and I wanna show you one final slide
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.920]   to help pull this all together for you.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.000]   This is the work of the Spirit bringing disorder to order.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.440]   So the Scriptures tell us that the Holy Spirit
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.480]   brings us to faith in Jesus, helps us to know Jesus better,
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.520]   restores our relationship with the Father,
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.880]   drives us into mission and justice,
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.440]   binds us together as the body of Christ in unity,
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.200]   empowers our living worship and discipleship.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.920]   All of this is what the Holy Spirit now does
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.120]   in that indwelling disorder to order reality in our lives.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.240]   And here's the important thing.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.680]   This is a cyclical thing that happens in us at all times.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.120]   And there might be seasons where one of these
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.880]   becomes more prominent for us,
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.080]   but the Spirit of God is at work in us at all times,
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.960]   bringing us into a greater place of order.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.840]   And I think sometimes we think it's like,
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.720]   I'm just gonna do step one, step two, step three,
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.800]   and then I'll get my certificate
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.400]   to say I'm a great Christian.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.680]   We in Hong Kong love that, don't we?
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.720]   Give me the linear thing that I need to do
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.960]   to get the certificate that it says I've done it.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.480]   That's not the way the Spirit works in our lives.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.240]   There's a chipping away and a change within us
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.720]   that takes time sometimes.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.320]   But as that work of the Spirit happens,
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.760]   the disorder over years becomes order.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.520]   And this is how we're gonna break down our series with you.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.760]   This is the final part of the slides.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.600]   You can take a photo of this if you'd like,
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.240]   but these are the six, seven weeks that are ahead of us,
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.000]   the six weeks ahead of this week,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.320]   where we're gonna each week break down
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.920]   one of these elements for you
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.960]   and help you to understand how the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.640]   changes the bigger picture of everything in our lives.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.120]   Is that helpful?
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.840]   Okay, I wanna finish with two questions
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.240]   that I want you to wrestle with this week.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.360]   This is our homework this week.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.960]   Come to church for homework.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.800]   It's great.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.640]   But these are two questions that I want you to sit with
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.880]   and wrestle with personally in the week ahead.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.000]   Okay, here's the first question.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.360]   If the person of the Holy Spirit
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.320]   is someone to be in fellowship with,
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.440]   am I actively cultivating a vibrant
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.440]   and personal connection with him?
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.560]   Do I see him still more as a force or energy to tap into
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.720]   than a person to walk with?
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.520]   Okay, I want you to do some wrestling with that
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.880]   in your own quiet time in the week ahead.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.720]   And the second one is this.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.520]   If the work of the Holy Spirit is primarily
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.280]   to take things that are in disorder
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.320]   and bring them into order,
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.040]   what is currently still in disorder in my life?
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.040]   Where do I need to invite the Holy Spirit
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.280]   to enter and reorder?
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.520]   Helpful?
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.600]   All right, can you stand with me?
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.040]   I would love to pray for you.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:16.640]   Maybe you'll be open to that posture
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.320]   of just humility and openness
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.160]   by opening your hands once more before the Spirit of God.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:27.680]   Father, we stand before you as the Vine Church
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.800]   in this season of uncharted waters,
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.960]   desperate to deepen our relationship,
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.840]   our fellowship with the person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.960]   Father, I pray for each person here,
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.880]   for the journey that they're on over the next seven weeks.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:47.080]   Lord, I thank you that you are going to be helping us
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.960]   to understand the both end of you,
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:54.720]   the dramatic things that perhaps we're most aware of,
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.160]   and the quiet things that you're doing within us
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.760]   that perhaps even right now we're not aware of.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.120]   Lord, I pray over this series
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.440]   that you would help each person in this room,
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.880]   those watching online now, those in our overflow,
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.200]   be strengthened in their understanding of the Spirit,
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.640]   and therefore strengthened in their inner person.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.800]   Lord, for any of us here where we would admit
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.160]   that our primary way of thinking about the Spirit
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.920]   is mostly like a force or an energy,
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.040]   and not a person, Lord, would you help us this week
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.880]   to recalibrate the way in which we think,
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.800]   to engage in a different way of worship,
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.520]   to understand that our posture
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.320]   is not one of tapping in and gaining.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.680]   Our posture is one of knowing and submitting.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.560]   And Lord, I pray that that would be important
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.720]   for some of us in this room
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.320]   at the beginning of this series.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.880]   Lord, I wanna pray for the disorder
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.440]   that I know that is still in my life,
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.880]   and the disorder that I'm sure
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.200]   is in every person's life in this room.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.080]   Lord, we thank you for where you've already taken us
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.480]   by the work of your Spirit.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.560]   We thank you for the ways in which we are better people
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.640]   than we were a year ago, two years ago, five years ago.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.920]   But like we started this time,
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.400]   we speak against the narrative of the enemy
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.560]   that would try to constantly keep us
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.400]   away from the progression of healing
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.760]   that the Holy Spirit is doing in us.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.800]   And Lord, I wanna pray that any areas of disorder
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.720]   you would awaken us to in the next seven weeks.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.880]   And I pray, Lord, that as your Spirit convicts us
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.720]   of some of the areas of our lives
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.480]   that we haven't fully submitted
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.840]   to the sovereignty of the Lord Jesus,
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   Lord, that we would do so in grace and expectation and hope.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.440]   I thank you, Lord, that there is no condemnation
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.480]   in Christ Jesus, but there is conviction
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.920]   by the kindness of the Spirit of God.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.240]   And Lord, I pray that if any of us need
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.320]   that conviction of your Word,
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.540]   Lord, that we would be humble enough
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:55.560]   to submit ourselves to the reordering
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.840]   that you wanna do in our lives.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.520]   Lord, I thank you for the freedom that is coming.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.880]   Lord, I thank you that what is ahead of us
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.160]   is greater than what is behind us.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.520]   I thank you that that same Spirit
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.520]   that raised Jesus from the dead is in each one here.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:18.640]   And Lord, in that, would you come and have your way
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.200]   and have your being?
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.140]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.940]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.400]   Let's worship together.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.900]   (congregation applauding)
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:39.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
