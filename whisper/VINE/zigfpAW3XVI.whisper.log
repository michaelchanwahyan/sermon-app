[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   So if I was to ask you in your life,
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.100]   when you have felt closest to God,
[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.680]   when you felt the most profound encounter with his presence,
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.160]   I wonder today what you would say to me.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.660]   Would you tell me about those best moments of your life?
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.120]   Those moments where everything was going great,
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.080]   where life seemed so amazing, where all the stars aligned,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.920]   where everything was perfect for you?
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.300]   Or I wonder whether you would tell me about the hard times.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.660]   You would tell me about the times
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.420]   where you actually realized
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.140]   that you had come to an end in yourself.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.580]   The times where you were so desperately in need of God.
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.100]   The times where you were literally
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.480]   in a situation of life and death,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.480]   that if God didn't step in,
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.060]   things would disrupt and fail for you.
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.220]   I wonder if it would be in the hardest moments
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.140]   that you have actually felt the closest to him.
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.860]   As I was reflecting on that question for myself this week,
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.940]   I was surprised by my answer.
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.260]   As I look back over this first 10 years
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.140]   of my time on staff here at the Vine,
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.940]   I know that the times that God has been closest to me,
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.780]   the times where he's manifested his presence most to me,
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.060]   have been in the hardest moments of ministry
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.020]   and the times where my skills and my talents and my gifts
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.020]   were not adequate for that moment
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.580]   that I was facing in ministry.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.140]   I remember the time where God's presence came upon me
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.940]   in the power of his peace,
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.940]   when I walked into a room to a crying mother
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.580]   who was holding her son
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.980]   who had just passed away in her arms.
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.780]   I remember feeling this incredible gift of words of wisdom
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.340]   when I was sitting with a family
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.020]   who were dealing with the travesty of the reality
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.920]   that their daughter had just passed away.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.340]   I remember this moment
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.980]   where I was actually woken up at three in the morning
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.020]   by a phone call from one of our congregation members
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.420]   and they had just discovered
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.380]   that their spouse had cheated on them.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.540]   And I felt at the time that I had nothing to offer.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.540]   And then a gift of the word of hope came upon me.
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.140]   I was to be able to share a scripture
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.260]   I hadn't thought of for years with her
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.500]   that really brought to life something in her spirit.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.580]   I remember the strength,
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.880]   the supernatural strength that came upon me
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.920]   when I sat next to my father at his deathbed in the hospital
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.300]   when cancer was taking his life from him.
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.780]   I remember that moment of God's intimacy with me
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.260]   when I stepped up that mountain in Santa Fe,
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.320]   when I was at such war with myself and with him.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.060]   And I walked into this moment of fog on the mountain
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.980]   and I heard God speak to me again.
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.340]   Yeah, it's in the hardest times of my life.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.900]   It's in the times where I felt least adequate,
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.780]   least with the amount of ability
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.220]   where I desperately needed God to speak
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.060]   or I've actually encountered his presence the closest.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.900]   God has been most real when I have been most barren.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.460]   - And we're stepping now into our second week of Advent
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.580]   and we're continuing our series
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.900]   on the ministry of John the Baptist.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.720]   And we move today from the call of repentance from last week
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.820]   to the place of repentance this week, the desert.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.800]   And when we think about John's ministry,
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.180]   it might surprise us that after 400 years of silence,
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.380]   that God would decide to speak again
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.980]   in a place like the wilderness, in a place like the desert.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.860]   It seems surprising and strange to us
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.860]   that that's where God's word would come from,
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.340]   the Judean wilderness, a place of hostility,
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.760]   of dark expansion, a place with really nothingness,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.100]   of hills and valleys, of rocks and sand,
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.080]   that that would be the place that God would choose
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.040]   to manifest his presence again with his people.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.700]   Last week, we looked at the story of John the Baptist
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.140]   from the gospel of Luke.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.380]   Today, I wanna open up at you that story
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.700]   from the gospel of Matthew.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.260]   And I wanna show you particularly how Matthew introduces us
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.620]   to this place of repentance
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.660]   and the role that the desert plays
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.940]   in our understanding of Advent
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.380]   as well as our preparation for Jesus.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.720]   So this is from Matthew chapter three.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.180]   I'm gonna start in verse one.
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.980]   In those days, John the Baptist came preaching
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.820]   in the desert of Judea and saying,
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.500]   "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah,
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.980]   a voice of one calling in the desert.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.340]   "Prepare the way for the Lord,
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.460]   make straight paths for him."
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.540]   John's clothes were made of camel's hair
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.180]   and he had a leather belt around his waist.
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.760]   His food was locusts and wild honey.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.480]   People went out to him from Jerusalem and all of Judea,
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.060]   the whole region of the Jordan, confessing their sins,
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.540]   they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.820]   But when he saw many of the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.860]   coming to where he was baptizing,
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.060]   he said, "You brood of vipers,
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.580]   who warned you to flee from the coming wrath,
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.620]   produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.540]   And do not think that you can say to yourselves,
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.500]   we have Abraham as our father.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.720]   Let me tell you that even out of these stones,
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.160]   God can raise up children of Abraham.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.580]   For the ax is already at the root of the trees
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.620]   and every tree that does not produce fruit
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.180]   will be cut down and thrown into the fire."
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.460]   Last week, I shared with us this moment
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.980]   where Luke opens up his account of John the Baptist
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.500]   and Luke does this weird thing.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.660]   He mentioned seven political and religious leaders
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.460]   'cause he wanted to say something important
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.460]   about what Advent meant for the people.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.500]   Well, Matthew in a very similar way
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.260]   does something similar here.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.580]   He actually mentions the place of John's ministry
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.800]   three times, he repeats it three times.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.420]   Right there at the start, he says,
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.060]   he comes preaching in the desert place.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.540]   Just a little bit on, he says,
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.140]   he's a voice of one calling from the desert.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.980]   Further on, he says that all the people
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.660]   would come out from where they were and come out to him,
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.020]   inferring that they were coming out to him in the desert.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.720]   Matthew wants you to know
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.300]   that one of the core characters of Advent
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.800]   and of John's ministry is this character of the desert,
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.380]   of the wilderness.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.820]   He wants us to understand why the wilderness was important,
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.040]   why Israel had to come out of the comfort of their cities,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.820]   the comfort of where they lived
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.980]   and had to move to a place of great barrenness
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.740]   in the Judean wilderness.
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.220]   A few years ago, I had the great privilege actually
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.060]   of traveling to the Holy Land.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.140]   I spent a couple of weeks actually in Israel
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.420]   and in Palestine.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.140]   I journeyed through all of the area of Galilee.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.980]   And one place that I really wanted to go to
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.200]   and spend some time in was the Judean wilderness.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.080]   I wanted to put myself in that place
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.740]   and experience a little bit of where it was
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.260]   that John the Baptist did his ministry.
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.940]   I wanted to put myself in the place
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.100]   where Jesus would be called by the Holy Spirit to go to,
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.540]   to be tempted by the enemy for 40 days and 40 nights
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.860]   in the same way that Israel had been brought out of Egypt
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.980]   into a 40 year journey in their wilderness.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.300]   I wanted to sit in the starkness and the barrenness
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.620]   of the Judean landscape to learn something of what it is
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.780]   that places such importance in the heart of God
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.020]   to such barrenness.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.900]   And I thought one of the great things to do today
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.420]   as we move into this idea of the place of the wilderness
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.540]   is actually to take you to the Judean hills today.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.220]   And so we filmed a little film whilst we were there
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.440]   to help all of us understand what Advent truly is
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.420]   and what the ministry of John the Baptist
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.860]   was actually like.
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.780]   So I wonder whether you would come with me now
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.700]   as I take you to the desert place of the Judean wilderness.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.740]   The wilderness is the mark of the land of Israel
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.120]   and it continues to surround much of its major cities today.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.460]   Barren, expansive, hostile and stark.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.100]   It has largely been uninhabited throughout their history.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.200]   Consequently, this has meant that this land here
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.580]   is an ideal place for seeking refuge from their enemies
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.460]   or retreat from the world around them.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.880]   From the call of Abraham to the journey of Moses,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.620]   to the release from Egypt, to the return from exile,
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.780]   the story of Israel has always been a story
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.440]   of God moving his people in and out of the wilderness.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.020]   (gentle music)
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.760]   (birds chirping)
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:43.140]   While the wilderness was never an easy place
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.420]   for the nation of Israel,
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.300]   it was a place where they could come to expect to meet God.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.720]   See, it took people out of the ordinary of their lives
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.940]   and brought them into a place
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.800]   where everything got stripped away.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.780]   A place where they were able to look at their lives afresh.
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.820]   The wilderness was God's way
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.980]   of getting his people's attention.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:11.300]   Well, it was in this place
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.700]   that God began to form Israel's core identity.
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.100]   And it always was a process that began
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.780]   with a strong call to repentance.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.700]   You see, the Old Testament had finished on a clear note
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.980]   that it was Israel's sin that had led them into exile
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.740]   and that their repentance of sin
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.660]   released them back into Jerusalem.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.220]   Now, some 400 years later,
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.960]   God renews the prophetic call for Israel
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.580]   to move into the wilderness
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.940]   through the ministry of John the Baptist.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.100]   And that would have communicated one clear thing to them,
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.440]   that God was about to redeem his people again,
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.600]   but it needed to begin once more
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.440]   with a call to repentance of sin.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.980]   John knew that his water baptism
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.260]   came before a more significant baptism
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.220]   of fire and the Holy Spirit that Jesus would perform.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.260]   This fire is Jesus's judgment on the world's sin.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.780]   He's come to liberate the world from this sin,
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.980]   once and for all,
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.420]   and that requires a sobering examination of our hearts.
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:21.060]   But John also knew something else.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.540]   You see, God brought his people into the wilderness,
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.340]   not because he was angry with them,
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.380]   but because he actually wanted to go deeper
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.260]   in relationship with them.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.860]   You see, far from being a place of punishment,
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.460]   the wilderness was actually a gift for God's people.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.780]   It was a place where God could clear out
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.220]   all of the stuff that had accumulated in people's lives.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.780]   You know, the fact is when we go through life,
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.140]   we pick up things all the time,
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.420]   things that begin to kind of weigh us down,
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.100]   the daily struggles of life.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.400]   And God brings us into a wilderness season
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.940]   so that he can lay these things down
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.000]   in the barrenness of the place,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.860]   where he can open us up
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.280]   so that he can deal with these things.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.740]   And God's heart is to basically burn them up
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.300]   in the wilderness place so that new life can begin.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:22.420]   - Luke links John the Baptist
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.060]   with the prophetic hope of Isaiah,
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.180]   where Isaiah declared that one would come
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.340]   to prepare the way for the Lord.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.980]   So as Luke introduces us to John the Baptist,
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.140]   he does so with great fanfare.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.580]   You can almost sense the excitement that Luke has
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.020]   as he writes, "This is the one who would prepare the ground
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.060]   "for our coming savior."
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.620]   John uses two metaphors to speak of Jesus.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.980]   He speaks of him as a fork and as fire.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.540]   And then he uses this picture of wheat and chaff.
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.860]   And he says that Jesus is going to be like a winnowing fork
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.860]   that separates wheat and chaff.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.620]   And then he's gonna be like a fire that burns up that chaff.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.620]   And what John does essentially right at the beginning
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.060]   of the story of Jesus is introduce us
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.980]   to one element of Jesus's life
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.660]   that we don't often talk about,
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.460]   the fact that he's not just a savior, he's also a judge.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.060]   (gentle music)
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:41.340]   - A fire in the wilderness is a welcome sight.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.380]   It's light breaks into the blanket of darkness around you.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.660]   You know, in our current culture of constant access
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.140]   and nonstop media, a time in the wilderness
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.580]   can actually feel a little bit like a curse from God,
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.820]   but it's actually anything but.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.500]   When we are invited into the wilderness by God,
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.300]   it's because he wants to bring us near
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.500]   to the burning presence of his Holy Spirit.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.700]   And it's in that Holy Spirit that our pain and our hurt
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.340]   and our brokenness is burnt up and dealt with.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.100]   In the wilderness, we come to see God
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.740]   gloriously, beautifully, holy.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.140]   And in the midst of that,
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.020]   get to see ourselves as humans fully alive.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.620]   (gentle music)
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:38.420]   - Us, humanity, fully alive.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.260]   I don't know about you,
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.780]   but I don't know if that's how I feel
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.520]   in the wilderness experiences that I've had in my life.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.600]   We all have them, don't we?
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.440]   These times of desert experience,
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.980]   where it feels like everything of comfort
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.580]   is removed from our lives.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.900]   It feels like that presence of God is taken away from us.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.300]   It feels like life is just hard work every single day.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.260]   I think the reality is,
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.100]   is that 2020 has felt like that for us as a year.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.820]   It feels like this whole year
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.100]   has been like a wilderness journey,
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.420]   where it feels like all the things
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.860]   that we've relied on before,
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.060]   the freedoms that we've had and the comforts we've had,
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.020]   the normality that we've had, it's been taken from us.
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:16.900]   I know for many of us,
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.340]   this is gonna be a different Christmas
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.220]   than we've experienced in the past.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.500]   Perhaps your loved ones are not able to travel
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.820]   to be with you here in Hong Kong this Christmas,
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.940]   or you're not able to travel to go be with them.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.220]   2020 has felt like a changing year
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.220]   where things are taken away from us
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.900]   that we would rather have,
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.340]   like we've been placed in this position of wilderness.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.020]   Could it be though,
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:45.220]   that just like Israel in the time of John the Baptist,
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.540]   so for us, God is actually calling us this year
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.700]   into a place of stark discomfort
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.500]   in order that we might discover something
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.500]   that we would never find in our place of security.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.820]   Could it be that the wilderness is actually designed
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.380]   to give us the very thing that we would miss
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.860]   in the normality of life?
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.420]   See, there was a reason why God called Israel
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.660]   out of the comfort of their day to day
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.260]   into the wilderness again,
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.100]   to hear from John at that time in the first century.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.620]   I spoke about it a little bit in the film
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.540]   that you just watched,
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.840]   the reality that actually in the Old Testament,
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.100]   the wilderness was a picture of the reality of something
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.620]   that we often don't think about it in our lives.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.060]   We think of the wilderness or the desert
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.620]   as this isolation experience,
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.620]   as an experience where we're actually separated
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.140]   or far away from God,
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.900]   but actually Israel's history tells them
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.300]   that the wilderness was a place
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.900]   where they would go to meet with God.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.220]   That the wilderness became a turning and a changing point,
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.220]   both in their understanding of the presence of God,
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.700]   as well as for the understanding of themselves.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.500]   I mean, you just need to open up the pages
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.300]   of the Old Testament and begin to see the centrality
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.700]   that the wilderness, the desert plays
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.580]   in the formation and the growth and the change of Israel.
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.380]   There's Abram who's comfortable in the father's household
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.700]   in a place called Ur,
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.860]   and God shows up and pulls him out of that
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.660]   and moves him into the desert of the Negev.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.940]   And it's in that desert place that he looks up
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.380]   and he sees those stars and God gives him a vision.
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.500]   God says, I'm gonna make through you a nation
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.100]   that'll be more numerous than the stars
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.260]   that you can see in this sky right now.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.140]   And God comes and transforms the person of Abram
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.980]   and makes him into Abraham,
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.700]   who comes and makes him a father of the multitudes.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.460]   It's in the desert place where actually Abraham
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.220]   gets a vision of what it is that God wants to do,
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.060]   that God's gonna create a covenant with this group of people
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.460]   to make them a blessing to all nations.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.700]   It's actually in the wilderness that Abraham begins
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.860]   to understand the purpose and the promises
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.100]   that he has for his life.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.780]   Or I have a thing about Hagar.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.100]   Hagar, who was the maid servant of Sarah
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.140]   and the concubine of Abraham.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.220]   The one who was under oppression from Sarah at the time
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.260]   and was forced herself to flee into the wilderness.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.500]   And it was in the desert place
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.380]   that an angel of the Lord came to her
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.020]   in her most desperate moment
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.100]   when she thought her son was gonna die,
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.900]   where she had given him up to die.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.420]   The angel of the Lord comes and says,
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:20.140]   I'm a God who sees you and shows her an oasis
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.300]   where she can get refreshment and provision
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.780]   and be able to bring her child back to life.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.300]   Or think about Jacob.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.780]   He wrestled with God in the desert place, in the wilderness.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.060]   And it was there that God changed his name
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.980]   and said that you're gonna be
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.020]   the biological father of Israel.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.100]   And your sons will be the 12 tribes
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.700]   that would start the journey of this nation.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.100]   Think about Moses, who had fled out of the home
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.780]   as an Egyptian prince, who had murdered an Egyptian
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.700]   and was now in the desert as a shepherd,
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.580]   running from all his pain, running from all his hurt.
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.820]   And it's in the desert place that God in his holiness
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.340]   and his power shows up with the burning bush
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.860]   and welcomes him into a new time
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.860]   where he's restored in his identity,
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.500]   where he comes to understand and meet God.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.660]   And it's there at the burning bush
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.780]   that God declares himself as the I Am for the first time.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.460]   Yahweh, defining his reality for the people of Israel.
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.980]   Or think about Israel themselves,
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.740]   taken out of slavery in Egypt,
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.220]   brought into the wilderness to Mount Sinai.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.900]   And it's in that desert place
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.860]   where the pillar of fire comes.
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.500]   The law is opened up to them
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.380]   with the 10 commandments on Sinai,
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.300]   where they get this intimacy with God
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.980]   that they'd never had before.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.900]   And where God would speak to shape them into the nation
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.540]   he desired them to be.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.740]   Think about David.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.060]   David wrote the most profound Psalms that we have.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.900]   Almost all the Psalms that he wrote,
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.540]   he wrote in exile in the desert place.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.900]   Think about Israel themselves
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.500]   when they were taken into Babylonian exile
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.780]   through the desert.
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.340]   And in a place of stark barrenness,
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.660]   had to wrestle with the reality
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.500]   that their sin had brought them there.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.820]   And that they were beginning to turn
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.660]   to a new understanding of God
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.300]   in the place of their wilderness.
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.740]   What you see throughout the scriptures
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.900]   is God moving his people in and out of the desert place.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.420]   And it's there that he manifests the power
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.860]   of who he is to them.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.380]   You see, there's something critical
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.580]   we need to know about the wilderness.
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.060]   See, the wilderness has always been the place for God
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.660]   of our accelerated growth and transformation.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.900]   God's always used the wilderness
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.380]   to accelerate growth and transformation in his people.
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.060]   And you see throughout the story of the Old Testament,
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.820]   I think this transformation happening
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.180]   in three profound ways in the desert place.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.060]   First of all, the desert was always
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.740]   about a place of intimacy.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.580]   It was always where God would draw near
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.420]   to his people in their most desperate time.
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.700]   It's always where you see this intimacy
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.060]   where almost like the distractions of our lives
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.660]   are stripped away from us.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.100]   The desert place in its barrenness
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.140]   means that there's nowhere else for us to go
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.740]   other than into this profound picture of who God is.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.740]   See, the desert place is the invitation to intimacy.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.300]   We often think that actually the desert is a lonely place,
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.100]   but actually the desert is a place
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.140]   of intimacy and connection.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.980]   The desert is a place of revelation
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.740]   where we can no longer hide God
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.300]   behind the distractions of our lives.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:27.300]   In fact, what the desert does is it puts God in plain sight.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.460]   He's right there, right there before us.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.820]   And we get to see something of his majesty and his beauty
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.740]   that would be distracted and covered up
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.060]   by the normal busyness of life.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.460]   It's about intimacy.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.280]   But the desert was also about this second process,
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.140]   that of teaching.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.140]   You see, God always brought his people in the desert,
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.380]   not just to draw near by his presence,
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.340]   but to give them a message.
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.420]   He had something on his heart.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.420]   He wanted to communicate to them.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:00.660]   So Hagar experiences profoundness of God's presence
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.580]   by the water of that oasis.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.460]   And she understands that God is one who sees her,
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.580]   that God is one who provides for her.
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.900]   And it begins to shape a teaching for her
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.420]   around the power of God's provision.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.980]   Moses with the mountain and with Sinai,
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:15.900]   God shows up and says,
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.500]   "This is what I want you to do to worship me.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.100]   You're gonna worship me with all your heart, mind,
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.700]   soul, and strength, and you're gonna worship
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.780]   and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.360]   And as you do these two things,
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.500]   there is a commandment and a structure of the law
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.180]   to enable you to connect with me
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.340]   and to connect to one another."
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.420]   There's a teaching you need to know
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.180]   about what it is to walk in a place of holiness
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.660]   before each other.
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.980]   When Israel was in that wilderness place of exile,
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.780]   God spoke to them about their sin
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.840]   and challenged them that they needed to change,
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.540]   the desert has always been a place,
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.340]   not just of the intimacy of his presence,
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.560]   but also of the power of his word to speak,
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.100]   to change, to challenge, and to make new.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.860]   And the third thing is that the desert
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.100]   is a place of great healing.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.580]   Because once you are intimate with the Lord,
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.020]   once he's met you in your own barrenness,
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.860]   once he's spoken his word and told you what it is
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.620]   that's on his heart for both you and for his purposes,
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.560]   then this place of healing comes,
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.180]   where Hagar is able to stand up and go and collect her son
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.960]   and know that she is not the person
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.340]   that Sarah had told her she was.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.220]   Where Moses would be able to be there
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.260]   before the holiness of the burning bush
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.260]   and be able to stand and say,
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.060]   "Even despite the fact that I'm not particularly articulate,
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.380]   I will go back to Pharaoh,
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.060]   the one I've actually run away from,
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.340]   and I'm gonna ask him to let my people go."
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.300]   Where Israel in Mount Sinai would begin to understand
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.140]   that they are not to worship a plethora of gods
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.500]   like the Egyptians had,
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.520]   but now they are to worship that one God.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.620]   And as they worship the one sole God,
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.120]   they are formed in their identity as a nation,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.600]   no longer slaves,
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.620]   but released to the promised land for freedom.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.900]   You see, the desert is a place of intimacy,
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.060]   of teaching and of healing.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.620]   And it is a place that moves us on that journey.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.620]   And all of that would have been in the minds
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.100]   and the hearts of Israel,
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.640]   when they hear that some 400 years after God being silent,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.340]   a prophet was speaking again in the wilderness.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.100]   The wilderness would have communicated
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.500]   to the Jewish people of the first century,
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.180]   the things that they had seen in the Old Testament.
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.500]   When they heard a prophet was now calling them
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.380]   into the wilderness,
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.820]   they would have stepped into the wilderness
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.460]   with this thought in their minds.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.700]   They would have heard the idea
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.260]   that God is calling them into intimacy again.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.380]   They would have heard the idea
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.980]   that God has got something to say to them,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.700]   a message to bring to them.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.580]   What they would have heard
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.300]   is that now would be the time for them to be renewed,
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.980]   for them to be healed again.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.800]   This would have been on their hearts and their minds.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.640]   They wouldn't have thought,
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.360]   oh, I'm being called into the wilderness to be told off,
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.120]   to be separated from God, to be in a barren place.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.320]   No, they would have felt this call of God to intimacy,
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.280]   to teaching, to healing, to restoration, to new.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.720]   When they would heard
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.200]   that there is an invitation to the wilderness,
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.640]   what would have been communicated to them
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.080]   above everything else was this,
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.400]   that God was about to act again to redeem His people.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.740]   That's what they would have heard.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.060]   That's not what we hear though, is it?
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.020]   I mean, how do we feel when we're in a wilderness place?
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.820]   How do we come to think of the desert place for us?
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.700]   I think so often when we think of the wilderness,
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.680]   we think of it as a place of judgment and punishment.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.500]   We think the wilderness is a place that we go to
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.980]   when we've done wrong with God.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.740]   The wilderness is a place that we go to
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.900]   to be told off by God,
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.340]   almost like it's the naughty corner of the Christian life.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.180]   And because we come to think of the wilderness
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.260]   as an absence of God, rather than an intimacy with Him,
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.020]   which is how the Jewish people saw it,
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.340]   as we see it as this absence of God,
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.100]   we do everything we can to avoid the wilderness.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.940]   Or if we think we're about to head into the wilderness,
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.060]   we wonder what's wrong with ourselves.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.540]   When actually, could it be that the wilderness
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.180]   is a place of our greatest freedom?
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.740]   Could it be that what we see
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.420]   in the ministry of John the Baptist
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.780]   and what we see in the season of Advent
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.660]   is actually an invitation for us
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.060]   to actually redefine our wilderness?
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.740]   Maybe here, as we journey to the end of 2020
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.100]   and we head to the beginning of 2021,
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.620]   maybe God wants you to redefine your wilderness.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.820]   That time that you thought was a sort of an abstraction
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.720]   from the presence of God
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.500]   might actually be the greatest welcome into intimacy
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.100]   and His word and your healing
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.960]   than you ever have experienced before.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.900]   That's what John the Baptist thought.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.140]   That's why he stood in that place of the wilderness
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.740]   and called Israel out to him again.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.700]   And I wanna show you actually through the scripture
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.980]   that we're looking at today,
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.260]   the way in which John the Baptist creates this idea of hope,
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.740]   even in a place as barren as the Judean landscape.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.900]   Let me read verses seven to 10 to you once again.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.900]   But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.140]   coming to where he was baptizing,
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.300]   he said to them, "You brood of vipers,
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.940]   who warned you to flee from the coming wrath,
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.340]   produce fruit now in keeping with repentance.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.060]   And do not think that you can say to yourselves,
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.980]   oh, we have Abraham as our father.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.940]   I tell you that out of these stones,
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.580]   God can raise up children for Abraham."
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.380]   See, the ax is already at the root of the trees
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.940]   and every tree that does not produce good fruit
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.460]   will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.140]   Now there's some pretty strong words that John has here
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.700]   for the Sadducees and the Pharisees.
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.060]   I mean, he's speaking some things pretty directly
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.440]   to them, brood of vipers, ax at the trees,
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.740]   cutting things down.
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.380]   Yeah, it sounds pretty strong, but in the midst of that,
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.380]   I want you to see what pops here.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.500]   Two things that John repeats.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.740]   He mentions the idea of fruit twice.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.620]   He mentions the second time that it's actually good fruit.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.860]   In other words, what he's challenging Israel with
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.260]   is yeah, they need to change.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.020]   Yeah, there is this repentance that,
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.300]   as I talked about last week,
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.260]   is that 180 shifting and reorienting into a new direction.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.860]   But John wants them to focus on the reality that is fruit.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.140]   Hey, live in the fruit, expect the fruit.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.700]   Don't hold anything back
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.820]   that might try to take away the fruit.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.500]   See, the reality is the desert
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.260]   is actually the place of fruitfulness.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.500]   The desert isn't this place
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.180]   where everything's supposed to go wrong.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.420]   The desert isn't a place where you're supposed to go to
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.500]   so you have to wait 40 years for God to speak.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.100]   No, now the desert becomes a place of great fruitfulness.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.700]   I like to think of it like this,
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.740]   the desert is like the great potter's wheel of God.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.980]   And through it, he actually creates us
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.460]   into new works of art, beautiful new works of art,
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.540]   ways in which we can become more fully alive,
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.340]   more fully true in him.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.420]   And yes, the desert is a harsh place.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.740]   Yes, there are words that God wants to bring us
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.940]   in that place where we bring our sin to him,
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.540]   where we repent of the things that we need to repent of,
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.540]   but there's a movement through the desert.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.260]   You see, one of the things that's important to know
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.940]   is that Israel never made their home forever in the desert.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.460]   The desert was a journey for them.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:24.100]   It was a movement of that intimacy teaching and that healing
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.540]   so that they would be restored to then be released
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.060]   back into what it is that God has for them.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.620]   And you actually see that in the verses here.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.660]   You see John actually bringing his people
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.380]   in this journey, in this movement.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.180]   First of all, calling them out of the civilization
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.060]   of their sin, welcoming them into the desert place
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.620]   of repentance, the wilderness of that intimacy
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.580]   and teaching and healing that God wanted
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.500]   to bring his people so that they could then go
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.020]   into the waters, the river of life.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.420]   And Justin's gonna come next week and talk to us
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.460]   about the beauty of the refreshing waters
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.220]   of the washing of our sins through this picture
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.700]   of baptism, but I want you to see this week
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.720]   the journey that takes place.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.240]   We have to get out of the civilization of our sin.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.500]   We have to walk into the desert wilderness place
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.660]   so we can be intimate, we can be taught,
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.340]   we can be healed so that we are then released
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.140]   into the cleansing and refreshing
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.000]   and the fullness of life that he has for us.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.900]   I wonder whether Christ might wanna come right now
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.580]   and begin to redefine for you your wilderness.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.480]   Some of you are in a wilderness time right now
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.180]   and you've been beating yourself up,
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.660]   you've been finding it hard, but maybe it's
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.940]   because you've been thinking about this time
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.300]   in the wrong way.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:44.540]   Maybe it might be a shift for you in your spirit today
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.180]   to begin to actually celebrate the very thing
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.940]   that God's got you in.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.980]   Doesn't mean it's gonna suddenly be easy,
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.740]   but a shift in your heart towards what the desert
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.120]   is a gift to you, the fruitfulness that God wants
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.960]   to bring to you out of the season that you're in
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.700]   in your life right now.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.100]   And that fruitfulness comes, and I love this in verse 10.
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.700]   Let me read this to us.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.940]   The axe is already at the root of the trees
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.820]   and every tree that does not produce good fruit
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.640]   will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.140]   This is John standing before Israel
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.460]   and telling them what's about to happen next.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.860]   He's like, God will do anything, absolutely anything
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.560]   to be able to fight back the enemy,
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.340]   where the enemy would try to keep people from him.
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.360]   You see, what he's saying here is he's saying anything
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.380]   that will come against the good fruit,
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.840]   anything that stands in the way of what I wanna do
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.840]   through my intimacy and my instruction with my word
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.280]   and my healing of the people,
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.280]   anything that's gonna stand in the way.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.120]   Well, guess what?
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.440]   The axe is at the root of that tree,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.000]   and I will cut down anything that will stand
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.340]   in the good fruit that this wilderness experience
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.340]   wants to bring.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.920]   And as I was preparing this message,
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.400]   I felt that in my spirit
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.040]   for some of you watching here today.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.080]   I felt like there's some things going on in your lives
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.640]   and there's some things that are happening,
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.040]   and you know that there is obstructions between you and God.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.820]   And I want you to know that no weapon
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.340]   that has been formed against you will ever prosper.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.460]   I want you to know that nothing that the enemy can do
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.480]   to hold you back from that healing and for that restoration,
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.720]   from the teaching of his word, for what he wants to do,
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.240]   nothing is gonna hold you back permanently
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.440]   from the good fruit that God desires to bring.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.600]   See, the axe is at the root of the tree and the strategies
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.360]   and the things that the enemy has,
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.480]   and anything that will hold that good fruit back,
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.040]   God wants to change.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:44.840]   See, this is the work, the act, the work of the wilderness.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.160]   It is actually to bring us into that place
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.600]   where God will do everything,
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.440]   that anything that would ever stop us receiving
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.720]   that intimacy and that teaching and that healing
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.360]   will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.040]   I mean, isn't that an encouragement?
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.640]   I mean, for some of you who think
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.380]   that this wilderness journey right now
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.360]   is the worst thing that could ever happen to you,
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.720]   actually God sees it as the place
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.760]   of your greatest transformation.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.520]   That in him and through him,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.760]   he might begin to shift and change you.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.800]   I think there are many things that we actually end up
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.920]   carrying around with us that end up weighing us down
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.320]   that God doesn't want us to have.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.040]   And you saw this in the video,
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.080]   and I wanted to remind us of this again today.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.200]   And I think there are some things
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.440]   that the enemy places upon us,
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.080]   that the enemy wants us to carry
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.520]   so that we feel weighed down in the process of our lives.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.880]   Things like the deep hurts that we have in our lives,
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.420]   the hurts that come to us,
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.800]   maybe from the words of people around us
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.160]   who have tried to define us in a certain way
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.600]   that's different to how God would define us,
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.040]   just like in Hagar's experience.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.400]   Or maybe it might be the abandonment we feel at times,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.760]   the abandonment we feel when we haven't heard words of love
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.640]   and affirmation from those that are closest to us in life.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.600]   Or maybe in this season, it's the depression
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.480]   and the anxiety, those dual things
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.680]   that seem to come against us
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.200]   in the moments of our wilderness experiences,
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.240]   in the moments of the desert
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.120]   where we struggle with our depression and anxiety,
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.720]   and that stresses us
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.920]   and brings those additional stresses of life upon us.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.200]   Perhaps it's actually in the place of wound,
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.160]   those wounds that come upon us
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.040]   because of our broken relationships in our lives,
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.480]   maybe with our loved ones,
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.280]   like we were talking about earlier,
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.240]   or those problems in our families
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.840]   that just seem to weigh us down.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.320]   Or perhaps finally, it might be the idea of our habitual sin,
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.200]   that sin that we can't seem to change
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.560]   or the sin that we can't seem to shake from us
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.580]   that just seems to be placed upon us
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.260]   and places this weight and this burden on us.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.120]   And here's the reality.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.840]   We walk into our wilderness carrying all of this stuff,
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.560]   all of the things that the enemy would place upon us
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.320]   to hold us back and to weigh us down
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.240]   and to tell us that this is what defines us
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.320]   rather than the liberation and the presence
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.480]   and the intimacy and the teaching
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.540]   and the healing of the word of God.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.800]   But the problem we find is it's hard for us
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.900]   to pick up anything else when we're so burdened
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.680]   by the stuff that the enemy has given us.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.960]   You know, Jesus says in Mark chapter eight,
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.200]   he says it quite profoundly.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.120]   He says, "If you wanna follow me,
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.120]   if you wanna come after me,
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.000]   here's what you are to pick up.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.120]   You're not to pick up those wounds and the hurts.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.240]   You're not to pick up the things
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.720]   that you think bad about yourself.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.160]   You're not gonna pick up that abandonment.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.000]   Here's the thing to pick up.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.200]   Pick up your cross.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.760]   Pick up the very symbol of what the ultimate experience
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.680]   of the wilderness is.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.440]   For us, the cross is often celebrated by the cup
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.080]   and by the bread, isn't it?
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.900]   These two symbols of that communion experience given to us
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.920]   because of the cross of Christ.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.800]   And if the cross is anything,
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.520]   it's God's ultimate wilderness journey.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.320]   It's the time where Jesus goes to the cross
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.080]   and he goes into that place of separation from his father.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.820]   He goes into that place of abject loneliness,
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.640]   of being naked and unashamed, stripped down,
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.400]   whipped and beaten.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.840]   The cross, this great symbol of death
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.080]   is transformed in the wilderness
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.720]   to become this place of great life
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.760]   through the teaching and through that healing
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.600]   and through that intimacy that's found in the cross
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.520]   in the resurrection.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.440]   We now find ourselves in a place
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.940]   where we get to pick up our cross
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.840]   rather than the things that we've found
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.640]   gathered around us in the journey in life.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.020]   But how do we pick up what Christ has afforded for us
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.940]   in his death and resurrection?
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.920]   Well, it can only come when we realize
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.440]   that the wilderness of the cross provides for us
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.400]   the newness of our life.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.440]   And because of the forgiveness of sin,
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.740]   we are able to lay down the things
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.680]   that the enemy had placed on us
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:23.040]   and to pick up the new symbols of our life.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.460]   The bread of the body of Christ that was broken
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.200]   so that we would know the wholeness and the renewal of him.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.520]   The blood that was shed
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.220]   so that we would experience forgiveness of sin.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.520]   The wilderness of the cross becomes for us
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.360]   a journey into our wilderness,
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.540]   a journey into the place
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.320]   where we are stripped naked ourselves,
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.840]   where we realize that there is nothing
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.200]   that we have to offer,
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.520]   where we realize that we are not worthy,
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.040]   where we realize that all of those sticks
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.080]   that we're carrying do hold us back.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:57.080]   And yet in the invitation of the cross of Jesus,
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   we come to a new place where we get to lay our crowns down
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.120]   and we get to receive from him
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.860]   the things that he paid a great price for,
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.020]   the things that truly set us free.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:16.280]   The invitation to communion is the invitation to us
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.480]   moving into that place of the river of life.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.140]   And as you are thinking
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.240]   about your wilderness experience today,
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.200]   let me challenge you with this.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.960]   Let me challenge you to redefine your wilderness.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.280]   Let me challenge you to have this expectation
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.440]   that in the dryness right now,
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.420]   you can expect the intimacy of God
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.000]   like you've never experienced before.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.400]   Let me encourage you
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.060]   that it's actually in the place of wilderness
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.000]   where God wants to speak to you,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.720]   where his voice wants to come and begin to shape you
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.460]   and teach you and show you his ways.
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.140]   May you have a change in your perspective
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.200]   this season of Advent where you begin to say,
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.480]   no, I'm gonna ask for my healing.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.760]   I'm gonna ask my restoration as I receive that intimacy,
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.240]   as I listen to his voice,
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   I can expect the transformation of myself.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.680]   May you know that in your redefined wilderness,
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:17.040]   you will find what Israel found in that moment,
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.440]   a reorientation of life.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:25.440]   Just like I said in the film, us humanity fully alive.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:32.080]   So may I welcome you to the communion table today.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.040]   And if you've prepared communion,
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.480]   this is the time just to gather that around you.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.240]   If you haven't, you have about 30 seconds
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.640]   to rush off to your kitchen or wherever it is
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.240]   to grab something that you can use for communion.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.540]   It could be some grape juice, it could be some water,
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.080]   it could be maybe some fruit or a piece of bread
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.560]   if you have it at home, whatever works for you,
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.440]   maybe just gather up now that communion thing
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.480]   and we're gonna share in this together.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.560]   You know, they gathered in that upper room right there
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.200]   at the end of that final week of Jesus's life.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.760]   And Jesus having prepared himself
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.960]   for the coming wilderness of the cross,
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.680]   takes the bread in that moment
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.880]   that would have been shared in the normal Passover feast.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.920]   And he takes that Passover celebration
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.240]   and brings it onto himself.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.080]   And in taking the bread, he rips it open,
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.320]   symbolizing of course,
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.860]   the coming tearing apart of his body on that cross.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.860]   And as he rips it open, he takes it, he breaks it,
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.560]   he blesses it, and then he shares it
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.420]   with those that are around him.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.640]   And in sharing it, he says,
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:45.440]   "This is my body broken for you."
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.760]   Paul later would pick up on that to his church in Corinth.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.380]   And he says, "This is what we get to do
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.520]   as we celebrate the release into the fullness
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.120]   of what God has for us in our lives.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.120]   We take the bread that has been prepared."
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.560]   And so let me invite you now to hold that bread
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.360]   in your hands and let me pray for us for the bread.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.140]   Father, we thank you for this symbol of your life
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.300]   that has been broken for us.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:13.980]   We thank you that this life has been prepared for us,
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.920]   that whatever wilderness experience
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.380]   we might be in right now,
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.940]   we know that there is fruitfulness in this place,
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.820]   that we know that there is this redefining
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.080]   of our expectations as we now come to you,
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.000]   that your body broken on the wilderness of the cross
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.340]   invites us now to intimacy in you.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.000]   And as we take the bread, we do so knowing
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.460]   that your life forms and shapes for us
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.480]   the fullness of life that we are now welcomed into.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.360]   And so we take this bread in Jesus' name.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.240]   Let us eat this together now.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:54.640]   And as we take the bread, we now come to the cup.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.180]   And the cup is this great symbol, of course,
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.920]   of the shed blood of Jesus for us.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.960]   And it's a blood that's shed for the forgiveness of our sin.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.680]   And we know that as Israel was called into the wilderness
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.000]   by John the Baptist, it was with this message of repentance.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.800]   And we walk into that wilderness of the cross,
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.660]   knowing that it is also our place of repentance,
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.920]   our place to bring our biggest worries and our stresses,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.120]   the war that I was speaking about earlier,
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.400]   those logs that we so easily carry around with us.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.440]   It's time for us to bring them before God
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.440]   and to feel Him release us from them.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.040]   So I want you just to take a moment,
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.000]   maybe just a few seconds right now,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.960]   as you hold the cup in your hand,
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.740]   just to bring yourself before Him in repentance.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.000]   Allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.200]   And is it wounds for you?
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.760]   They're hurt for you?
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.600]   Is it things that you're carrying around
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.400]   that is abandonment?
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.360]   Maybe you haven't heard the words from your loved ones
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.200]   that you are hoping to hear.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.160]   Maybe there's disappointment in yourself.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.440]   Maybe there's habitual sin that's at work.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.920]   Whatever it might be, take a moment now
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.680]   to lay down those sticks before Him.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.800]   So to visualize yourself unloading that heavy weight
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.240]   before the cross today.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.880]   I'm just gonna give you a few seconds
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.040]   to do that in the quietness of your moment.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:18.080]   Father, we thank you for this time
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.880]   where the desert reminds us of the barrenness
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.760]   of what sin does to us.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.000]   And yet the hope that there is in the meeting of you
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.680]   in that place, where you redefined identity for Israel
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.840]   and identity for all of the people that you encountered
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.840]   in the desert place.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.320]   So as we come to the crossing communion,
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.960]   you redefine our identity from sinners
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.920]   to those that have been forgiven,
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.520]   from those that have been at war
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.840]   to those that are now at peace.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.560]   And we celebrate this through the shedding of your blood.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.760]   And we take communion now in that spirit in Jesus name,
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.480]   we share together in the cup.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:02.360]   We're grateful that we get to do that in celebration
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.720]   and in release.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   And now as we do so,
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.600]   we're gonna enter into a moment of worship
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.520]   as we come before God and celebrate the reality.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.480]   And wherever it is that you are here at the end of 2020,
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.920]   no matter what's been going on in your life,
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.880]   no matter how hard it's felt in that wilderness place,
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.040]   know that Christ is bringing his intimacy,
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.440]   his word to you and his healing to set you free.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.320]   Why don't we join together in this moment of worship?
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.900]   (gentle music)
