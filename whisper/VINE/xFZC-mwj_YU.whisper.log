[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   All right, I hope everybody is settling.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.460]   Now before we continue our service, we have a few announcements.
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.160]   And first of all, as you saw earlier, we have witnessed together as a family a baby dedication.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.160]   So if you were wondering, oh, what is baby dedication, and whether your child, if you
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.240]   would like your child to have a baby dedication as well, we welcome you to talk to our pastoral
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.080]   team, Ivan and team as well, to talk more about it, to understand more and see how we
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.640]   can do it as a family together.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.280]   Okay, so you're more than welcome to do so.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.600]   Now, second announcement is that we're going to have bring your own lunch today.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   Yes, make some noise for that.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.600]   Oh, no, thank you.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.880]   Thanks Andrew.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.000]   Now bring your own lunch.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.320]   It's our practice, because we really treasure us getting to know each other.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.600]   So this is a once a month event where we welcome all of you after English service, you go grab
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.360]   your food, your favorite food around here, and then you bring your food back here, and
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.400]   we get to have a meal together.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.800]   Now we had an invitation earlier when we talked about bring your own lunch.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.960]   Today, I want to invite for those who are coming, maybe you're still deciding, I want
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.520]   to invite you to perhaps take a courage to chat with one or two people that you don't
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.920]   know, sit with them, have a meal with them.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.520]   You know, as we were talking about bless, how we can, you know, bless our neighbors,
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.920]   the first thing is, one of the things is eat with them, listen to them, ask them questions,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.640]   have been known and also known other people as well.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.280]   So I'm going to send the invitation.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.720]   I hope you receive it and you do it as well.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.720]   All right.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.400]   So we will also need helpers to help set up the tables and all that.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.520]   So if you would like to stay in or even you would like to just help out, we need that.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.520]   Okay.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.080]   So after service, you can help us set up the venue.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.520]   It would be really good.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.520]   Okay.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.240]   And the next and the last announcement of today is we've been having starting new ministries
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.800]   and we are going to start our youth ministry.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.000]   Let's make some big voice for that.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.520]   We've been praying for this.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.960]   We've been preparing for this for time and now this is happening.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.680]   Now youth, if there's youth among us, I see many very youthful faces.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.600]   We invite you to, you know, scan the QR code and join our first youth event.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   Now what we're going to do in this event, it's basically just for us to get to know
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.280]   you, you get to know us and know each other.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.680]   And we hope to in the future, continually, regularly meet together because we really,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.280]   that's one of our vision to really serve the youth here as well.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.280]   All right.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.720]   So if you're already signed up, I know a lot of you already signed up.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.760]   Really amazing.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.560]   The next step you can do is to invite your friends, invite your school friends or invite
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.360]   your kids or even your neighbor's kids.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.360]   All right.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.360]   So that's what you can do.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.000]   Now, if you're not youth, you're like, nah, I don't have a kid or anything.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.520]   What you can do is pray for us.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.240]   Pray for us as a family.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.760]   Pray for this ministry.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.040]   Pray for those youth who's going to come and all the teachers.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.360]   You know, it's a new team and we're going to serve this, start this new ministry.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.960]   There's a lot of unknown, but what is known is God is in control and this group belongs
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   to God.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   Amen.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   Lovely.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.760]   Now we're going to get into time of offering.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.960]   Yes.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.520]   Offering it's a way of how we continue our worship to God, to give him back of what he
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.920]   blessed us with.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.000]   So we just encourage, you know, you've been here for a long time and you really want to
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.560]   take part of this.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.240]   There's many, many ways you can do that.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.120]   There's digital ways you can scan the QR code and we also have the bucket and there's some
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.880]   envelopes for you as well.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.640]   And we also encourage if you would like to doing this monthly automatic payment that
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.120]   will help us as a church to be able to know the budget and so on.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.120]   Yes.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.600]   Can we all pray together for the offering?
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.840]   Yes.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.200]   Father, we thank you for your provision.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.160]   We thank you for your provision all along from a vision of a church plan vision to here.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.960]   We are gathering here in the divine yin long in Hoshinle building and Lord, thank you for
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.700]   how you've been providing us financially, spiritually and people and all the helpers
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.200]   and everything that you provided us Lord.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.880]   Lord, I pray that you bless the money and bless all the ministries that it's going on
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.880]   Lord.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.040]   I pray that with you give us wisdom to run different ministry, to reach out to people
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.360]   that you've called us to reach out to Lord.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.480]   We thank you and we trust you.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.960]   We love you and in Jesus name together we say, Amen.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.440]   All right.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.440]   Thank you.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.440]   All right.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.800]   And today I'm going to invite John back on stage.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   Let's give him a big round.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.680]   I'm always so excited to see him because I feel like his energy is just like mine.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.680]   I'm like really surprised, right?
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   But I feel like his energy is even more.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.040]   I love that.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.760]   Thank you for being here and lead us beautiful dedication.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   Of course.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.160]   Can we all reach our hands and pray for him?
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.040]   Thank you Jesus and thank you Father for John, for what a faithful, humble servant and a
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.000]   leader and a friend and a father and yeah, and pastor to us Lord.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.040]   And thank you for all that he's doing and all that you're doing in his life Lord.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.360]   And thank you for all the talents and gifts you've given him.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.600]   And Lord, I pray that you would continue to speak to him and that he would just share your
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.240]   words to us Lord and with such power and such boldness Lord.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.520]   And Lord, I pray that you open our hearts to receiving words.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.520]   Lord, we thank you and we just lift up this time to you.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.000]   May you take lead and spirit.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.160]   May you just fill his heart.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.640]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   Amen.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.560]   Let's hear it for Francesca please.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.640]   You're a ball of energy.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.640]   I love it.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.720]   I'm so thrilled to be here on this special day.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.080]   Ellie's dedication and first birthday.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.600]   Amazing.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.520]   But above all, I'm here to ask you a question.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:34.040]   A very important question.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.440]   Who are you?
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.360]   I mean, who are you?
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:53.720]   You see, so often our identity is found in our job or our achievements or our role.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:03.880]   And we get examples like we are Dorothy, head of regional banks and brokers at Bloomberg.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.360]   Very impressive.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.120]   Or Francesca.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.520]   Actually she says, I'm an actor.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.840]   You might have seen me on stage or even TV.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.320]   Wow.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.160]   Or my achievements.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.480]   I'm a Stanford graduate or an MBA.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.320]   I'm the top salesman in my company.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.600]   I captained the school basketball team.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.720]   Or our role.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:46.320]   I'm a husband, a mother, a CG leader, a K4C helper and so on.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.560]   But they are what you do.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.660]   They are not who you are.
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:02.000]   You may have noticed Francesca very kindly introduced me as John today.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.600]   I'm fed up with this guy called Pastor John because I go, Sandra, we go anywhere in Hong
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.160]   Kong, someone says, "Ah, Pastor John!"
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:19.200]   My name is not Pastor John.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:26.120]   My identity is not what I do in church.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:39.040]   When I ask you who you were, what I was really asking about was your identity.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:46.840]   But I repeat with fear of repetition the question, who are you?
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:55.280]   Or more specifically, on what do you base your identity?
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.880]   In our passage today we read, I'll put it on the screen, "For in Christ Jesus you are
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.640]   all sons of God through faith.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:15.520]   And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring as according to the promise."
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:21.360]   Now as an aside here, for sons, you could take to include sons and daughters in our
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.640]   current context.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:31.080]   But Paul deliberately used sons here as in ancient times it was only sons who were heirs,
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.160]   only sons could inherit.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:42.520]   But the whole point of the letter to the Galatians is that Paul is telling them, "You are Abraham's
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:49.240]   offspring as according to promise."
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:58.920]   Even to a church that was confused about their identity in Christ, this was good news indeed.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:05.600]   In that statement, "You are Abraham's offspring as according to the promise," Paul was making
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:12.800]   reference to the covenant that God had established with Abraham.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.680]   And the sign of that covenant was circumcision.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:24.440]   Look at this from Genesis 17, "Then God said to Abraham, 'As for you, you must keep my
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.000]   covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.640]   This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:40.520]   The covenant you are to keep, every male should be circumcised."
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.720]   All the men in the congregation say, "Ouch."
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:51.920]   "You are to undergo circumcision and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.680]   you."
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:00.280]   Paul in his teachings continually makes the point that under the new covenant where the
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:12.680]   law of Moses has been replaced by the grace of Jesus, physical circumcision has been replaced
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:23.240]   by a spiritual circumcision which is described in Romans 2 as a circumcision of the heart.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:29.600]   Paul is reminding the Galatian church that the terms of the Abrahamic covenant have been
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:36.480]   fully fulfilled by Jesus and his death on the cross.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:43.240]   And that whilst the old covenant, the law had been symbolized by the outward sign of
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:53.600]   circumcision, under the new covenant, a covenant of grace, it had become internalized.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.160]   It had become a heart matter.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:05.120]   But the Jewish Galatian church was still ignoring this.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:14.720]   They were saying that circumcision was still a pre-requirement to be accepted by God.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:22.320]   Might my words, this was a church in prison.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   Not a physical one like Stanley or Sheppick prison.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.560]   But look at how Paul starts this passage.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:41.800]   Verse 23, "Before the coming of the faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:50.280]   up, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:59.000]   So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.880]   Now this faith has come.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.040]   We are no longer under a guardian."
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.440]   Let me give you an analogy.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:17.600]   Suppose you are in Stanley or Sheppick prison and someone's come to bail you out and the
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   prison door is open.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.240]   You are free to leave.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.660]   But you decide to stay put.
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.880]   You rather like the prison.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.000]   The guards are friendly, yeah right.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.880]   And your cellmates are a really great bunch.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.960]   It sounds nonsensical.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.880]   But this is exactly what the Galatian church was doing.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:14:00.040]   And to be honest with you, not too dissimilar to many churches around Hong Kong and the
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.080]   world today.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:12.080]   They had elevated the law above grace and were trying to earn God's favor by keeping
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.960]   all the rules and by doing good deeds.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.600]   Paul had called them fools.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.680]   He might say the same today.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:32.160]   In fact, let's look back to last week and the beginning of the chapter.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:39.640]   Verse 1, "You foolish Galatians!
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.200]   Who has bewitched you?
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.800]   Before your very eyes Jesus was clearly portrayed as crucified.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.440]   I would just like to learn one thing from you.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:59.920]   Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing what you heard?
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.160]   Are you so foolish?
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:09.720]   After beginning by the means of the Spirit, you are now trying to finish by means of the
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.720]   flesh."
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:18.080]   And our passage today tells us very clearly four things.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.480]   Number one, the law enslaves.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.040]   Number two, the Spirit sets us free.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:35.120]   Number three, we are all equal sharers in inheritance.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:43.440]   And lastly, our relationship is a son, not a slave.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.040]   Let's look at the context here.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:54.200]   Paul is distressed that the Galatian church, the Gentile believers are being persuaded
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:02.280]   to adopt circumcision and the observance of Jewish law as necessary to inclusion as God's
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.640]   covenant people.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:10.240]   He reminds the Galatians they receive the Spirit by believing the proclamation about
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:18.680]   Christ and not by doing works of the law.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.760]   We would do well to remember this.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:32.600]   Our faith is all about receiving, not achieving.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.880]   Can I say that again?
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.760]   Church of Hong Kong, can I say this again?
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:48.360]   Our faith is all about receiving and not achieving.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:55.640]   Now we can sit here today, I'm sure we are, foolish, foolish Galatians.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:01.360]   But I ask us this, are we in the same boat?
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.920]   Have we turned the freedom in the Spirit purchased by the precious blood of Jesus into a set
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.640]   of rules?
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:19.200]   Have we turned the freedom in the Spirit purchased by the precious blood of Jesus into a set
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.640]   of rules?
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:29.600]   As a start, in order to remind the church in Galatia about their identity as children
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:38.560]   of God, Paul emphasizes the equality of all believers.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:45.200]   The body of Christ, and we're a good representation today, is made up from believers of all tribes
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:55.840]   and tongues, and yet they are all one in Christ Jesus regardless of their race, gender, or
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.720]   financial status.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.400]   Let's read it.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.600]   For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.560]   There is neither Jew nor Greek.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.320]   There is neither slave or free.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:17.080]   There is no male or female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:23.040]   I've done a picture of my car parked here at the YMCA in Tsim Sha Tsui.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:29.320]   I've been a board member of the YMCA now for 29 years, and I don't get too many perks,
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.080]   but one I get is to be able to park my car in Tsim Sha Tsui.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.080]   That's very valuable.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.200]   But look where I park it.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:43.680]   Every time I park, "Father, may they be one as we are one."
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.560]   The words of Jesus.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.520]   Whether in the ancient world or our modern world, there will always be people who regard
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.960]   themselves as superior to others.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.620]   The Jews, they saw themselves as more important than the Gentiles because they thought they
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:11.720]   alone were God's covenant people for reasons I explained earlier.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:22.280]   Free men looked down on slaves, and men perceived themselves as more superior to women.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:35.160]   Fast forward a few centuries, and you will still find slavery, racial segregation, and
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:41.320]   the continued oppression of women in many cultures.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:47.360]   But instead of elevating one group of people above another, Jesus taught the astonishing
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:20:00.020]   truth that all believers, all believers are equal, and unity can only be found in Him.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:11.420]   This is because all human beings are equally enslaved to sin, and all who trust in Him
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.460]   receive His grace.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.460]   We are all equal.
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.300]   We are sinners.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.140]   But when we trust in Him, we receive His grace.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.740]   He goes a stage further.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:33.500]   Paul says this, "If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.500]   to the promise."
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.500]   Wow.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.300]   First, we were slaves.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.700]   Then we were adopted.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:47.660]   And lastly, we've become heirs.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:55.020]   But Paul further clarifies our identity by using the analogy of a child who had to wait
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:21:00.740]   for his inheritance until a date set by his father.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:06.180]   This was to illustrate the sovereign act of God in calling His children to Himself.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.800]   Let's read it.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:16.940]   What I am saying is, as long as an heir is underage, he's no different from a slave.
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:24.660]   Although he owns the whole estate, the heir is subject to guardians and trustees until
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.980]   the time set by his father.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:38.700]   So Paul is offering an illustration from the Roman custom of an heir of an entire estate
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:45.820]   who lives under a slave guardian as long as he is a child.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:53.580]   He's saying he does not differ at all from a slave, though he is to all extent master
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.580]   of all.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:59.220]   Now, the word "child" here is actually a small child.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:06.260]   This person is too young to take the responsibility of adulthood.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:11.900]   A slave or a guardian would tell this child when to get up or when to go to school.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.500]   The guardian disciplined him in every respect.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:25.860]   Now, the Roman custom did not specify an age when a person became ready for adulthood.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.060]   The custom was this.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:34.940]   When the father deemed the heir ready, he celebrated this time with a festival known
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.260]   as the Liberalia.
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.180]   It was held on March the 17th.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:49.700]   At this time, the heir received his toga virilis, the coat of adulthood.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:58.660]   And the boy would burn his childhood toys at this festival to symbolize his adulthood.
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:07.340]   In a complete reversal of roles, that person now has authority over the slave that governed
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.100]   him as a child.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:17.500]   Now what Paul is saying is this, that a person who operates under the law is no different
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:25.380]   from a child who is heir to a wealthy estate and placed under the guardianship of a slave.
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:33.780]   Verse 3 says this, "So also, when we were under age, we were in slavery under the elemental
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.140]   spiritual forces of the world."
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.900]   He was a legal heir.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.020]   Oh, yes.
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:46.340]   But he did not have the privilege of utilizing his legal rights to the estate.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:52.980]   And the law was the guardian that watched over believers in the old covenant.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.740]   I need to tell you this.
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:07.140]   A Christian who reverts to the law puts himself back under guardianship and slavery to the
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.140]   law.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.580]   Can I say that again?
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:20.940]   A Christian who reverts to the law puts himself back under the guardianship and slavery to
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:21.940]   the law.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.380]   But my friends, the good news is to come.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.660]   Let's read it.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:36.260]   "But when the set time had finally come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:47.140]   the law, to redeem those under the law that we might receive adoption to sonship.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:56.640]   Jesus came at a preordained time, set by the Father before the foundation of the world.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:03.260]   He was sent to redeem those who were in slavery so they would be adopted into the Father's
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.260]   household."
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.180]   Let's read on.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:14.420]   "Because you are his sons, God sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts, the spirit who
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.920]   calls out, 'Abba, Father.'
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.660]   So you are no longer a slave."
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.300]   I think we've sung those today.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.460]   "But you are God's child.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:33.060]   And since you are his child, God has made you also an heir."
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.580]   These verses are very, very important.
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:45.540]   Through adoption, they received an inheritance, the Holy Spirit, who enables believers to
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:53.900]   cry out, "Abba, Father, Daddy, Papa."
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:26:04.340]   Believers receive adoption not because of any act of merit, but purely through a sovereign
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.020]   work of God.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:14.980]   So I ask you again, who are you?
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:25.460]   Do you see yourself foremost as your job title, your achievements, a husband or wife, a single
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.220]   or working woman?
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:36.540]   If you have repented and believed the gospel, then you are first and foremost a child of
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.540]   God.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.940]   Can I say that again?
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.340]   You can say amen if you want to.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:51.420]   If you have repented and believed the gospel, you are first and foremost a child of God.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.420]   Thank you.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.380]   I didn't prompt that, did I?
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:05.740]   It doesn't matter where you've come from or what you look like, for the gospel gives unity
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.520]   through diversity.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:18.260]   The only way to love one another despite our differences is to see one another equally
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:26.540]   deserving of judgment, yet equally saved in Christ.
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:35.860]   Your identity as God's child means that you are free to embrace your role in church, your
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:43.500]   family, and society in such a way that you bring God glory without letting that role
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.100]   define who you are.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:59.660]   The only solution to problems regarding race, class, and gender has always been the gospel.
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:13.300]   And the best biblical illustration is perhaps found in the story of the prodigal son.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:20.700]   When the prodigal son went to his father and asked for his inheritance, what he was doing
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:30.080]   in effect, he was choosing to be an orphan.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:36.980]   In Hebrew culture, he was regarding his father as dead.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:45.620]   He was saying, when he said, "I want my inheritance," he was saying, "Father, I regard you as dead."
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:50.860]   But the truth is, he had left his home.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:55.260]   Now we read the story, for a while he enjoyed his life.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:02.060]   It was about wine, women, and song with his so-called friends.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:08.340]   But the reality was the orphan lifestyle wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.720]   It never is.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:17.260]   We often think that the grass is greener away from the father.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:21.140]   His friends, in truth, were just other orphans.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:28.060]   They used him, abused him, and then when he was of no more use to them, they abandoned
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.660]   him.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:36.660]   He was left feeding the pigs.
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:44.460]   Now can you imagine, and can you imagine anything more abhorrent for a Jewish boy where pigs
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.220]   were unclean?
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.420]   He was left feeding the pigs.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:57.580]   And he thinks to himself, "Even the servants in my dad's house live better than this.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:03.240]   Oh, I've cut myself off from shunship, I know, but this is second best.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.960]   It's much better than feeding the pigs.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.460]   Maybe he'll take me back as a servant."
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:17.540]   It's a bit like us.
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:25.320]   We think to ourselves, "If God knew me as I really was, he'd never have me as his son
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.760]   or daughter."
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.480]   This is how so many people think.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.040]   And it is wrong thinking.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:51.820]   While the son has been away, the father has been on the porch, watching, waiting for his
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:55.080]   son to come home.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:04.160]   And note this, the son had said, in effect, "You are no longer my father."
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:11.360]   The father has never said, never said that you are no longer my son.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.040]   He's been waiting and waiting.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.280]   Next we see that the son got partially in.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:25.440]   "Dad, I've sinned.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.320]   I'm ashamed.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:33.060]   I'm unworthy of your name."
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.800]   But then he shows his father's love is not fully revealed to him.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.360]   He says, "Take me back as your servant."
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:49.560]   I need to tell you today, our God is not looking for servants, but for sons and daughters.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.160]   Let me say that again, this is important.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:32:00.000]   Our God is not looking for servants, but for sons and daughters.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.840]   This is what so much of the 21st century church has got wrong.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.760]   If I serve God, I'll deserve His love.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.080]   Wrong.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:19.080]   Sadly, it is so prevalent in our city, in our society.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:27.360]   Hong Kong Christians love to try and earn God's love by doing more for Him.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.520]   If I pray more, if I read the Bible more, if I attend more church meetings, if I volunteer,
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:39.480]   if I love more, I will earn brownie points with God.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:52.240]   This isn't what the father in the prodigal son story had in mind, or our father.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.560]   He's waiting.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.880]   Then he sees the son.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:03.120]   Now, I don't know if you were the father, what your natural reaction would be.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.040]   Probably this, "I'll wait till he comes home.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.240]   I'll make him grovel."
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:13.880]   "I told you so.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.720]   Let's keep him on tender hooks."
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:23.440]   But no, he runs after his son.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.720]   Hebrew fathers didn't do that.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.200]   He lifts up his robe, undignified.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.760]   They didn't do that either.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:38.880]   In our Hong Kong parlance, he loses face.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.120]   I ask you, what earthly father would do this?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:49.000]   Yet, this is what our heavenly father does time and time and time again.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.040]   It gets better.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.640]   Bring out the robe.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.480]   Bring out the sandals, a ring for his finger.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:06.040]   The robe, ring, and sandals show the father's high level of love, honor, authority for the
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.920]   son.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   By giving those gifts, the father distinguished his son from the servants.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.920]   It went further.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.280]   "Let's throw a party.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.120]   Let's kill the fatty calf.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.000]   Let's have filet mignon.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:38.680]   Your place is in the front room with your feet up and a beer in your hands."
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.120]   Sonship is pure grace.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.040]   Let me say that again.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.160]   Sonship is pure grace.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:59.480]   Nothing to do with what you have done right or wrong for that matter.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:08.800]   Vine Yuen Long, he's calling out to you.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:19.520]   In our passage today, Paul has clearly indicated that the Galatian Christians were foolish
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:26.760]   in believing they needed to follow the law of Moses to be right with God.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:32.960]   I want to challenge you right now.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.320]   Put down your job.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.360]   Put down your achievements.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:50.920]   Put down your roles and run into the arms of the father.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:36:00.120]   Just give a minute for the Holy Spirit to speak to you on that.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.880]   You know what you'll find in the arms of the father?
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:10.360]   The only thing you'll find is grace.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:16.640]   I want to close with some words from a song, "Run to the Father" by worship leader Cody
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.480]   Cairns.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.240]   "I run to the father.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.120]   I fall into grace.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.520]   I'm done with the hiding.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.720]   No reason to wait.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.040]   My heart needs a surgeon.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.000]   My soul needs a friend.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:55.560]   So I run to the father again and again and again."
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:13.480]   As I ask the worship team to come back, I want you to stand and pray for us.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.400]   I wish I had time this morning to ask you all to run to the front and I'd give you a
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.160]   big, big dad's hug.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:24.880]   I'll give you that in spirit today.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:33.640]   I ask you just to maybe stretch your hands in front of you.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:45.000]   And just maybe point your hands downwards as you let go of all those things that the
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:57.320]   world defines you as.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:05.120]   You're more than your job, your achievements, your role in life.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.800]   Just lay them down.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:18.840]   I decide today I'm not going to be a slave to those things anymore.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:25.520]   And just lift your hands upwards to God.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.520]   I run to the father.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.920]   I fall into grace.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:43.120]   I run to the father again and again and again.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:49.520]   "Father, put your arms around me.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:54.040]   Tell me I'm your son.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.900]   I'm your daughter.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.480]   You love me.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.880]   You are proud of me.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:11.760]   It's not because of what I've done, but Jesus, because of who you are and what you
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.280]   did for me on the cross."
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.860]   (gentle music)
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.440]   (gentle music)
