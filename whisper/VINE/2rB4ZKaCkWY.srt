1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
 Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Pastor Tim.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,000
 And thank you everyone for coming into church today.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,600
 I'm really happy to see you at church.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,640
 I just was just telling my friend that

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,440
 remember the time when we had to worship alone

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,880
 in our house, in our apartment, facing the TV?

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,440
 Because it was pandemic, right?

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,240
 And everyone had to stay indoors

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,200
 and we had to worship on our own.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,360
 And there's no fun in it, actually.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,560
 The really enjoying part,

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
 but the really good part about worshiping

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,200
 is that when we all come together

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,880
 and all enjoy each other's singing.

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,360
 And I think that every time I come to worship,

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,280
 I just find it pure joy.

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,000
 I can get to immerse myself into the music,

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,040
 into the worship and just praise God.

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,880
 And there's nothing more wonderful than that.

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,760
 And I think every time when we talk about worship,

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,640
 immediately think about the musical part, right?

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
 I wonder if you ever thought about

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,920
 why every time people talk about,

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,000
 "Let's worship God," you go,

25
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,520
 "Okay, I'm ready to sing,"

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,480
 or "I'm not ready to sing."

27
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,560
 Singing is very integral, very important

28
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,000
 in the worship part because it engages our whole body,

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
 our whole being.

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,360
 You actually physically have to stand up

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,800
 and move and to worship.

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,960
 You engage yourself emotionally

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,320
 when you think about God, the glory of God,

34
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,680
 and you want to express your adoration

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,800
 and your love to God.

36
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,280
 Also, sometimes you also have to engage your mind

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,960
 to think about what was being sung.

38
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,040
 And you can join in with the worship team

39
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,240
 to sing something beautiful.

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,440
 My friend once told me that after the Sunday service,

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,560
 what really stuck in their mind was not the sermon,

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,720
 but what was sung during the worship.

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,720
 The music, the lyrics actually accompany them

44
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,680
 throughout the week.

45
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,520
 It was not so much about the sermon,

46
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,440
 but the music really gets into your heart.

47
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,440
 And I've got to be honest with you,

48
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,000
 there was a season in my life

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 where I loved singing so much

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,440
 that I put all my energy, all my heart,

51
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,160
 and all my soul into worship.

52
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
 And then after the worship part,

53
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,640
 I just fell back into my chair and go,

54
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,120
 I cannot do this anymore.

55
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,920
 And I find it very difficult to connect with the sermon,

56
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,000
 to connect with the announcement later on,

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,960
 because it just took all of my energy

58
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,040
 and all of my engagement into the singing part.

59
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,760
 But this is not what I want.

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,040
 I want to link the effort, the concentration,

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,560
 and the enjoyment I have in the music part

62
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,480
 of the worship to the rest of the Sunday service.

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,120
 Not only that, I want the same commitment,

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,920
 the same zeal and passion into my work,

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,960
 my home, my relationships,

66
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,920
 because I know that worship is not just the music.

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,600
 It's not the moment.

68
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,080
 It's supposed to be the way I live.

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,640
 How can this transformative worship

70
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,640
 that we have experienced empower us

71
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,520
 to live a life of worship?

72
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,720
 We are going back to the book of Isaiah today.

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,000
 Isaiah was one of the major prophets in the Old Testament.

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,640
 This was the turbulence time when Isaiah was prophesying,

75
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,480
 because there was such a lot going on in Israel.

76
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,560
 At that time, Israel was already split into two,

77
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,400
 and Isaiah was looking after a prophesying

78
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,240
 in the northern part of the Israel called Judah.

79
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,680
 And so let's read Isaiah 6, chapter one,

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,560
 verse one together.

81
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,200
 In the year of the king Uzziah died,

82
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,040
 I saw the Lord high and exalted,

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
 seating on a throne.

84
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,400
 This is an important thing to note.

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,240
 The encounter happened during the time

86
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,680
 when king Uzziah died.

87
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,560
 King Uzziah was a good and wise king.

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,880
 He reigned for about 52 years

89
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,480
 in the northern kingdom during Israel's split,

90
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
 providing a long period of time

91
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,120
 of stability and prosperity for Judah.

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,160
 He also lead Judah into military victories

93
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,640
 over the Philistines and other neighboring nations.

94
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,160
 In 2 Kings, chapter 15, verse three,

95
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,760
 the Bible says that he did what was right

96
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,480
 in the sight of the Lord.

97
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
 So to say in the year that king Uzziah died

98
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,960
 waited a lot in Isaiah's heart.

99
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,360
 Uzziah wasn't perfect, but he was compared,

100
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,440
 but he was very good compared to the kings before them

101
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,440
 who always swing between obedience and idolatry.

102
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,080
 Uzziah brought spiritual revival to Israel

103
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,760
 with his dedication to worship God.

104
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,720
 Now that Uzziah died,

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,200
 who is going to lead Israel after him?

106
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,000
 Who's going to continue this obedience to God

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
 after Uzziah?

108
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,400
 Isaiah was worried and he was disheartened

109
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,960
 and he was confused.

110
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,360
 What is going to become of the future of Israel

111
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,160
 when this king died?

112
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,760
 And this is the moment when God encounter,

113
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,840
 let Uzziah to encounter him.

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,560
 This was the moment when Isaiah was feeling weighted down,

115
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,960
 when he was feeling confused and remorse

116
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,280
 over the diseased king and hung his hope on the new one,

117
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,200
 God showed himself to Isaiah.

118
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,160
 High and exalted, as the verse continues to say,

119
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,480
 high and exalted, sitting on a throne,

120
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,720
 with the train of his rope, fill the temple.

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,160
 Above him were seraphims, each with six wings.

122
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
 With two wings, they covered their faces

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,920
 and two, they covered their feet

124
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,720
 and two, they were flying

125
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,760
 and they were calling to each other,

126
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,760
 holy, holy, holy is the Lord almighty.

127
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,480
 The whole earth is filled with his glory.

128
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,120
 At the sound of their voices,

129
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,200
 the doorsteps and the trash hole shook

130
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,560
 and the temples were filled with smoke.

131
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,200
 God showed Uzziah,

132
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,400
 God showed Isaiah who the real king was,

133
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,120
 who the real king was.

134
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,160
 Not only that, God make sure

135
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,720
 that this is not on a cognitive level

136
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,640
 where Isaiah will go, okay, this is,

137
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,240
 I know that God is great, I know that God is big.

138
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,200
 No, he let Isaiah to experience his greatness.

139
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,560
 Look at the description on the verses.

140
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,400
 It didn't say that God is big

141
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,160
 and then he just looked at it.

142
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,440
 It described that Isaiah saw the train of the rope

143
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,640
 fill the temple and this is not the temple of the size.

144
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,520
 Imagine that the rope of God's rope

145
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,280
 fill the whole street of this street.

146
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,720
 You will really have to lift up your head

147
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,920
 and to see this magnificent God.

148
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,880
 The sight itself is very overwhelming

149
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,440
 and then it continued to say

150
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,640
 that the sound of the seraphim singing

151
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,520
 shook the threshold and the temple itself.

152
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,440
 And the way that this sound is big

153
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,040
 is not just hearing it, but it was being felt.

154
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,960
 And this enormous, glorious God that Isaiah see,

155
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,120
 it's overwhelming him.

156
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,720
 And he sees this God, not only that he is big in itself,

157
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,720
 but he is actually, he's actually the Lord sovereign God.

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,080
 And so it puts Isaiah's grief into perspective.

159
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,640
 When God encountered Isaiah,

160
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,440
 Uzziah didn't come back to life.

161
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,200
 The confusion, the sadness, everything didn't vanish,

162
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,160
 but Isaiah's faith grew.

163
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,080
 Isaiah's faith grew because he saw God for who he is.

164
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,640
 He is the real king.

165
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,720
 He is the everlasting king.

166
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,160
 That the mortal kings comes and go,

167
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,080
 but this is the king that is going to stay.

168
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,240
 He's the king that whatever he said

169
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,440
 is going to come alive.

170
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,480
 Whatever he's gonna do is going to come through.

171
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,880
 So no matter who, which king comes after him,

172
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,200
 the king that Isaiah worshiped

173
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,840
 is going to reign forever and ever.

174
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,080
 And this sense, it's revelation of God,

175
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,960
 this awesomeness that Isaiah experienced

176
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,480
 led him to know that,

177
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
 led him to know that this is the king

178
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,640
 that I need to worship.

179
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,760
 And so God showed Isaiah that he need not be confused

180
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,640
 and nervous about the future,

181
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,040
 that God reigns.

182
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,120
 Uzziah might have died,

183
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
 but God revealed to Isaiah

184
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,960
 that he is the everlasting king.

185
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,520
 The revelation of who God is

186
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,440
 has put Isaiah's grief into perspective.

187
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,640
 And then the third film,

188
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,400
 that is the angel singing,

189
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,320
 plays a significant role in this narrative.

190
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,560
 They were singing, "Holy, holy, holy."

191
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,800
 The meaning of the word actually is to set apart.

192
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,280
 This apartness is not only the difference

193
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,720
 in height or in power,

194
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,360
 he is also set apart from all that is evil,

195
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,880
 sinful, unclean, and impure in this world.

196
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,720
 What happens when you encounter this holiness?

197
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,760
 You realize how sinful you are.

198
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,360
 The easiest way to understand this is my white trainers.

199
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,480
 I thought my trainers were white,

200
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,520
 but then when I compare it to someone

201
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,080
 that just bought their trainers,

202
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,680
 I know that mine fail in comparison.

203
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,240
 It's pale yellow.

204
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,960
 It's really yucky color, right?

205
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,280
 Our understanding of a clean and upright life

206
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,560
 cannot be compared to the holiness of God.

207
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,200
 And so what did Isaiah do when God revealed himself,

208
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,400
 showed himself to him that way?

209
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,600
 Isaiah cried, "Woe to me, I am ruined,

210
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
 "for I'm a man of unclean lips,

211
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,280
 "and I live among a people of unclean lips,

212
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,880
 "and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty."

213
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,560
 In the message translation, he puts it this way,

214
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,960
 "Doom, it's doomsday, I'm as good as dead.

215
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,080
 "Every word I've spoken is tainted, blasphemous even."

216
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
 At the sight of this holy Lord,

217
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,160
 Isaiah felt painful at the sinfulness and confessed his sin.

218
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,440
 This was not a script that he knew

219
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,840
 that he needed to recite, nor this is the flow,

220
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,000
 worship is not a flow or a script that he needs to follow.

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,920
 This is his honest reaction to confess his sin,

222
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,440
 to repent when he meets the Holy One.

223
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,680
 Worship is not a script.

224
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,320
 Worship is our response when God reveals himself.

225
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,480
 I don't know if you've ever experienced this.

226
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,360
 Maybe you come into worship and you praise,

227
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,320
 but then suddenly the sense of God's holiness

228
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,480
 just overcomes you and you can't sing anymore.

229
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,720
 But you have to do something to respond

230
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,280
 to what God was saying to you at that moment.

231
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,880
 And so whether it's crying or praying

232
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,680
 or kneeling down to confess,

233
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,000
 you were worshiping at the beginning,

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,800
 but then you went into a deeper level of worship

235
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,440
 because of what was revealed to you.

236
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,200
 True worship is not about saying the right thing

237
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,120
 and moving the right way.

238
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,160
 True worship is the response we make

239
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,320
 when our hearts are moved by his revelation.

240
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,240
 Isaiah sees God as King of Kings

241
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,120
 and he sees God as the Holy One.

242
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,760
 His whole body, mind and soul was captured

243
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,120
 by God's revelation of himself.

244
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,000
 His reaction was to lower himself and confess his sin.

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,200
 And that is his worship to God.

246
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,320
 Worship is the response we make

247
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,400
 when our hearts are moved by his revelation.

248
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,280
 So what do you see when you worship?

249
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,480
 What do you focus on when you step into the space?

250
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,720
 Do you see the band sometimes and just admire them?

251
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,520
 Do you see others and think about

252
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,760
 the relationship you have with them?

253
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,120
 Maybe you have friends here and you step into the space

254
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,080
 and you really wanted to connect with your friends.

255
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,400
 Do you see yourself out of place maybe,

256
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,920
 trying to fit in or do what every other one is doing

257
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,840
 and try to worship as others worship?

258
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,600
 I remember the first time when I stepped

259
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,520
 into the Fine Wan Chai.

260
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,040
 The worship team was singing the most upbeat song,

261
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,840
 trying to get everyone's focus

262
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,760
 and to celebrate God's goodness.

263
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
 And I just stepped into the church that time

264
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,840
 feeling very downhearted.

265
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,840
 I just came out of a church that they,

266
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,040
 normally they always told me to sing louder

267
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,760
 and be more hyped because I need to show

268
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,520
 a really good example to the people that is behind me.

269
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,560
 I step out of that kind of work, righteous behavior,

270
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,760
 knowing that I need to do something for the church.

271
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,880
 I need to do something for God to show that I love him.

272
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,080
 But when I step into that atmosphere,

273
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,520
 when I step into the space and hear the song singing,

274
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,840
 God's love never runs out on you.

275
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,080
 His love is forever and he is great and awesome.

276
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,320
 My heart was not going upbeat and saying

277
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,800
 happy, clappy songs.

278
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,080
 My heart actually was broken

279
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,440
 because I know that the love of God

280
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,960
 comes and fills into my heart and I just started crying.

281
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,720
 My worship wasn't the songs that I sing.

282
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,240
 My worship was not the way that I posture myself.

283
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,800
 My worship is the way I broke down

284
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,640
 and I told God that I can't sing anymore.

285
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,920
 My heart is not ready yet, but my tears are coming out

286
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,040
 because I know your love for me is real.

287
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,440
 And I just want to tell you,

288
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
 when you come into the space today,

289
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,080
 when you come in and you see friends

290
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,720
 and you see the team and you see

291
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,040
 everything happening so wonderfully,

292
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,680
 also take a moment to see what God is talking to you.

293
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,160
 What is he showing you and revealing to you?

294
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,600
 When we say that true worship

295
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,840
 is not about saying the right thing,

296
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,200
 when we say true worship is the response we make,

297
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,120
 when our hearts are moved by his revelation,

298
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,120
 what is he revealing to you today?

299
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,920
 Is he telling you about his holiness?

300
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,480
 Is he telling you about his greatness?

301
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,520
 How is your heart moved today?

302
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,280
 Let's keep going and read Isaiah chapter six,

303
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,320
 verse six to seven.

304
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,880
 Then one of the seraphim flew to me

305
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,080
 with a life-cold in his hand,

306
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,280
 which he had taken from tongs from the altar.

307
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,080
 When he, with it, he touched my mouth and said,

308
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,920
 "See, this has touched your lips.

309
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,080
 "Your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for."

310
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,440
 Isaiah is rightly afraid of the fire of the Lord

311
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,040
 that will lash out against him.

312
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,960
 He specifically feel the corruption of his tongue,

313
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,320
 the very instrument of his prophetic ministry.

314
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,640
 And he feels the corruption of his people as well.

315
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,800
 But the Lord of glory is also the Lord of grace.

316
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,960
 And instead of killing the sinner that he deserves,

317
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,640
 he reveals his mercy to Isaiah.

318
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,880
 As the angel touched Isaiah's lips with the life-cold,

319
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,320
 it said, "See, this has touched your lips.

320
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,760
 "Your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for."

321
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,080
 Not because Isaiah said the right thing

322
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,880
 or he did anything to deserve this,

323
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,400
 nor could he do anything that he could fix his past

324
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,720
 and get his relationship right with God again.

325
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,600
 This is totally God's doing, totally God's extending,

326
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,120
 actively extending his mercy and grace to Isaiah.

327
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,560
 So what do you do when forgiveness of your sin

328
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,560
 and offenses is offered freely like that?

329
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,640
 How do you respond?

330
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,040
 Maybe you could remember a time when you encountered God

331
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,440
 and you became aware of your sin,

332
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,280
 but God also extends his grace and forgiveness to you.

333
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,360
 And what did you do?

334
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,520
 You accepted, you can only accept it.

335
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,320
 And you say, "Thank you, God.

336
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,560
 "I need this forgiveness, thank you."

337
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,080
 And the response is worship, and that is worship.

338
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,800
 No music, no scripted lines,

339
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,080
 but when our hearts is moved by God's revelation,

340
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,680
 our response to him, to honor him,

341
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,160
 to acknowledge him is worship.

342
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,640
 And when our response is our worship to God,

343
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,440
 then we're not only worshiping when we're singing,

344
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,880
 we worship when we see God in prayers,

345
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,880
 we worship by responding by amen.

346
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,240
 When we see God in the preaching of the word

347
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,360
 and we take it to heart and think about it

348
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,840
 and we pray for each other, that is worshiping.

349
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,360
 And when the seeing and responding doesn't stop here,

350
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,520
 the amazing thing is as when we step out of this door

351
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,520
 and into the world and we see God's loving heart,

352
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,400
 we see God's mercy in this world,

353
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,600
 we see what God wants to do in this world,

354
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,200
 and we partner with God to respond to it that way

355
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,760
 by loving our neighbors,

356
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,400
 by serving and diligently in our workplaces,

357
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,600
 by healing and restoring relationship,

358
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,240
 trying our best to forgive or ask for forgiveness,

359
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,720
 we are worshiping God.

360
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,760
 And so we are worshiping God when we respond to him

361
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,640
 inside and outside of this church,

362
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,280
 on Sunday and every other day of the week,

363
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,840
 because he is worthy.

364
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,160
 And so in verse eight, when God reveals his will to Isaiah,

365
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,560
 he responded.

366
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,320
 And so let's look at the scripture together.

367
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,760
 In verse eight it says,

368
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,480
 "Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying,

369
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,600
 'Whom shall I send and who will go for us?'

370
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,080
 And I say, 'Here am I, send me.'"

371
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,720
 Maybe you've been posed by this question before.

372
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,880
 There is always so much to do here and there.

373
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,520
 And maybe there are times when you put your hands up

374
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,960
 because you see the need in teams and ministries.

375
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,000
 And for that, I thank you very much

376
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,640
 from the bottom of our hearts.

377
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,080
 We are so grateful for that

378
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,280
 because this church can only do what churches should do

379
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,000
 because of your contribution,

380
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,560
 because that you see the need

381
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,120
 and you respond to the need or our invitation.

382
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,480
 And I can see that many of you

383
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
 are actually serving in different teams

384
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,360
 and not only serving in teams,

385
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,640
 the fact that you're coming into this church today

386
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
 is serving each other.

387
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,160
 And I just really am so thankful for that.

388
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,840
 In the morning session, when I was talking to a friend,

389
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,680
 he just came back from a really big surgery.

390
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,040
 He had a big event, had a big surgery,

391
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,240
 and he came back and he said,

392
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,160
 "I am so touched by the fact that my brothers and sisters,

393
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,720
 my family in this church remembers me,

394
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,200
 smiled at me, and just to be with me."

395
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,440
 He was so lonely when he was worshiping

396
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,560
 in this hospital and at home,

397
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,840
 but when he come back and we see chairs are being filled,

398
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,120
 he sees that the family of Christ coming together,

399
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,640
 it heals his heart.

400
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,440
 And your service to God is not just the things that you do,

401
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,240
 but because of who you are,

402
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,160
 that you need to recognize that you are saved by God.

403
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,680
 And the fact that you step into church today,

404
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,080
 worshiping together,

405
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,920
 is your response to God's calling in your life.

406
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,680
 But I hope that as you continue to serve,

407
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,120
 as you continue to move,

408
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,760
 we realize the ultimate reason that we serve

409
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,400
 is not because we're answering to someone's invitation,

410
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,720
 that we're coming here to serve,

411
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,800
 not because we see the needs and we need to fulfill it.

412
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,320
 It's because you see the revelation of God

413
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,560
 moving in your heart,

414
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,480
 that you are not responding to people,

415
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,600
 but you're responding to God.

416
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,520
 In the past, I used to play piano.

417
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,480
 I used to know how to play piano.

418
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,680
 So because of that, my church,

419
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,000
 I've been to a few churches,

420
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,480
 and the churches always ask me to play piano,

421
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,240
 and it just makes me so stressed and in such pain.

422
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,280
 I don't really like playing the piano.

423
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,840
 I'm very bad at it.

424
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,360
 But when they ask, they say,

425
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,680
 "June, but you're the only person

426
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,240
 "that can play the piano now.

427
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,400
 "So you have to step up and play."

428
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,480
 And I step up, but I have a grudge in my heart.

429
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,360
 You know, he had grade A piano too.

430
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,040
 She went to that competition and he won something.

431
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,160
 Why don't they serve?

432
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,840
 Why is it always me?

433
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,160
 And I carry that to serve.

434
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,200
 And although it went well,

435
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,120
 although the church was built,

436
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,320
 my heart is always have a slight scrunch, right?

437
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,160
 And it's not because of the church invitation.

438
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,240
 It's actually because how I see my service.

439
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,400
 I see that I'm fulfilling a spot.

440
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,440
 I'm fulfilling someone's expectation, and so I serve.

441
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,800
 And so the joy was taken out of me.

442
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,040
 Fast forward to the Vine, right?

443
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,320
 Oh, so that's not the end of the story.

444
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,840
 How did I get out of it?

445
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,120
 I had this really expensive piano at home.

446
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,200
 I used to, okay, I had this really expensive piano at home.

447
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,160
 To get out of serving in churches, I just give it away.

448
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,360
 I didn't even wait to sell it.

449
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,520
 I just, "Here you go.

450
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,920
 "I have no piano at home right now.

451
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,840
 "Please don't ask me to play anymore."

452
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,280
 And so that's the end of my musical career in piano.

453
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,840
 But then fast forward to the Vine Yunlong,

454
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,520
 the startup of the Vine Yunlong.

455
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,320
 There was a time when the worship team

456
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,320
 has only one musical player, musician.

457
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,000
 And he was trying really hard to play

458
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
 on every single services, right?

459
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
 It's not just a Sunday service at that time.

460
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,960
 There were Alva, there were lots of going on,

461
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,160
 and he is the only one.

462
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,320
 And I'm also on the team.

463
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,200
 I was singing at that time.

464
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,200
 And because I want to communicate better with the musician,

465
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,280
 I actually took back piano lessons again.

466
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,720
 And so, don't you...

467
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,280
 (laughs)

468
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,440
 I'm so glad that there's a full team all the time right now.

469
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
 They still need people,

470
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,000
 but I know that I don't need to depend on.

471
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,320
 But I'm just going to say that when I respond,

472
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,440
 when you see God's heart in you,

473
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,840
 when you see God's revelation to you,

474
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,720
 that you will step up to serve

475
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,760
 no matter how challenging it is or how difficult it is.

476
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,200
 Because you will then find the strength to serve.

477
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,600
 Then you'll find the joy to serve.

478
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200
 And that is totally different.

479
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,000
 And I don't even, I don't just,

480
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,040
 this is just my example, by the way.

481
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,160
 I can see lots of brothers and sisters

482
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,040
 and people coming to this church here

483
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,600
 have that same compassion, have that same zeal.

484
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,880
 Just yesterday, Amshanti has this back to school drive

485
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,560
 where they need people to donate

486
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,720
 because there are people who don't have

487
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,640
 enough resources for school.

488
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,000
 Not only people in this church donate

489
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
 to this back to school drive,

490
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,080
 they actually go and start giving out

491
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,200
 and loving on the people that need these resources.

492
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,760
 And I just want to say they don't do this

493
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,440
 because they are responding to people's invitation,

494
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,600
 because they receive God's mercy and God's grace,

495
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,480
 and they want to share it that way.

496
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,440
 And I want to talk about the impact that it has.

497
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,440
 So last time when we were in our monthly prayer meeting,

498
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,840
 we prayed specifically for Shanti.

499
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,120
 And they were sharing that the kids there,

500
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,920
 the kids that goes to Shanti,

501
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,360
 sometimes they feel the bully or the discrimination

502
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,040
 from their community, in the schools that they're in,

503
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,160
 or in the neighborhood that they're in.

504
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,160
 And the fact that we go as a community in their community

505
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,160
 to go and love for them, to pray for them,

506
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,040
 not only they're getting the resources,

507
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,640
 not only they're hearing the words of God,

508
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,400
 but they're actually feeling the embrace,

509
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,720
 the love from this community

510
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,280
 that they have received hurt from,

511
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,840
 the Hong Kong community maybe,

512
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,280
 or the schools that they are in,

513
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,800
 that they have experienced this discrimination.

514
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,360
 But because of us going, because of us loving there,

515
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,320
 something shifted and something broke out.

516
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,800
 And I'm just so thankful for the people

517
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,640
 that responded to God's call,

518
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,960
 that they see that they've received God's love,

519
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,760
 and then they spread it out, and then they pour it in.

520
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,200
 And that's worship.

521
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,120
 Worship is not the songs that we sing here,

522
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,520
 but worship is the way that we respond

523
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,440
 when we see the revelation of God's love

524
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,600
 and holiness into our lives.

525
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,960
 And so,

526
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,320
 at the beginning of the worship series,

527
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,960
 Pastor Chapman talked about Romans 12, verse one.

528
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,240
 "In view of God's mercy,

529
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,160
 "offer your bodies as living sacrifices,

530
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,680
 "holy and acceptable to God."

531
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,720
 Doesn't it sound familiar

532
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,600
 with what we talked about in Isaiah today?

533
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,240
 Paul is saying, do you see God's mercy?

534
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,680
 Do you receive this revelation?

535
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,880
 If you do, respond to it by living for God.

536
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,160
 And so, if we do that, if we receive and respond

537
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,320
 in our communities, in our homes, in our workplaces,

538
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,160
 we're all actually moving temples.

539
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,360
 That we're not just coming here and worship

540
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,760
 and then go back to our lives.

541
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,000
 We're actually bringing a part of the temple

542
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 into our workplace, into the broken relationships,

543
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 into the schools, into the neighborhood that we are in,

544
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,280
 so that people can come and see the God

545
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,960
 that revealed Himself.

546
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,280
 That people, through the way that we serve,

547
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,800
 can see the way that God loves,

548
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,640
 and they can come and see this God.

549
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,400
 And so, I urge you,

550
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,920
 in revelation, in view of God's love to you,

551
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,120
 in view of God's mercy to you,

552
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,040
 come and respond to it.

553
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,320
 Maybe you don't have to respond by singing.

554
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,400
 Maybe you are responding

555
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,120
 by extending your forgiveness to people.

556
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,440
 Maybe you are responding by asking for forgiveness.

557
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,960
 Maybe you're responding

558
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,240
 by just doing a really good job at work,

559
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,760
 because you know that you are set apart.

560
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
 The way that your colleagues work, maybe don't cut it.

561
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,160
 Maybe it's not the right way,

562
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,560
 even though every single one is doing it.

563
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,400
 But you come into work and you say, "I am set apart,

564
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,520
 and I'm going to respond to God that way in my workplace."

565
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,400
 It may not be the most efficient.

566
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,960
 It may not be the most profitable,

567
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,480
 but this is how I'm going to see myself,

568
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,160
 because I see that God is holy.

569
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,120
 Maybe you step into your school,

570
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,800
 knowing that, "I know I'm not going to be the popular kid,

571
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,200
 but I want to step into this school knowing that God loves me,

572
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,880
 and I want to love those unpopular ones.

573
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,480
 I want to extend this friendly hand,

574
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,760
 this friendliness to the people that often,

575
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,240
 you know, I don't really see eye to eye with."

576
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,600
 Receive God's revelation, church, in our worship today.

577
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
 That's why we come.

578
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,240
 That's why we gather.

579
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,120
 We gather not to spend our morning together.

580
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,360
 We come to spend our time together,

581
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:13,400
 so that when we go out, we carry this revelation with us.

582
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,120
 And I want to invite the worship team to come back up again.

583
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,240
 And as we step into this worship time,

584
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,120
 in response to what God has been revealing to us today,

585
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,440
 I want you to open your hearts.

586
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,280
 I want you to open your hearts and ask God,

587
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,600
 "What have you revealed to me today in church?

588
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,720
 What part of you do I see?

589
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,080
 And how do you want me to respond to you?"

590
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,200
 And so I'm going to let the worship team

591
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,560
 to lead us into a part of worship,

592
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,280
 and let's all stand and worship.
