1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 As you sit down, can I encourage you to squeeze in a little bit?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,720
 There is an empty seat next to you.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,880
 Could you just put your hand up in the upper house and lower house?

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,440
 Our host, the overflow is full, but there are a few people standing around,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,480
 and we would love to be able to get them a seat.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,040
 So if you have an empty seat next to you, just throw your hand up in the air,

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,760
 and we will try and make sure we can seat as many people as possible.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,600
 Otherwise, you're more than welcome to stand here and around,

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,000
 or just sit on the floor as well.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
 We're happy for that, too.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,080
 We're just grateful that everybody is here.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,480
 We don't want anyone to miss out on what the Holy Spirit is saying and doing.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,040
 One of the things that we've noticed here at the Vine over the last little while

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
 is that the Lord is doing a new thing amongst us.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
 And when the Lord does a new thing, it's important for us to just pause,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,080
 and just to name, and understand, and recognize the new thing that God is doing.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,480
 Not because we want to stop that thing,

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,200
 not because we want to try to contain what the Lord is doing,

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,720
 but because we actually want to do the opposite.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,320
 We want to release it and fan it into flame, and see it happen all the more.

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,920
 And sometimes when we understand what it is that God is doing,

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
 it enables us to then just continue to get out of the way,

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,040
 and then let Him continue to do what He wants to do in us.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
 And in two weeks' time, we've got Vision Sunday here at the Vine,

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,800
 and I want to talk specifically,

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,880
 and I want to put some very specific flesh and bones around what it is

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,640
 that I think God is doing in the new thing that He's doing in this season

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,840
 that we're here as a church, and particularly the call that is on us,

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,960
 and how we can consecrate ourselves towards that call in the year ahead.

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,240
 So in two weeks' time, I'm looking forward to unpacking that.

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,560
 But as I was sort of sitting over the last couple of weeks,

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,640
 and just preparing my heart for Vision Sunday,

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
 thinking about what passages to be preaching from,

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,920
 I felt like the Lord laid on my heart another message,

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,920
 a message that needed to be preached before Vision Sunday,

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,600
 that really encapsulates the why of this new season that we're in,

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,480
 the why of what God is doing by His Spirit last week, this week,

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,400
 and ongoing amongst us.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,320
 We've been saying to you, haven't we, that this is to be a year

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,800
 where the Lord is shifting us out of a year of intimacy in 2024,

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
 to a year of action in 2025.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,840
 And we've been specifically saying that the Lord is calling us

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,600
 to live our faith more publicly in the year ahead.

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,320
 And so what I want to do this morning is help us to understand the why

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,640
 of why God is calling us to be much more public with our faith.

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
 And it connects so much to the picture and the word

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,040
 that Susannah and Karen carried for us to not be hiding our identity

48
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,400
 in the places of spirit of influence that God has put us in,

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
 but for us to fly the banner of Jesus Christ

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,200
 in prophetic, important, wise, humble, but beautiful ways

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,960
 in the city of Hong Kong, a city that we love so much.

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,800
 What we need to understand, I think, first of all,

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,920
 is that when God moves amongst His people,

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,640
 when there is an activity of God that is new amongst His people,

55
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,960
 His people always respond in worship and adoration.

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,680
 There has to be a connection between the move of God

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,440
 and the release of praise, the release of honor,

58
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,520
 the release of worship, glorification of the church to Him.

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,160
 I think that's profoundly what we saw last week.

60
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,400
 I think we've sensed that amongst us here.

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,080
 And one of the things that I'm so grateful for,

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,680
 my wife and I have been a part of the Vine

63
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,160
 pretty much since the beginning, almost 30 years now.

64
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,960
 One thing that I know that we're so grateful for

65
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,840
 is that the Lord has always blessed this community

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,200
 with a deep sense of His presence when we gather together on a Sunday.

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,040
 Worship has always been something that has been fundamental

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
 to the life of the Vine Church.

69
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,960
 When we hold our newcomers events, we've got one coming up shortly,

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,800
 when we hold our newcomers events and we ask people,

71
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
 "Why are you coming to the Vine?

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,600
 How did you hear about the Vine?"

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,200
 Almost nine out of 10 people will say, "I'm here because of the worship.

74
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,920
 I'm here because when I come here..."

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,040
 And they're not just meaning the musicians and the singers

76
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,560
 and all the stuff that we do on the stage, as good as some of them are.

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,960
 What we're meaning and what their meaning is,

78
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,120
 "When I come to the Vine, I feel the presence of God.

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,800
 There's the presence of God amongst us, and that draws me to want to be here.

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,440
 I know when I show up, the Holy Spirit speaks to me.

81
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,200
 I know that there's an encounter with God.

82
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,680
 I love our corporate worship times."

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,720
 And again, we celebrate what the Lord has been doing amongst us over these 30 years.

84
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,280
 And I think now, even in a new season of deepening His presence

85
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,200
 and the worship that is happening here at the Vine on Sundays.

86
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,160
 Now, here's the danger though, when that takes place in a community

87
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,200
 and in a corporate body.

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,640
 The danger is that we begin to think that that's the totality of what worship is.

89
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,160
 Because it's such an amazing experience,

90
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,040
 because when we come in for those 90 minutes on a Sunday

91
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,760
 and we experience the presence of God, we begin to define that as worship.

92
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,800
 And we begin to think that that is the totality, the sum whole purpose of worship.

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,680
 And we even begin to use language like, "I'm going to go to worship on Sunday."

94
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,120
 And of course, when we come in here, of course we do worship.

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,120
 That's the beautiful thing of what happens in this room.

96
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,440
 But we've got to be very careful that we don't make that the sum total

97
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,520
 of what God means in worship.

98
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,840
 Because if we do, then what we're going to end up doing is only looking to this 90 minutes

99
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,080
 and thinking that this is the way and the fullness of who God is

100
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
 and begin to diminish the reality of what God's doing out there.

101
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,320
 You see, I think in a year when God's calling the Vine into a year of action,

102
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,560
 when he's calling a church to live their lives and their faith more publicly in the year ahead,

103
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,400
 we cannot begin to do that unless we redefine how we think about worship

104
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,240
 from an experience in a room to a lifestyle in the world.

105
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
 Come on, church.

106
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,880
 We've got to begin to think differently about what worship is.

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,720
 That worship isn't just, and it is this amazing thing we're doing here,

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,480
 but that's not the totality of it.

109
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,040
 And as we begin to shift our thinking from an experience in a room

110
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,720
 to a lifestyle that we live in the world, then worship begins to say something

111
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,440
 to the broken and the lost and the hurting and the vulnerable,

112
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,040
 which is the reason why the church exists in the first place.

113
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,680
 The church does not exist to be a holy huddle.

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,280
 The church does not exist so that people would feel comfortable and happy.

115
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,400
 The church exists because God wants to save sinners.

116
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,600
 He wants to bring people into his kingdom.

117
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,520
 That he's longing to see people have their lives dramatically changed.

118
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,840
 And while we will continue to do all that we can to ensure

119
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,040
 that the presence of God is primary in our gatherings,

120
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,080
 while we'll continue to invest our resources and energy

121
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,640
 to what happens when we gather like this on a Sunday,

122
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,840
 we've got to realize that this is not the totality of what worship is.

123
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,800
 And we've got to understand that actually what we're doing here

124
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,640
 is a modern expression.

125
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,520
 It doesn't mean that it's a bad thing.

126
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,080
 It just means that this is a modern thing that we're doing.

127
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,600
 And that scripture paints a picture of worship

128
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,320
 that is much broader and deeper and wider and more glorious and more public

129
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,000
 than I think in the modern church we come to realize.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,960
 Could it be that one of the new things that God is saying amongst us

131
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,000
 is that our worship and ultimately our faith is far too private?

132
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,760
 I want to unpack that thought for you a little bit today

133
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,480
 by taking you to one of my favorite Psalms.

134
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
 It's Psalm 40.

135
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,240
 And the whole Psalm is incredible.

136
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
 We don't have time today to go through the whole Psalm.

137
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,360
 But I would encourage you, if this is a helpful message to you

138
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,840
 at the end of the service that you go away at some point today

139
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,360
 and read through the whole Psalm

140
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,520
 because it all speaks on the topic I'm looking at today.

141
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,480
 But I want to focus just on the first three verses.

142
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,440
 And I want to show you the Psalm is attributed to David.

143
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,080
 We don't know whether specifically David wrote it or not.

144
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,160
 But I'm going to assume that he did for the purposes of the message today.

145
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,920
 And I want to read you the first three verses

146
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,600
 where David is explaining something truly profound that's happened to him.

147
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,440
 Starting in verse 1.

148
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,760
 It says, "I waited patiently for the Lord, and He turned to me and heard my cry.

149
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,760
 He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and the mire,

150
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,800
 and He set my feet on a rock, and He gave me a firm place to stand.

151
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,200
 He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.

152
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,360
 Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."

153
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,080
 I love what David does here.

154
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,360
 In the first two verses, he actually gives a personal testimony.

155
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,040
 He's writing a poem here, which was going to be turned into a song,

156
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,680
 which would be sung by Israel as a whole.

157
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,440
 And in that, he starts the first two verses with this personal testimony.

158
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,040
 He says, basically, there was a time in my life where things were difficult,

159
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,000
 where things were hard.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,400
 He describes it beautifully and poetically as a slimy, miry pit.

161
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,000
 He said, "I was waiting in that time patiently for the Lord to come."

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 I realized that there was nothing that I could do to drag myself out of this pit.

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,200
 The reason why I think he describes it as a slimy pit

164
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,360
 is every time he tried to get himself out of it, he just slipped and stayed in it.

165
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,480
 And so he's not able to find a foothold in this kind of thing,

166
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,040
 this situation in his life that was happening.

167
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,560
 And he says, "I'm waiting patiently for the Lord to come and do something that only He can do."

168
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,040
 Yesterday, over our three services, sorry, last week over our three services,

169
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,960
 I probably prayed for like 50 or so individual people here at the Vine.

170
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,080
 It was such a beautiful time.

171
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,040
 And everybody that came forward, I think they would echo what David is saying here.

172
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
 They would say that, "Hey, I'm in a tough situation.

173
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
 There's something going on in my life, and I've tried to fix it,

174
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
 and I've tried to do it, and it's not worked out.

175
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,320
 And I just seem to find myself still stuck in this place, but I'm hopeful.

176
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,080
 I'm waiting.

177
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,480
 I'm expecting that the Lord will come."

178
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,840
 And so many of you last week expressed that desire,

179
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,200
 that there's still hope even when circumstances are challenging.

180
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,080
 And so David expresses this hope, "I'm waiting patiently in the miry place."

181
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,520
 And then he gives his testimony.

182
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,120
 He says, "Then God turned to me and He lifted me out."

183
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,840
 I love what he said.

184
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,040
 He said, "I'm slipping and sliding when I'm trying to do it myself.

185
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,680
 He lifts me up and He puts me on a rock.

186
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,840
 He puts me on a solid ground.

187
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,040
 Only He could do that.

188
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,320
 It's for His glory.

189
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,000
 It's a beautiful thing."

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,040
 So his testimony is that God did come and meet him in his challenging situation

191
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
 and brought him into a new situation.

192
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
 But that's not all that he's saying.

193
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,840
 See, the beauty of these verses as they then flow into verse 3

194
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,480
 is that David wants you to know that there's not just a circumstantial change for him.

195
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,920
 He wants you to know that there has been an internal change for him.

196
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,960
 He's like, "When God comes and does something like that dramatically in our lives,

197
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,200
 changes our situation and circumstances,

198
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,840
 and puts us in a place where we're solidly safe and we can flourish from that point,

199
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,320
 is always a change that happens inside of me."

200
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,040
 David's like, "It's not just a circumstance change.

201
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
 It's a personal change."

202
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,280
 And he begins to testify to the reality of that personal change in verse 3.

203
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,680
 And this is the verse that I want us to really focus on.

204
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,000
 We're going to unpack this in some detail.

205
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,960
 Let me read it again.

206
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,720
 He said, "He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.

207
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,160
 Many will see and fear and put their trust in him."

208
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,560
 He starts by saying, "He put a new song."

209
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,800
 We're talking about a new season here at the Vine.

210
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,720
 Here's David standing for his people.

211
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,080
 And he said, "God put this new song in me."

212
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,840
 This is beautiful because David's trying to tell them

213
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,120
 that there is something that has happened in him that had never happened before.

214
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,360
 It's interesting, in the New Testament, which is written in Greek,

215
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,400
 there are two Greek words for the word "new."

216
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,920
 There's "neos," which means something new from a thing that was old.

217
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,800
 So taking an old thing and making it newer.

218
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,560
 And then there's the word "kynos," which we also translate as "new" in the New Testament.

219
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,320
 But that means something new from something that never existed before.

220
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,000
 Completely brand new.

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,280
 Now, the Old Testament is written in Hebrew.

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,320
 So that's not the word that's being used here.

223
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,960
 But interestingly, when the Old Testament was translated into Greek in Alexandria

224
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,880
 for the Greco-Roman Empire that were beginning to understand the Scriptures,

225
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,240
 the Greek version of the Old Testament, which is known as the LXX,

226
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,440
 the Greek version uses the word "kynos" here to describe what David's saying.

227
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,720
 In other words, he's saying, "This is not a new thing God is doing me

228
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,520
 in the sense that there are some old things that God has taken

229
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,880
 and blown the dust off and polished them up and tried to make them new."

230
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,720
 He's saying, "No, you've got to understand that when God does something in our lives,

231
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,800
 it's like there's this new thing that happens.

232
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,640
 It had never happened before.

233
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,280
 It is completely, utterly brand new.

234
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,880
 And it has totally transformed and revolutionized my life."

235
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,720
 And he wants the people to know that when God moves,

236
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,760
 so oftentimes it's not just that blowing off the dust and trying to make old things better.

237
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,480
 It's a completely new revolution.

238
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,120
 He's like, "That's the thing that's happened."

239
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
 Now, I want you to see what he says.

240
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,040
 He says, this is important, he says, "He put this new song in me."

241
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,760
 He emphasizes that God has placed it.

242
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,640
 He doesn't say, "I found a new song in me.

243
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,320
 Oh, I was tired.

244
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,160
 I was desperate, but I looked within myself and I found a new song."

245
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,680
 He doesn't say, "I earned the new song, that I created the new song,

246
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,720
 that I did the new song, that I deserved the new song."

247
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,080
 No, he's very specific.

248
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,000
 He says, "God put in me the new song.

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
 It's his work.

250
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,200
 It's his activity.

251
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,320
 I didn't earn it.

252
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,520
 I didn't deserve it.

253
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,480
 I didn't create it.

254
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,640
 No, he placed it in me.

255
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,600
 The very new thing he did, it was from him."

256
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,920
 Now, this is really important because here's what I think what happens so often in the church

257
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,680
 when God does a new thing.

258
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,800
 So often it's easy in a church context when God does a new thing for us to begin to think

259
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,040
 it's the result of some of the things we've done.

260
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,680
 "Oh, God's moving in a new way.

261
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
 It's because we prayed long and hard.

262
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
 Oh, it's because we did this.

263
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,480
 Oh, it's because we did that.

264
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,400
 Oh, isn't it great that God's doing a new thing?

265
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,040
 It must mean that we're in right standing with God.

266
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
 It must mean that we've done all these right things.

267
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
 It must mean that our worship is right and our prayers are right."

268
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,000
 And we begin to actually look to ourselves as the reason why God has done a new thing.

269
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,600
 And David wants to stand before his people and say, "No, no, no.

270
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,960
 I didn't do anything.

271
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,680
 Oh, sure.

272
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,920
 I was waiting patiently for him.

273
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,520
 I held onto hope.

274
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,960
 Sure, I postured myself in the right way, but it was purely a sovereign act of God that

275
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,680
 he lifted me out of that pit, put me on the solid ground.

276
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,320
 He then changed something within me.

277
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,040
 He worked by his spirit in me, not because I'd earned it or done something special, but

278
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,680
 just simply because he is sovereign and glorious and good and filled with love.

279
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
 He put it in me."

280
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,440
 And the problem is when we look at the good new thing that's happening and begin to think

281
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,400
 that actually it might be down to us, here's what happens.

282
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,640
 We don't start to think worship.

283
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,240
 We start to think worth it.

284
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,920
 Come on, church.

285
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,960
 We don't think worship like, "Oh, wow.

286
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,080
 Isn't he amazing?"

287
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,280
 We begin to think, "Oh, we're beginning to do some right things at church now.

288
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,520
 We're beginning to get it all right."

289
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,160
 And we begin to quash the new thing that is happening because we've essentially highlighted

290
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,880
 idolatry.

291
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,000
 We've made it about ourselves.

292
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,200
 One of the things I loved about last week, I remember when I got up last week at the

293
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,400
 11 and we had that time of silence for those of you here.

294
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,240
 At that time, I had no idea what was going to happen next.

295
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,320
 I didn't know if I was going to preach or not.

296
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,280
 I didn't know anything.

297
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,920
 I literally just stood up there and was like, "Let's just shut up and listen."

298
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,120
 And God did what he wanted to do.

299
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,360
 He put a new song in our mouths.

300
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,720
 Are you with me?

301
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,640
 Here's the thing you have to understand.

302
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,400
 It is not our song.

303
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,960
 It is his.

304
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,880
 And when we actually place ourselves in the realization that it is not our song, it is

305
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,840
 his, that puts us in a place of worship.

306
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,640
 That puts us in a humility place, in a place where we recognize that it is God at work

307
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,440
 and not us.

308
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,360
 It is his song, not our own.

309
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,600
 He put it inside of us and we respond in that.

310
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,800
 One of the things that I think is so good, and I really want to honor Emmer and Jethro.

311
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,840
 They work incredibly hard, them and the worship pastors and the worship leaders and the volunteers

312
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,720
 in our worship team.

313
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,200
 They give so many hours and not just what you see on a Sunday.

314
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,280
 There is a lot of work and prayer and everything that goes behind the scenes to be able to

315
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,440
 do what they do for you, for us on a Sunday.

316
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,560
 And one of the things that I know from a platform ministry myself is that the platform is a

317
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,000
 very seductive place.

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,720
 The platform is a place where egos come in and where it is easy to begin to think that,

319
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,400
 "Oh, because I have done something, God has responded."

320
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,320
 And one of the things that I really honor in Emmer and Jethro, why I think they are

321
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,800
 such gifts to us, is that I see them off the platform, not just on the platform.

322
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,120
 And I know that these are two people in the wider team and the culture that they're instilling

323
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,200
 in the wider team is one where they're basically saying, "It's not our song, it's His."

324
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
 It's not about us, it's about Him.

325
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,560
 And the most that we can get out of ourselves and allow Him to be who He is, then the more

326
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,080
 glorified He will be.

327
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,160
 And I think one of the reasons why we are able to glorify Christ is because they are

328
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,200
 doing their very best to not glorify themselves.

329
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,720
 And I honor that.

330
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,600
 Can we give them a round of applause?

331
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,560
 Because I just really honor that.

332
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:36,160
 You need to understand that your worship is always going to be the most authentically

333
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,400
 glorifying when you constantly remind yourself that it is His song and not your own.

334
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,720
 That is the way that we bring Christ the greatest amount of glory.

335
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
 Now, notice what he says now.

336
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,640
 Is this helping people?

337
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,240
 Notice what he says next.

338
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,740
 I love this.

339
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,280
 He says, "Now, He's put this new song in my mouth."

340
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,160
 Now, I want you to first of all see, he says, "in my mouth."

341
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,120
 He doesn't stand before Israel and say, "Come on, Israel, He's put a new song in our mouths."

342
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,840
 And there's power in corporate worship.

343
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,400
 But David wants to be really clear that what God has done, the testimony that He's just

344
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,560
 given, and the fact that He said, "God and His sovereignty has done it in me and has

345
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,000
 changed something within me."

346
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,320
 He's saying, "It's now in my mouth."

347
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,520
 In other words, this is a personal thing that has happened.

348
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,080
 It is something that has truly impacted and changed me.

349
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,640
 And it's in my mouth, which means I have a responsibility with what I do with it.

350
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
 This is so important.

351
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
 He's not saying, "Hey, it's in our mouths.

352
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,240
 And hey, if you guys do something, then cool, because I don't need to."

353
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,640
 He's saying, "No, no, there's a responsibility on me because of what the gospel, what God

354
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,200
 has done in my life, it is in my mouth.

355
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,920
 And the question is, what am I going to do with it?"

356
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,240
 And if you're thinking about how you might be able to live the gospel more actively and

357
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,800
 more publicly in your life ahead, here's a question to ask yourself.

358
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,440
 What is the song that God has put into your mouth for you to sing?

359
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,000
 It'll look different for each one of us, because the way that the Holy Spirit works within

360
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,520
 each one of us is different.

361
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,000
 There's a different testimony, a different sense of His working, a different thing that

362
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,600
 He's doing in our lives.

363
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,440
 And as we begin to wrestle with what it is that Christ has done uniquely in us, that

364
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,040
 becomes the song we can sing.

365
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:28,320
 And there's something profound that happens when somebody gives a personal testimony to

366
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,280
 the way that God is.

367
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,200
 And I want you to hear this.

368
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,880
 This is equally as important.

369
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,080
 Somebody else's song is not your new song to sing.

370
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,600
 Come on, church.

371
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
 Somebody else's song is not your new song to sing.

372
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,440
 That doesn't mean that we can't be moved into worship because somebody else's testimony.

373
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,720
 No, of course we can.

374
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,800
 In fact, last week in our service here at The Eleven, we had somebody testify before

375
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,120
 the start of our worship time, and we all responded in worship because of their testimony.

376
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,880
 So yes, we do move into worship off of the testimony of someone else.

377
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
 But here's what David's trying to communicate.

378
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,720
 He's like, God has done something uniquely for you, uniquely in you.

379
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,560
 And the new song, the new thing that is coming up out of you is not the manner of somebody

380
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,240
 else, it's got to be your manner.

381
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,120
 It's got to be the thing that is placed inside of you.

382
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,640
 And as you bring glory and recognition to God for what he's done in you, it's your

383
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,000
 song, which is crazy because he's just said, God has put it, it's God's song, not mine,

384
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
 but he's done it in me.

385
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,600
 So I must proclaim.

386
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,920
 I must own it.

387
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,200
 I must have that responsibility to speak it out.

388
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,800
 And somebody else's song is not your new song to sing.

389
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:46,080
 If you try to be like somebody else in the kingdom, you will always fail to authentically

390
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,040
 worship God.

391
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
 Say that again.

392
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,040
 You try to be somebody else in the kingdom and live somebody else's life and live their

393
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
 testimony and live their praise.

394
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,400
 You will never live the most authentic version of who you are because you were created to

395
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,960
 praise.

396
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,040
 Now, notice he says here, he says, he has put this in my mouth.

397
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,800
 I love this.

398
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
 Notice what he doesn't say.

399
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,000
 He doesn't say he's put this in my heart, which kind of theologically actually probably

400
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,040
 makes more sense.

401
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,920
 Like maybe David should have said, hey, you know, he's done this amazing thing.

402
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,720
 He's changed this thing.

403
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,920
 He's done this stuff within me.

404
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,680
 He's put a new song in my heart.

405
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,640
 He doesn't say heart here.

406
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,520
 He says mouth.

407
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
 And I think he's doing that on purpose.

408
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,760
 If he had said he's put a new song in my heart, what he's basically saying is he's done something

409
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,720
 private for me.

410
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,240
 He's done something that has changed me within.

411
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,400
 He's done something that is a private experience that I'm so grateful for.

412
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,760
 This is a little bit like Mary when Mary encounters the activity of God as she becomes pregnant

413
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,280
 with Christ through the Holy Spirit.

414
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,160
 The Bible says that she hides these things in her heart.

415
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,320
 It was an important thing that happened for her personally, but it was a private thing

416
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,080
 that she wrestled with in her heart.

417
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,240
 David doesn't want Israel to think that way.

418
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,960
 So he says he's put this new song in my mouth because he's wanting to shift his people from

419
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,200
 a private thinking in their faith to a public thinking in their faith.

420
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,000
 Because when a song is in your mouth, it's for you to proclaim.

421
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,440
 When it's in your heart, it might be something for you to wrestle with and hold in your heart.

422
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,720
 When it's in your mouth, the specific emphasis is that this is something that happened in

423
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,480
 the private that needs to be made public.

424
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,880
 Oh, he's put a new song, something I've never done, something only he could do.

425
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,480
 He's placed it within me, but it's in my mouth because he wants me to testify, to release,

426
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,680
 to proclaim the beauty of what he's done.

427
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:50,960
 The reality is, though, I think so often in the church and so often I can even say personally

428
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,640
 in my own life, we get so comfortable in the privacy of our faith that we lose the muscle

429
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,560
 memories of our mouths.

430
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:11,840
 And we lose the ability to truly proclaim the gospel as we've been called to do.

431
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,520
 And we just make the gospel a private thing that happens behind four walls and a closed

432
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,360
 door and has nothing to do.

433
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,120
 And then like black knights, we slip out into the world hoping that no one sees Jesus in

434
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,680
 us.

435
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:33,440
 David's saying it's in my mouth for a very important reason.

436
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,320
 And if we think about why is it that we so often hold it in our hearts and not proclaim

437
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,560
 it in our mouths, not live it out in the way we should, I think there are some good reasons.

438
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,240
 Sometimes there's fear.

439
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,280
 And trust me, sharing your faith publicly, sharing your faith more actively, is a good

440
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,840
 thing.

441
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,720
 Sharing it more actively with your colleagues and with your family, it's not an easy thing.

442
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,000
 It is a fearful thing.

443
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,600
 It can be kind of scary.

444
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,120
 We wonder how they'll respond.

445
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,640
 We wonder how they will react.

446
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
 I understand that.

447
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,800
 But I think oftentimes we don't actually use our mouths or we proclaim ourselves the glory

448
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,320
 of what God's done in us because we've seen other people do it so badly.

449
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,000
 And because they've done it so badly, we don't want to be associated with it.

450
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
 We've seen people smack people over the head with a Bible and we're like, "We want to

451
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,680
 do it as possible."

452
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,640
 We've seen people take a loud hailer and scream at people in the streets and we're like, "We

453
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,200
 don't want to be associated with that kind of Christianity."

454
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
 And here's what happens.

455
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,280
 Because we're so trying to push away from the poor examples of what it is to share our

456
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,760
 faith, we end up not sharing our faith at all.

457
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,160
 And we begin to lose the muscle memory of what actually God has put in our mouths.

458
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,440
 And I think what David's trying to say here is, "Look, just because some people have done

459
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,480
 it in a bad way doesn't mean you have to do it in a bad way."

460
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,760
 Just because some people have made the name of Christ bad doesn't mean Christ's name is

461
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,080
 bad.

462
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,040
 And that maybe there's something that the Holy Spirit is calling us into to say, "Oh,

463
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,200
 he's put this song in my mouth because there's something I need to do to proclaim it in some

464
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,440
 public way so that change might happen."

465
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,840
 Notice what it is that we proclaim.

466
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,080
 He says this, "A hymn of praise to our God."

467
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,200
 The Hebrew concept of a hymn of praise here is the famous word, "Hallelujah," that we

468
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,480
 hear so much about in our modern context as well.

469
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,720
 "Hallelujah" is this beautiful Hebrew concept.

470
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,960
 It's a word and a concept that comes around it that literally means "Praise God."

471
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,760
 And when we think about "Hallelujah," oftentimes in our modern context, and even, I think,

472
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,720
 a lot of times when it's used in modern worship context, the translation we have in our mind

473
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,400
 is that "Hallelujah" is about like a, "Praise God, you're awesome!"

474
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,920
 We think it's almost like a worship prompt.

475
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,680
 Like, "Hallelujah" is like a, "Praise God, God, you're awesome."

476
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,880
 Well, it's not actually emphasizing that kind of praise.

477
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,720
 The word "Hallelujah" in its Hebrew is a command, not a exhaustation.

478
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,120
 In other words, it's not, "Praise God!"

479
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,240
 It's, "Praise God."

480
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,640
 I'm serious.

481
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,240
 In the Hebrew context, it's not, "Praise God, he's amazing!"

482
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,680
 "Praise God, he's amazing!"

483
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,440
 It's, "Get off your butt and praise God."

484
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,640
 Like, "Get up and be active and praise God."

485
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,920
 Like, you can't just stay there and pretend you're a Christian and not give him public praise.

486
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,680
 Like, you need to bring a "Hallelujah" to this world.

487
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,160
 You need to say to the people around you, "What are you doing?"

488
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,440
 To live out the gospel in creative and amazing ways.

489
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,040
 You should be praising God.

490
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,760
 "Hallelujah" is a call to Israel.

491
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,680
 Every single time you see it in the Old Testament, it's a call to Israel

492
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,520
 to not hide their faith.

493
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,760
 It's saying to Israel, "Get up and praise God."

494
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,120
 "Get up and testify about what God has done."

495
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,240
 "Get up and use your mouths and your lives to begin to model something to the world

496
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,960
 of the character and the nature and the grace of God."

497
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,760
 "Hallelujah!"

498
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,160
 He's put a song of praise in my mouth.

499
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,680
 It is a hymn of praise.

500
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,960
 It is a "Hallelujah!"

501
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
 And therefore, it is not just a proclamation.

502
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,600
 It is also an invitation.

503
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,840
 It's not just a, "You're great!"

504
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,240
 It's, "He's great. Here's why."

505
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,320
 And you can know a God who's great.

506
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,400
 I want you to also praise Him.

507
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,240
 So in order for you to praise Him, let me share with you what He's done in my life.

508
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,120
 It's a proclamation and an invitation.

509
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,680
 He has put a new song in my mouth, and it is a "Hallelujah!"

510
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,080
 It's beautiful, isn't it?

511
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,520
 Now, notice then what He says, and this is how He finishes.

512
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,000
 I love this.

513
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,840
 He says, "Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."

514
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,320
 Now, this is kind of interesting.

515
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,480
 Follow the logic of David here.

516
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,520
 He's talking about a song, a new song that God has placed in his mouth.

517
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,240
 He's described it as a hymn of praise.

518
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,560
 He said that, "I am going to proclaim it publicly."

519
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,320
 And then He says, "All will hear the song and come to know the Lord."

520
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,840
 That's not what He says.

521
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,720
 Now, that would be the logical thing to say.

522
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,120
 I'm talking about some thing that I'm going to project with my mouth and sing a new song.

523
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,920
 So all who hear.

524
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,640
 He doesn't say that.

525
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,400
 He says, "All will see and fear and know the Lord."

526
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,000
 And I think David's being so prophetically brilliant here.

527
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,400
 Because what he's saying, he's already said so far in this verse, "We are to proclaim."

528
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,800
 But then he's also saying, "If all you ever do is say something,

529
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,760
 then that's never really the fullness of the power of what God's doing."

530
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,840
 You need to make sure your life, how you act, the way you are,

531
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
 marries to what it is that you say.

532
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,120
 Because if all you're doing is proclaiming the love of Christ,

533
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,520
 and you're not loving your enemies, you're nothing.

534
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,360
 You're just a resounding gong and a clanging cymbal.

535
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,800
 If all you're doing is saying, "Hey, I can speak with the tongue of men and angels,

536
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,840
 and everything's going to be great."

537
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,200
 But you're not actually giving your life up and picking up your cross

538
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,280
 and taking Jesus seriously.

539
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,440
 Then he's basically saying, "You're not saying anything."

540
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,880
 You've got to live in such a way that people see the new song.

541
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,680
 Not just hear the new song.

542
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,360
 Not just hear some words that some pastor says,

543
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,400
 or hear some worship that some church does in closed doors for 90 minutes on a Sunday.

544
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,440
 But actually when they're in the boardroom, when they're in the restaurants,

545
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,000
 when they're on the streets, when they're living in the apartment,

546
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 people say, "That person is different.

547
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,120
 There's something in this one who is living a life that is different

548
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,640
 from how I'm living my life.

549
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,320
 Why do they seem to be so at peace when the economy is crashing?

550
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,720
 Why do they seem to think Hong Kong has hope

551
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,560
 when I don't think Hong Kong has hope?

552
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,680
 Why do they think that they are this and that and that

553
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,120
 when I know that this and this..."

554
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,200
 And people begin to wrestle with the reality.

555
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,000
 Not because they hear something, because they see something.

556
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,080
 And sure, the proclamation of the gospel has to come with words.

557
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,640
 Scripture told us that it comes with the words

558
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,800
 that we must preach the gospel and the words.

559
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,560
 But here, David marries that picture just like James does

560
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,040
 as James writes his letter later in the New Testament.

561
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,400
 He marries the proclamation with the lifestyle

562
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:27,680
 so that many would see the new song and fear the Lord and put their trust in him.

563
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,600
 See, when a church lives out publicly the redemption

564
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
 that Christ has done within them privately,

565
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,080
 when it shows the love of Jesus and not just speaks of it,

566
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,080
 when it lays its own life down and doesn't just tell about a God

567
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,520
 who has laid his life down,

568
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,120
 then all will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.

569
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,320
 This is the why, people.

570
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,360
 This is the why of the church.

571
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:02,160
 People, this is the why of why God is calling us in 2025 to a year of action

572
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,240
 because 92% of the people in Hong Kong do not know Jesus.

573
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,160
 92% of the people in the city do not know Jesus.

574
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,560
 But he has put a new song in my mouth,

575
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:20,560
 a song of praise and declaration and invitation.

576
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,680
 And if I keep my mouth shut,

577
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,480
 if I don't live in the way that he's called me to live,

578
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,160
 if I don't take the principles of his love and begin to love my neighbor,

579
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,160
 love my enemy, love the broken,

580
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,920
 if I'm not doing that, then I'm just a resounding gong, a clanging cymbal,

581
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,640
 and I could just show up on a Sunday and raise my hands,

582
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,800
 but nothing is changing out there.

583
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,960
 And God would say, "I'm lighting up something in the new season

584
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,400
 that I'm doing here at the Vine,

585
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,120
 and it's going to be uncomfortable, it's going to be messy,

586
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,400
 it's going to be difficult,

587
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,080
 and I'm going to talk more about that in two weeks.

588
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,200
 Look forward to that.

589
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,480
 It's going to be uncomfortable."

590
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,800
 But that's why Jesus went to the cross,

591
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,720
 not so the church would be a holy huddle,

592
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,040
 but so that we would, with grace and love and beauty and wonder

593
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,600
 and creativity and amazement,

594
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,400
 share what it is that God has done in us.

595
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,160
 I was in a slimy pit,

596
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,880
 but now my feet are on solid ground,

597
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,440
 and how can I not say and live

598
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,880
 so that people could hear and see the beauty of the Lord?

599
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,800
 Can they see the new song?

600
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:39,520
 If the Vine is going to live out more courageously in a year of action,

601
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,880
 we have to ask ourselves,

602
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,360
 are they seeing the new song as much as they're hearing the new song?

603
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,000
 Because, listen to this, church,

604
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,440
 everything that happens in here is not for in here.

605
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
 It is for out there.

606
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,280
 That's why the church exists.

607
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,740
 Amen?

608
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,480
 Can I pray for us?

609
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,540
 Let's pray.

610
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,720
 Actually, maybe you could stand as I pray.

611
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,760
 I just feel led to invite you to stand,

612
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,640
 because we're standing before a God

613
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,240
 who has placed the gospel inside of us.

614
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,680
 If you're a Christian in this room,

615
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,200
 online, in the overflow,

616
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,200
 you're someone who's a knight,

617
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,040
 a child of God,

618
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,280
 riding out under the royal banners.

619
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,040
 And while we want to be sensible with how we share the gospel,

620
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,200
 and we've seen the ugly ways that it's happened,

621
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,520
 and we don't want to repeat past mistakes,

622
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,320
 but equally, we recognize that so often we've held it so much within us

623
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,160
 that we've actually not become effective at all.

624
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,640
 And that when people find out we're a Christian,

625
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,520
 they're like, "Really?"

626
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,400
 Rather than saying, "I knew there was something about you."

627
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,480
 Father, you haven't asked us to be weird.

628
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,480
 You haven't asked us to escape to a monastery on a hill.

629
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,760
 Jesus's prayer was that they would be in the world, but not of it.

630
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,560
 That we would live like yeast in dough.

631
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,560
 That we would be different, but different in the places,

632
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,000
 of the workplaces, and the boardrooms, and the educational spheres,

633
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,160
 and all the other things that are represented here.

634
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,800
 That we would live right in the midst of it all,

635
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,480
 but we would be yeast and not dough.

636
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,880
 And that we would declare with our mouths and with our lives

637
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,640
 the glory of the gospel.

638
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,920
 For the lost, and the hurting, and the broken of our city,

639
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,840
 that's what the vine needs to stand for.

640
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:39,200
 And Father, I want to pray

641
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,160
 that you would give this group of people courage.

642
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,800
 Remember, it is His song, but it's in your mouth.

643
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,360
 There is a unique way for you to express the gospel in your life.

644
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,400
 And it will look different for each one of us.

645
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,560
 Make your prayer this year, "Lord, show me how I can more authentically

646
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,800
 live out the testimony of what you've done in my life to those around me."

647
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,120
 And you're going to see some fruit, and you're not going to see some fruit.

648
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,200
 But let me lift this off you right now.

649
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,600
 The fruit is not your responsibility.

650
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,280
 You do not bring anyone into the kingdom of God.

651
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
 That's the work of the Holy Spirit.

652
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,560
 That's what Jesus does.

653
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,560
 What we do is recognize that there is a song that's been placed in our mouths.

654
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,960
 A hymn of praise to the glory of God.

655
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,480
 And that through that, many will see, and fear, and trust.

656
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,760
 In the Lord.

657
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,080
 I want to invite you just to take some time.

658
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,960
 Just take some time to receive what the Holy Spirit has for you this morning.

659
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,040
 For you, for some of you, it's courage and boldness.

660
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,000
 And you want to ask for that.

661
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,160
 For some of you, this whole idea freaks you out a lot, and that's understandable.

662
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,760
 And you're like, "I don't even know.

663
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,640
 I'm an introvert, man.

664
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,360
 I just want to run away.

665
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,480
 I don't even know what."

666
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,640
 Like, that's for people like Pastor Andrew and other people that seem excited about it.

667
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,000
 I'm not excited about it.

668
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,880
 That's okay.

669
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,000
 If that's your starting point here today, that's absolutely fine.

670
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,600
 I want to speak to those that perhaps feel like this is for somebody else and not for you.

671
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,640
 I want to just share this.

672
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,680
 That, remember, somebody else's song is not your new song to sing.

673
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,960
 And that there is a place for every single personality, every single person, every single

674
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,600
 culture.

675
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,320
 There is a unique expression of the gospel that sits within you.

676
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,040
 And you are to express it in the unique way that is right for you.

677
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,440
 Just don't keep your mouth shut.

678
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,560
 Lord, loosen our mouths.

679
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,920
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

680
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,080
 Everyone says.
