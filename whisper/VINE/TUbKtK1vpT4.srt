1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 Yes, it is so good to see you.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,560
 Last night was a good night.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,400
 Does anyone know why?

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,000
 Because Germany won 2-0 on the Euros.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
 Now, of course, I couldn't stay up.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,720
 I'm preaching today, but I'm excited.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,480
 Well, for my senior year,

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,440
 I moved from Germany to the US and I lived with

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,320
 a host family that were raisin farmers.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,280
 Now, of course, you don't grow raisins, you grow grapes.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,680
 So I lived on actually in

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,680
 the middle of a vineyard for my senior year of high school.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,280
 Now, if you know anything about farming communities,

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
 farming people, they work incredibly hard.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,800
 They're hardworking people.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,040
 Now, I was 17 years old,

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,200
 little self-focused, absorbed with myself at that time.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,000
 I didn't always know how to pick up after myself.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,600
 I also came from a different family,

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,080
 different families do things differently.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,160
 I wasn't always aware of how I could be helpful.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,160
 Now, don't get me wrong.

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,200
 I helped out in the house,

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,680
 I helped out in the yard,

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,120
 I helped out on the farm,

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,400
 even got to drive a tractor every once in a while if they let me,

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,280
 got to drive a forklift.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,360
 Only was allowed to do that once.

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,440
 But looking back,

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,760
 I really often really missed those opportunities to be helpful

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,560
 and to pick up on how I could

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,880
 contribute to what was going on that family and on that farm.

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,240
 I'm so thankful for the host parents

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,120
 because they were so graceful and so patient with me.

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,280
 Here I am totally oblivious,

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,960
 maybe I put dishes in the dishwasher but never take them out,

37
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,040
 they magically appear in the cupboards,

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,680
 that type of thing.

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
 But they were patient with me,

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
 and of course they also told me how I could be helpful,

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,960
 they helped me with that.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,960
 But all of that made my senior year

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,640
 one of the highlights really of my life.

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,880
 It really was a turning point,

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,440
 an incredible year and it was because of their

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,160
 just love and patience that they showed me.

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,720
 Now, I did not deserve this patience,

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,000
 but all of this makes me think about,

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,400
 isn't it interesting how often we run out of patience,

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,360
 how often there's so little patience in our lives.

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,640
 Sometimes people don't have patience with us,

52
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,680
 we need a lot of grace and a lot of patience,

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,760
 but then other times we lack

54
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,360
 or we run out of patience and grace for other people.

55
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,880
 Now I want to share some examples,

56
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,480
 and I'm curious to see if you resonate with them.

57
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,960
 The first one is walking.

58
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,280
 When I walk and somebody is slow in front of me

59
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,920
 and I need to get somewhere, I get impatient.

60
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
 Anyone with me on that?

61
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,240
 Few people, okay.

62
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,560
 So you have some power walkers here, good.

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,240
 There's other things that make me impatient.

64
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,920
 Maybe I hear I don't drive, but I drove in other countries,

65
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,720
 when people don't use their signals.

66
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,440
 It's like, "Hey, I can't read your mind

67
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,440
 that you are changing the lane, and I'm behind you,

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
 and you suddenly cut in front of me."

69
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,960
 So there was impatience with that.

70
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,120
 But if we're honest, there's also a lot of impatience

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,200
 and lack of grace in our friendships,

72
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,320
 and with family members, maybe with our parents,

73
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,480
 maybe with our brothers and sisters,

74
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,240
 maybe with our children.

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,000
 And there's also a lot of lack of patience

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,560
 when people hold different political views than we hold.

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,720
 Like, "Why don't they get it?

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,040
 Why can't they see this?"

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,360
 You know, like, "Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk."

80
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,000
 You know, "Forget that."

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,480
 And so there's a lot of lack of grace, but you know what?

82
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,200
 There's also lack of patience and grace

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,520
 a lot of times in the church.

84
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,040
 Now, I was thinking about this.

85
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,520
 I actually have this idea.

86
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,320
 It's called patient church.

87
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,080
 Now, for me, that's not what I always put together,

88
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,800
 but actually it should be put together,

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,760
 that the church is a place where there's patience

90
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,480
 and where there's grace for each other,

91
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,920
 where we give that, but also where we receive that.

92
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,640
 But often, often we lack that.

93
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,640
 Now, obviously, patience and grace is something

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,240
 that every Christian, that God wants to work into our lives.

95
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,640
 So I have a little statement here.

96
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,000
 Patience is one of God's characteristics

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,680
 that he wants to grow and bring about in our lives.

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,320
 Now, that's not always the most exciting thing.

99
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,640
 "Yay, we're gonna grow in patience.

100
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,400
 "We're gonna be able to put up with things."

101
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,920
 Is anyone excited with me?

102
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,240
 No, I don't really sense it.

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,800
 "Yay."

104
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,320
 I have a little daughter, so I go into the clapping mode.

105
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,880
 "Yay," you know?

106
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,880
 But really, God desires to bring that into our lives,

107
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,160
 to grow that into our lives.

108
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
 And the Bible talks about,

109
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,560
 actually the book that we're in, in the series,

110
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,320
 Galatians, talks about the fruit of the spirit.

111
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,240
 And one of them is patience.

112
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,560
 And God wants to bring about patience in our lives.

113
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,600
 He wants to see that unfold.

114
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,360
 And so we're continuing our sermon series

115
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,920
 through the book of Galatians.

116
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,040
 We're gonna see how Paul is just incredibly patient

117
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,160
 with the Galatians church that has gotten off track,

118
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,480
 that's not treating him very nicely.

119
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,160
 And then we're also, of course, gonna see

120
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,920
 how God wants to speak to us about being patient

121
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,560
 and being full of grace.

122
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,800
 So let's go to Galatians 4.

123
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
 We're starting in verse eight.

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,240
 It says this, "Formerly, when you did not know God,

125
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,040
 "you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.

126
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,520
 "But now that you know God, or rather are known by God,

127
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,960
 "how is it that you are turning back

128
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,120
 "to those weak and miserable forces?

129
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,040
 "Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?

130
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,400
 "You are observing special days and months

131
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,460
 "and seasons and years.

132
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,260
 "I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted

133
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,760
 "my efforts on you."

134
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,160
 So what's going on here?

135
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
 So Paul is saying,

136
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,480
 talking about a time when they didn't know God.

137
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,000
 That's basically when they were idol worshipers.

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,160
 Then there is a time where they've come to know God,

139
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,040
 where they have a personal relationship with him.

140
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,280
 But he's saying like now they're going back

141
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,240
 to basically this idol worship.

142
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,160
 He's like, "Why?

143
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,340
 "Why would you enslave yourself all over again?

144
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,020
 "Why in the world would you do that?"

145
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,680
 Now, this sounds like the Galatians are going back

146
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,760
 to the former way of life,

147
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,040
 like they're deconverting from their faith.

148
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,960
 But that's actually not what's going on.

149
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,320
 What they're doing is they're starting to observe

150
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,040
 the Mosaic Law.

151
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,960
 You know, there's these days and these months

152
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
 and these special years.

153
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,760
 And Paul is equating this religious observing

154
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,020
 and striving and paganism,

155
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,600
 where you're trying to manipulate God somehow

156
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,360
 to do something to give you favor.

157
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
 He's equating that or drawing an analogy

158
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,920
 between that and the Galatians starting

159
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,680
 to observe the Mosaic Law and trying to gain

160
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,480
 right relationship with God.

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,940
 He's like, "Why would you do that?

162
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,120
 "You already know God."

163
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,460
 So that's what's going on here.

164
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:49,480
 Now, Paul, one of the big things he's emphasizing here

165
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,720
 is this whole thing about knowing God.

166
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
 Not knowing, you know, you didn't know God.

167
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,560
 So actually let's pull that up.

168
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,600
 So it says there, "Formerly when you did not know God,"

169
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,040
 and then he talks about, "But now that you know God

170
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,840
 "or rather are known by God."

171
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,560
 So this is, whenever you see in the Bible

172
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,840
 something repeated, there's always something

173
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,700
 that God wants to especially highlight there.

174
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,700
 Now, knowing is not just intellectually knowing

175
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,120
 or knowing something about someone.

176
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,800
 It's actually also experientially knowing.

177
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,320
 And so Paul is saying when he said that they know God,

178
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,600
 that when they became a Christian,

179
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,440
 they started to experientially experience

180
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,440
 the Father God in their lives,

181
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,160
 that they actually experienced this relationship,

182
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,660
 experienced Him to be real.

183
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,760
 And he's taking them back to that experience

184
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,860
 that they've had.

185
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,840
 And so that's why he's asking like,

186
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,800
 why would you wanna go back to anything else?

187
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,880
 You already have a relationship with God, the Father.

188
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,240
 But then what's interesting is

189
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,940
 he actually almost mid-sentence

190
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,000
 kind of corrects him or changes his direction

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
 instead of talking about you know God.

192
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,600
 He says, "Or rather are known by God."

193
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,320
 Now, what's the difference with that?

194
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,360
 Why does he make that shift?

195
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,700
 Well, I'm gonna try to explain this

196
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,160
 with a little bit of a silly analogy,

197
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,600
 and this is not a true story.

198
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,000
 So I'll just put that out there.

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,100
 I try to choose a person

200
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,240
 that I thought most people would be familiar with.

201
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,840
 The person's name is Taylor Swift.

202
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,040
 (audience laughing)

203
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,080
 All right, so okay, most people are nodding.

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,000
 Most people are familiar.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,720
 Okay, good, I chose the right person then.

206
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,720
 So let's say I tell you, I know Taylor Swift.

207
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,400
 I've met her once and I talked to her for 20 seconds.

208
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,000
 You're like, well, that's pretty cool.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,320
 You met her for 20 seconds.

210
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
 You know, some people would be excited about that,

211
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,720
 but it's really, it doesn't mean that much.

212
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,680
 It means something, but it doesn't mean that much.

213
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,680
 But what if Taylor Swift in an interview says,

214
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,040
 "I know Tim Brixel.

215
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,320
 "I know this guy.

216
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,440
 "You know, he's known to me."

217
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,060
 And that would be quite different, right,

218
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,240
 if I say, "She knows me," right?

219
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,320
 So what Paul is saying,

220
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,520
 actually what's a lot more important than us knowing God

221
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,480
 is that we are known by God, that he knows us.

222
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,080
 You are known by God, the creator of the universe

223
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,360
 who holds everything in his hands, who knows, he knows you.

224
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,200
 You are his beloved child.

225
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,460
 And again, Paul is trying to take the Galatians

226
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,000
 to reminding them of this incredible truth

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,080
 about their identity.

228
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,320
 They are known by God.

229
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,680
 They are children of God.

230
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,840
 He knows their name.

231
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,960
 He knows what's going on in their lives.

232
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,420
 He knows everything.

233
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,280
 That's amazing.

234
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,680
 That's incredible.

235
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,520
 And again, the question is,

236
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
 why would you go back to something else?

237
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,760
 Now, I have shared here before

238
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,480
 about going through a difficult personal relationship,

239
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,280
 and there was a break, and I'm not gonna go into details.

240
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,240
 If you are interested, you can listen

241
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,880
 to the Longing for Healing sermon series.

242
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,000
 But so I was abandoned, I was left,

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,120
 and I was living with somebody that was an acquaintance

244
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,840
 that later on became a friend,

245
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,280
 and this was the first time of me going back to church

246
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,480
 after all that happened.

247
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,780
 And so I step into this church.

248
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,400
 The pastor is, you know, I don't know anything about them.

249
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,980
 They don't know me, and he is preaching about Psalm 139,

250
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,960
 and then they sing a song by Tommy something.

251
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,120
 It's not something, it's Tommy Walker, there we go.

252
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,520
 And it's "He Knows My Name."

253
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,000
 So I wanna share with you some of the lyrics from that song.

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,600
 It's old school, I love it,

255
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,760
 but you should go listen to it.

256
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,800
 But, you know, it's my, or even earlier generation.

257
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,480
 It goes like this.

258
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,960
 "I have a maker, he formed my heart.

259
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,400
 "Before even time began, my life was in his hands.

260
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,920
 "He knows my name.

261
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,360
 "He knows my every thought.

262
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,360
 "He sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call.

263
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,980
 "I have a father, he calls me his own.

264
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,920
 "He'll never leave me no matter where I go."

265
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,600
 Now, as I was stepping into this church,

266
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,640
 I felt abandoned.

267
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,920
 I felt left.

268
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,480
 God was not, even though I went to church,

269
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,520
 you know, that he knows me was not on my radar.

270
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,700
 And so as we're singing a song,

271
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,440
 I'm just reminded of that God knows me.

272
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,240
 That I'm not alone, that he is with me.

273
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,880
 That I'm not abandoned, that he sees each tear

274
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,720
 that I was crying in that time.

275
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,160
 And that was so comforting.

276
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,520
 I'm already known by God.

277
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,900
 It's not about my life being perfect

278
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,640
 or my circumstances being good or bad.

279
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,800
 God knows me.

280
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,240
 That's incredible.

281
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,800
 And that brings so much comfort

282
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,400
 when we realize the truth about our identity.

283
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,940
 But we constantly or regularly forget that.

284
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,160
 We forget our identity.

285
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,480
 That's why Paul, as he's writing to the Galatians,

286
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,280
 he's like trying to take them back

287
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,840
 to this basic understanding.

288
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,640
 You are known by God.

289
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,720
 He knows you.

290
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,120
 He knows your name.

291
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,120
 He knows every tear that has been falling down your face.

292
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,640
 Every single one.

293
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,040
 He has not missed it.

294
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
 And he is with you.

295
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,960
 He is for you.

296
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,640
 He is not against you.

297
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,440
 'Cause he's trying to bring them back to this truth.

298
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,280
 You do not have to go back to somehow try

299
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,860
 to earn this relationship with God the Father.

300
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,680
 You already have it.

301
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,040
 He already has adopted you as his sons, as his daughters.

302
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,320
 He already loves you.

303
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,640
 He is already with you.

304
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,000
 And so Paul, it doesn't make any sense

305
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,040
 to go from not knowing God to knowing God

306
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,560
 to now pretending like we don't know him

307
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,520
 and trying to somehow gain right standing with him.

308
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,400
 These human efforts, this religiosity,

309
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,240
 it is always a dead end.

310
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,480
 It never delivers.

311
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,860
 You cannot save yourself.

312
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,340
 You cannot make yourself feel good.

313
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:59,400
 Only the power of God, his love, his care, his presence,

314
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,800
 this Holy Spirit inside of you

315
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,900
 can start bringing about this wholeness and restoration,

316
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,060
 give you salvation, make you part of his family.

317
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,720
 So that's why Paul is taking him back.

318
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,180
 And he's being so patient.

319
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,100
 He's actually been doing this all throughout the letter.

320
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,500
 And he pleads with the Galatians

321
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,420
 in all these different ways.

322
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,780
 And he is trying to win them back

323
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,300
 to the basic gospel message, the basic truth.

324
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,620
 So let's continue.

325
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,820
 (clears throat)

326
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,180
 In Galatians 4, verse 12, it says this.

327
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,420
 I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me.

328
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,340
 For I became like you.

329
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,180
 You did me no wrong.

330
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,580
 As you know, it was because of an illness

331
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,820
 that I first preached the gospel to you.

332
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,500
 Even though my illness was a trial to you,

333
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,180
 you did not treat me with contempt or scorn.

334
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,900
 Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God,

335
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,340
 as if I were Christ Jesus himself.

336
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,780
 Where then is your blessing for me now?

337
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,780
 I can testify that if you could have done so,

338
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,820
 you would have torn out your eye and given them to me.

339
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,300
 Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?

340
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,700
 So this is again a heart-to-heart moment.

341
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,340
 Actually, in the letter before, Paul is doing

342
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,300
 a bunch of theology and going back in the history of Israel.

343
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,060
 But here he's really getting to this heart-to-heart talk.

344
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,420
 He's reminding them of when they first met.

345
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,980
 It's like when two, actually, in the first service,

346
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,900
 Pastor Ivan was talking about how him and Michi

347
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,820
 first met and their relationship.

348
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,940
 He's like taking him back to that sweet moment

349
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,860
 of first meeting.

350
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,740
 And he was ill at the time.

351
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,860
 Scholars don't know what exactly was going on.

352
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,020
 Was it a sickness?

353
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,380
 Was he ill because he was persecuted, beaten,

354
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,220
 and was disfigured and someone needing recovering

355
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,060
 from all of that?

356
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,420
 We don't know.

357
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,180
 But he must have been in quite a horrible shape.

358
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,540
 And so they take him in and he preaches the gospel,

359
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,260
 being apparently extremely sick to them.

360
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,020
 They come to faith, they experience God the Father.

361
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:25,380
 And even though his illness is actually a trial,

362
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,780
 there is so much needing to care for him.

363
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,980
 It's really not convenient.

364
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,100
 But they treat him, because he preaches gospel message

365
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,340
 about Jesus, he's the messenger,

366
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,460
 but they treat him as if he was Jesus himself

367
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,860
 with so much love, 'cause they experienced

368
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,980
 just God's goodness in their lives.

369
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,100
 And that was absolutely incredible.

370
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,380
 But then in verse 15, Paul says, "But what happened?"

371
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,100
 Like we had this amazing experience.

372
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,340
 It was so powerful, you loved me.

373
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,580
 You were willing to tear out your eye.

374
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,060
 You would do anything for me.

375
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,220
 That's what that means, tearing out your eye,

376
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,340
 not literally tearing out your eye.

377
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,980
 You would do anything for me.

378
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,380
 But why are you treating me now as an enemy?

379
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,620
 What's going on here?

380
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,580
 Now it's tough when people suddenly that we loved,

381
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:33,860
 that we cared for, that we had a good relationship with,

382
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,740
 suddenly see us as their enemies,

383
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,740
 and suddenly don't have good feelings towards us.

384
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,100
 Now I don't know if you've experienced that.

385
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,260
 I think if you're older, you probably have.

386
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,100
 You know, we experience it at different degrees,

387
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,140
 but it happens.

388
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,380
 And Paul, he's remaining graceful and patient

389
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,820
 and leaning in, even though they're treating him

390
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,020
 as an enemy.

391
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,700
 You know, that's incredible.

392
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,580
 Like, I don't know about you,

393
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,060
 if somebody treats you like an enemy that,

394
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,380
 you know, maybe for a little bit,

395
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,020
 you're able to have some patience, have some grace,

396
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,940
 but then you run out of it.

397
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,660
 And you're like, I'm gonna cut my losses,

398
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,420
 you know, peace out, see you later.

399
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,860
 Like, I just can't deal with that anymore.

400
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,220
 But Paul keeps leaning in, he keeps showing grace,

401
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,260
 he keeps showing love.

402
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,860
 But Paul is also making the point,

403
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,020
 you know, I have not changed.

404
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,060
 I've remained the same.

405
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,860
 I've preached the same gospel I preached then

406
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,100
 that I'm preaching now, that I'm telling you now about.

407
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,020
 But your feelings towards me have changed

408
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,620
 because the Galatians are starting to buy

409
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,980
 into a different gospel.

410
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,940
 And so now their feelings towards Paul have been changing

411
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,220
 and they treat him as an enemy.

412
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,380
 And I mean, that is just tough.

413
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,380
 That's tough.

414
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,780
 He keeps fighting for them, even though they keep fighting him.

415
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,820
 I really like that line.

416
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,660
 I'll say it again.

417
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,500
 He keeps fighting for them,

418
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,300
 even though they keep fighting him.

419
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,100
 Just think about that.

420
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,700
 Somebody's fighting you,

421
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,620
 but then that, but you keep fighting for them,

422
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,580
 their well-being.

423
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,020
 It's amazing, right?

424
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,380
 Talking about grace, patience, love.

425
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,460
 So let's continue in Galatians verse 17.

426
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,380
 It says this, "Those people are zealous to win you over."

427
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,460
 So by those people, he's talking about agitators,

428
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,940
 a group of agitators, a rival missionaries

429
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,500
 that came in after Paul into the church

430
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,260
 that were saying, "Hey, this guy only taught you

431
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,620
 half the truth.

432
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,980
 You know, here's the other half."

433
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,020
 So it's about them.

434
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,460
 So those people are zealous to win you over,

435
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,340
 but for no good.

436
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,220
 What they want is to alienate you from us

437
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,020
 so that you may have zeal for them.

438
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,500
 It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good,

439
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,740
 and to be so always, not just when I'm with you.

440
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,740
 My dear children, for whom I'm again

441
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,740
 in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,

442
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,740
 how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone

443
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,020
 because I'm perplexed about you.

444
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,460
 So first, he's talking about the motives, really,

445
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,460
 of the agitators, the group of people that came in

446
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,940
 and that are stirring up things with the Galatians.

447
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,060
 And he's saying, "Hey, they're trying to separate us."

448
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,100
 And really what they want is for you to be zealous for them,

449
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,100
 for you to honor them, for you to put them on a pedestal.

450
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,940
 That's what they want.

451
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,260
 That's really what they're after.

452
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,780
 They're talking all spiritual,

453
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,420
 but that's really what matters to them.

454
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,060
 And what an incredible contrast it is

455
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,340
 that that's not what Paul is about.

456
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,380
 Paul, he truly cares about them.

457
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,300
 He is for them.

458
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,980
 And like I said, he's fighting for them,

459
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,660
 even though they're fighting him.

460
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,260
 And now he expresses his heart in verse 19.

461
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,380
 So let me read this again.

462
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,300
 It says, "My dear children,

463
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,100
 for whom I'm again in the pains of childbirth

464
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,780
 until Christ is formed in you."

465
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:24,660
 So Paul is concerned for the Galatians' maturity,

466
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,060
 their spiritual well-being.

467
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:32,060
 That's why he wants God's goodness to unfold in their lives.

468
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,620
 That's why he's not giving up on them.

469
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,140
 I'm gonna fight for them.

470
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,260
 I'm gonna fight for their well-being

471
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,860
 because God loves them.

472
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,700
 They're worth it.

473
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,180
 I wanna see the goodness of God unfold

474
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,460
 in this group of people's lives,

475
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,980
 even though they're treating me right now as an enemy.

476
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,980
 And he uses the metaphor of giving birth for a second time.

477
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,060
 Now, I've never given birth,

478
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,700
 but I know that this is painful.

479
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,620
 And then just imagine the ancient times

480
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,140
 without any of the anesthetics and epidurals

481
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,300
 and all of that, you know,

482
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,340
 and then doing it a second time.

483
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,660
 So Paul is saying this is taking like some extra effort,

484
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,940
 double effort, you know, to see Christ fully formed

485
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,620
 and then see the life of Jesus unfold in their lives.

486
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:24,500
 But that's his desire, so he doesn't give up on them.

487
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,260
 He doesn't treat them like a lost cause.

488
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,620
 But here's a question.

489
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,980
 How is Paul able to do that?

490
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,020
 How is Paul able to be patient and graceful

491
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,460
 with people who are treating him as an enemy

492
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,420
 and seeking their well-being?

493
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,820
 Yeah, how do you do that?

494
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:52,140
 How do you do that when somebody's hating on you?

495
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,740
 Well, Paul, he writes a letter to one of his people

496
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,900
 he was mentoring and also co-laborers, co-ministers,

497
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,900
 Timothy, 1 Timothy 2, 15 and 16 says this.

498
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,780
 "Here's a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.

499
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,300
 "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners

500
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,380
 "of whom I am the worst.

501
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,620
 "But for that very reason, I was shown mercy

502
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,340
 "so that in me, the worst of sinners,

503
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,340
 "Christ Jesus might display his immense patience

504
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,700
 "as an example for those who would believe in him

505
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,180
 "and receive eternal life."

506
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:40,340
 So Christ has shown Paul immense patience.

507
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,060
 That means a lot of patience.

508
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,060
 Now, earlier in the letter to the Galatians in chapter one,

509
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,860
 Paul talks about that he used to persecute the church.

510
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,060
 He proved Christians being murdered.

511
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,500
 Paul was approving of that.

512
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,860
 He even talks about an act that he was breathing

513
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,860
 murderous threats as he was trying to go

514
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,660
 after the Christians.

515
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,060
 And then Jesus meets him, he appears to him,

516
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,140
 there's a revelation on the road to Damascus.

517
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,780
 And then through this whole experience,

518
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,820
 Paul ends up becoming a Christian.

519
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:22,180
 But it's just by this sheer grace and mercy of God,

520
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,380
 he didn't deserve it.

521
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,500
 None of us ever deserve Jesus healing,

522
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,220
 saving work in our lives.

523
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:34,140
 But he's able to be patient and show grace

524
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,300
 because Jesus has been patient with him

525
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,140
 and has shown him grace.

526
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,540
 And he just lives out of this mercy and grace

527
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,660
 and out of his identity as someone who's loved,

528
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,860
 who is forgiven.

529
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,860
 So now he can turn around and as he relies

530
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,540
 on the Holy Spirit, start showing mercy and grace

531
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,420
 to other people, start fighting for people

532
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,780
 who are hating on him because he desires,

533
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,540
 just like God desired for his life,

534
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,460
 the good to unfold in his life,

535
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,540
 he now turns around and desires that goodness of God

536
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,540
 to unfold in somebody else's life.

537
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:14,020
 So what about us?

538
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,540
 Like Paul, Jesus has shown us grace and patience

539
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,820
 so we can become people who show grace

540
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,300
 and patience to others.

541
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,780
 You know, we also, if you're a Christian,

542
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,860
 if you're a Jesus follower, you also are known by God.

543
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,020
 He knows your name.

544
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,580
 He loves you.

545
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,060
 He is for you, not against you.

546
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,820
 He is unfolding good things in your life.

547
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,620
 And when we live in that identity as being known by God,

548
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:51,660
 you know, it frees us up to start loving and serving

549
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,060
 and caring and fighting and wrestling

550
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:00,980
 and doing whatever it takes to see the goodness of God

551
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,780
 unfold in other people's lives.

552
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:09,460
 Now, when I was a teenager, my parents,

553
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,580
 this is very fitting for today, made me go to youth group.

554
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,300
 So I was, my parents were Christians.

555
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,660
 I was not a Christian at the time.

556
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,100
 They're like, you have to go one year to youth group.

557
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,060
 And then after that, you can make up your mind.

558
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,340
 So one year, that's a long time,

559
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,540
 especially if you don't feel like going.

560
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,420
 So, but what I had no choice, so I went.

561
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,980
 And, you know, after some time,

562
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,980
 the youth pastor, he labeled me as a troublemaker.

563
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:48,220
 And he actually asked me not to come back to youth group.

564
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,980
 (audience laughing)

565
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,300
 Now, I didn't want to tell my parents.

566
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,780
 So I just kept coming, just kept coming back.

567
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,340
 But you know what made the difference for me?

568
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,700
 Was that why, you know, it was not just him,

569
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,180
 was other people that sort of had given up on me,

570
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,540
 that had cut me off, cut the cost, you know,

571
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,060
 I don't want to deal with him.

572
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,220
 But there was one guy named Wolfram, awesome German name.

573
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:24,140
 And he, you know, he started caring for me,

574
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,580
 hanging out with me, going bowling with me,

575
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,820
 my friends before youth group,

576
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,220
 there was like a bowling center right next to that church.

577
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,740
 And, but also starting to speak some truth into my life,

578
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,260
 you know, calling me out on some things that weren't good.

579
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,260
 But it was because of his love and his acceptance

580
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,980
 that after the year was up,

581
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,300
 I decided to continue going to youth group.

582
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,260
 And I know that God worked through this man

583
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,580
 because he, instead of seeing,

584
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,500
 running out of patience and not showing me grace,

585
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,260
 he saw what God wanted to do in my life,

586
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,660
 and he fought for me, he didn't give up on me

587
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,660
 when others had given up on me,

588
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,900
 so that the life of Christ could unfold in my life.

589
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,140
 Amen, that's right.

590
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,540
 (audience laughing)

591
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:18,540
 And I just wonder, where could we show grace and patience

592
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,300
 and make a big difference in someone else's life?

593
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:33,860
 Who is God calling you to fight for and not give up on?

594
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,220
 We show grace and patience,

595
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,740
 not just to put up with other people.

596
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,140
 A lot of times when you talk about patience,

597
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,460
 like God give me patience

598
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,020
 so I can put up with this other person,

599
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,900
 make it through the day.

600
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,300
 You know, that's like a lot of times

601
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,300
 how as Christians we think about patience,

602
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,060
 so I can just put up with somebody

603
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,340
 and move on with my life.

604
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,740
 It's not that, not that I say it loud,

605
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,100
 it's kind of, that's true, right?

606
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,820
 Yes, yes, yes, okay, good.

607
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,900
 But God doesn't just want us to put up with people.

608
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,020
 He wants us to fight for people,

609
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,940
 for the life of Christ to unfold in their lives.

610
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,220
 He wants us to be people who show patience and grace,

611
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,780
 you know, so that others can know Jesus,

612
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,100
 that they can know his love,

613
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,420
 that they're not written off and forgotten.

614
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,060
 That's what he calls us to do.

615
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:36,020
 So, but how do we actually have this patience?

616
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,380
 Well, it's all great, you know,

617
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,220
 you're talking about his patience,

618
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,260
 but I don't have any patience, pastor.

619
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,140
 What do I do?

620
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:47,260
 Well, there's a few things that we can do,

621
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,860
 but ultimately, and I'll share those in a second,

622
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,060
 but ultimately it is the Holy Spirit works on our life.

623
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,860
 This is a supernatural work of God in your life.

624
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,140
 You know, you're not gonna love somebody

625
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,820
 who doesn't feel great about you

626
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,500
 unless the power of God,

627
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,860
 the love of God is at work in your life.

628
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,500
 And that's where Christians are called to be different

629
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,700
 than other people.

630
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,780
 We're not showing patience to people we like,

631
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,820
 we show patience to all kinds of people,

632
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,500
 even when sometimes it's hard for us,

633
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,540
 and we're gonna seek their wellbeing,

634
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,820
 we're gonna seek what's good for them,

635
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,780
 'cause we wanna see God's goodness unfold in their lives.

636
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,420
 But, so what are some things that we do?

637
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,980
 Well, the first one, there's three things.

638
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,060
 The first one is we can pray to God

639
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,100
 and ask him to give us patience.

640
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,620
 Now, this for me is actually like an ongoing dialogue.

641
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,660
 It's not like, you know, one time at night I pray,

642
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,100
 five weeks ago, it forgot to give me patience.

643
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,780
 This is like every day, Jesus, give me patience.

644
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,340
 Forgive me for not being patient for other persons.

645
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,500
 Jesus, help me to seek the goodness of this person's life,

646
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,780
 even though I don't feel like it right now.

647
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,660
 Jesus, you know, give me grace.

648
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,540
 Jesus, forgive me for my attitude, blah, blah, blah.

649
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,940
 So this ongoing dialogue

650
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,940
 and relationship with God the Father.

651
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,980
 And when we do that, we give the Holy Spirit space

652
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,220
 'cause we're surrendering to God.

653
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,180
 Our Lord, here, here I am.

654
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,780
 You know, change me, transform me,

655
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,180
 make me a different person.

656
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,700
 And then the Holy Spirit works.

657
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,980
 Now, it's a very incremental change most of the time,

658
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,140
 meaning it's a slow process.

659
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,300
 But he really transforms who we are

660
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,700
 so that we can fight for people, for their well-being,

661
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,700
 be patient, be graceful, even in a different way

662
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,900
 because the Spirit of God is at work on us.

663
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,260
 So that's the first thing is praying.

664
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,500
 The second is we can practice being patient

665
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,100
 with others in our daily lives.

666
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,380
 Now, a lot of times you wanna do the big hero moment

667
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,300
 like Wolfram, who stepped up and showed patience to me.

668
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,220
 You know, it's like, I'm gonna be a hero.

669
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,060
 I'm gonna step up.

670
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:49,060
 I'm gonna show, you know, this very problematic youth child,

671
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,900
 you know, patience and grace.

672
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,860
 But actually, the way we become patient people

673
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,180
 is we practice daily in the little things in our lives.

674
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,500
 You know, patience with our spouses,

675
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,780
 patience with our friends, patience with our parents,

676
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,980
 patience with the people walking slowly in front of us,

677
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,220
 patience, you know, this is the training ground

678
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,020
 where we surrender and submit to God

679
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,780
 and ask him to give us patience.

680
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:21,140
 And then thirdly, we can meditate on God's patience,

681
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,980
 grace, and forgiveness he has shown us.

682
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,660
 A lot of times I find when I lack grace and patience

683
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,140
 for someone, I actually have forgotten

684
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,860
 what Jesus has done for me.

685
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,900
 And so when I go back to what Jesus has done for me,

686
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,140
 when I start not just quickly thinking about it,

687
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,620
 but actually taking time, saying, thank you, Jesus,

688
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,620
 you know, that you died for my sins on the cross,

689
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,020
 that you're so patient to even go to the cross for me,

690
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,300
 so graceful to do that for me, you know,

691
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,260
 with all my sin, all my junk,

692
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,860
 but you were willing to do that.

693
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,980
 So then suddenly as I meditate and pray over that

694
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,540
 and read that and give God thanks for that,

695
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,620
 then it puts this other little thing

696
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,940
 where I'm lacking grace, where I'm lacking patience,

697
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,660
 it puts that into perspective.

698
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,820
 And it's like, oh yeah, that's right.

699
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,060
 Sorry, Lord, that you showed me so much grace and patience,

700
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,780
 and I can't even show in this little instance

701
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,780
 grace and patience to this other person.

702
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,820
 And so those are three ways that we can invite

703
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,860
 the Holy Spirit to work and to bear

704
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,060
 the fruit of patience in our lives,

705
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,260
 and to become people who start fighting

706
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,740
 for the well-being, the flourishing of others,

707
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,740
 and that we can show this patience and grace

708
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,020
 so that can unfold in their lives.

709
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,380
 Now I wanna invite the worship team to come up,

710
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:50,100
 and I have some reflection questions for you.

711
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,380
 Where is your patience being tested right now?

712
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,820
 This past week, past month, this morning,

713
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,980
 on the way to church.

714
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,100
 Who are you struggling to be patient with?

715
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,740
 I found that I sometimes have certain personality types

716
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,780
 that I struggle with.

717
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,320
 You know, who are you struggling to be patient with?

718
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:21,100
 And then thirdly, who is God calling you to fight for,

719
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,580
 show grace and patience to, and not give up on?

720
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:31,660
 So I just wanna invite right now just a time of prayer.

721
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,340
 We're gonna take two minutes just for you and yourself,

722
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,940
 between you and God, just come before and just pray to Him,

723
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,820
 and ask Him to meet you in whatever is going on,

724
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,820
 wherever you need that patience and grace,

725
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,820
 or maybe He's highlighting somebody

726
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,300
 He wants you to fight for.

727
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,100
 And I just want to invite you to connect with God

728
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,900
 and to connect with the Holy Spirit.

729
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,020
 And so then two minutes time, I'll close us in a prayer.

730
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,380
 So let's do that right now.

731
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:01,280
 (gentle music)

732
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,860
 (gentle music)

733
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,140
 (gentle music)

734
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,720
 (gentle music)

735
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,300
 (gentle music)

736
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,880
 (gentle music)

737
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,460
 (gentle music)

738
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,040
 (gentle music)

739
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,620
 (gentle music)

740
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:32,080
 (gentle music)

741
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:38,080
 (gentle music)

742
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,620
 (gentle music)

743
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,200
 (gentle music)

744
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,200
 (gentle music)

745
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,200
 (gentle music)

746
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,200
 (gentle music)

747
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,200
 (gentle music)

748
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,780
 (gentle music)

749
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:38,900
 I wanna invite everyone to stand.

750
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,980
 (gentle music)

751
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,940
 And just as a pastor, just wanting to receive from God,

752
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,740
 I wanna invite you to stretch out your hands

753
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,240
 in front of you.

754
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,200
 It's like a posture of surrender, like, "Lord, here I am.

755
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,360
 "Just meet me.

756
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,560
 "Let me pray over you."

757
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:03,620
 Jesus, I thank you first and foremost

758
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,740
 that you have grace and patience for us.

759
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,620
 And maybe as some of us right now,

760
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,580
 we're reflecting, maybe we just felt bad

761
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,080
 about something that happened.

762
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,160
 But I thank you that you love forgiving us,

763
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,660
 that you love showing us grace,

764
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,580
 that you love showing us patience.

765
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,500
 So I pray right now that you show your love and grace

766
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,240
 and patience to those where that was what was going on.

767
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,780
 But Lord, I also thank you that we're a work in progress,

768
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,060
 that you are not finished with us,

769
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,540
 that you are shaping and molding us into patient people,

770
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,500
 graceful people that reflect your character

771
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,980
 in our everyday lives to the people around us.

772
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,340
 And Lord, I pray that as a church and as people,

773
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,620
 you would strengthen us, you would grow us,

774
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,480
 the Holy Spirit, that you would bear that fruit

775
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,860
 of patience in our lives,

776
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,060
 that we would be a patient church,

777
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,020
 that we would be patient with each other

778
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,500
 and graceful with each other,

779
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,520
 that we can be patient and graceful with those around us.

780
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,440
 And Lord, I pray that you strengthen us right now

781
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,240
 where we need that patience and grace,

782
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,400
 where we don't have it, where we're empty,

783
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,480
 but that you will give it.

784
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,600
 Lord, will you release your grace

785
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,320
 and your patience on us right now?

786
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,400
 Will you renew us?

787
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,040
 Will you strengthen us?

788
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,720
 And will you allow us to be people who for one,

789
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,080
 fight for one another here in this church,

790
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,040
 that we love each other,

791
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,400
 that we fight for each other's wellbeing,

792
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,120
 'cause we wanna see Christ fully formed in each other.

793
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,000
 But I also pray that you just put individuals

794
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,200
 on our hearts and minds,

795
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,560
 where we're the right person to fight for them.

796
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,600
 Whether today or later in the week,

797
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,400
 you just highlight someone,

798
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,880
 Tim, I want you to fight for this person.

799
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,680
 I want you to fight for that person.

800
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,960
 And Lord, will you give us the grace

801
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,360
 and the strength to do that?

802
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,660
 So Lord, we thank you for your love,

803
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,760
 your patience, your grace, for your work in our lives.

804
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,280
 And we give you all the praise and glory.

805
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,000
 And pray this in your name, Jesus, amen.
