1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
 In Jesus name.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,120
 Everyone says?

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
 Amen.

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,920
 Hey, can we thank our worship team as always?

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,960
 So good.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
 Have a seat.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,320
 I want to say particularly a warm welcome to everybody at the two o'clock service.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,960
 It's great to have you here together.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,920
 I'm sorry that I'm not with you in person today.

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,120
 I'm currently on a plane flying to Singapore where I'm going to be teaching at a conference

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,120
 there all week.

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,560
 So I couldn't actually physically be with you, but you're tuning into this and we're

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,880
 so glad that you're with us and I pray that even though you're watching this on a screen

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,280
 right now, that God will speak to you and that you'll hear the Holy Spirit challenging

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,080
 you in the areas that he has for you today.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,560
 So it's great that you're with us and welcome everybody who's here for the first time.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,120
 If you've never been to the Vine before, my name's Andrew.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,160
 I'm one of the pastors and it's grateful.

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
 We're so grateful.

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,160
 Even on a rainy day, a rainy day.

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,640
 I am flying off to Singapore this afternoon.

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
 It's so funny.

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,400
 I like checked the weather because I'm like, I need to get away from this crazy rain.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,760
 Like I'm so tired of it.

25
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
 I want to go somewhere.

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,040
 I'm going to see some sun.

27
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,800
 And I looked at the weather, the place that I'm going to be doing this conference in and

28
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,680
 it's raining there.

29
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,080
 So praise the Lord Jesus.

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,120
 So we continue our series in Ephesus today in Ephesians, the book.

31
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,400
 And we come to a passage that is very, very important to us as a church, very important

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,560
 to me as your pastor here.

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,000
 We come to what really is the central passage to I think Paul's whole book.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,800
 It's pretty much in the center of his book, but it's also the central passage to us and

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,200
 our vision here at the Vine.

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,400
 And if you've been coming to the Vine, and there's people in this room that have been

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,120
 coming to the Vine for 10, 20, 20 plus years.

38
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,840
 My prayer today is that you'll hear something fresh out of the passage that perhaps you've

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,480
 heard us teach on a few times before.

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,800
 But if you're relatively new here at the Vine, and to be honest with you, we've just done

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,680
 a survey in the last month or so to ask about who you are.

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,960
 And we know that many of you here have only been a part of this church for say one year,

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,720
 two years, or even less than that.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,440
 So we know that there's a lot of relatively new people.

45
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,560
 You may not have heard us speak about what is the central sort of heartbeat of our vision,

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,000
 why we do what we do as a church.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,600
 And more than that, what our heart is for you.

48
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,200
 If you align to the Vine Church, and if you say that the Vine Church is your home church,

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,080
 then everything I'm going to speak about over the next 30 minutes is specifically about

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
 you.

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,520
 It's about you, it's about your life, it's about what the Holy Spirit wants for you,

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,920
 because if this is your home church, what I'm sharing is the heart of everything that

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,560
 we do here as a church.

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,180
 And the catalyst to this heart started back in around about March of 2013.

55
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,160
 It was about nine months or so before I took over here as senior pastor in November of

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
 2013.

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,240
 In March 2013, I was praying, and if I'm honest with you, I was feeling very overwhelmed,

58
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,960
 I was feeling very nervous.

59
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,800
 I had imposter syndrome.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,160
 We had two phenomenal founding pastors here at the Vine, John and Tony, that had done

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,280
 such an incredible job of birthing and growing a church.

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,240
 And I was feeling, if I'm honest, the weight of picking up at a relatively young age at

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,920
 the time, I was relatively younger at the time, picking up a large church and trying

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,000
 to lead it off the back of two gentlemen that had led it so beautifully and so wonderfully.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 So in all of those insecurities and that kind of sense of pressure, I went to God and I

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,440
 was just praying, I was like, "God, look, I just want to understand your heart for these

67
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,600
 people in the season that's ahead.

68
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,920
 Because if I can understand your heart for them, then I think I can kind of get over

69
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,280
 myself and my inadequacies that I'm sensing and lean into what your heart is for these

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
 people."

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,600
 And as I was praying that, I heard God speak and He spoke, perhaps what I would say is

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,940
 the clearest He's ever spoken to me.

73
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,680
 It would probably be a lie to tell you that I've heard the audible voice of God.

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,040
 I don't know what the audible voice of God is.

75
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,160
 But this was probably one of the times in my life where I've heard Him speak into my

76
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,700
 soul.

77
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,480
 His Word just kind of hit me deeply in who I am.

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
 Here's what He said, it was very simple.

79
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,200
 He said, "Andrew, I don't want you to grow a big church, I want you to grow big people."

80
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,940
 And that shift changed everything for me.

81
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,520
 Because I was so anxious about taking on a large institution, a large church, and having

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,600
 to maybe grow that church even bigger.

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,560
 And God shifted it and He said, "Andrew, forget about the size of things, forget about the

84
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,360
 institution of it.

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,020
 What I want you to focus on is every single individual and my desire for them to grow

86
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,120
 in their relationship with me.

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,280
 I want you not to grow a big church, not that there's anything wrong with large churches,

88
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,400
 again, the vine over our three services is a relatively large church.

89
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,840
 But I don't want you to focus on trying to grow an institution, I want you to grow people."

90
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,800
 And I have to tell you, that resonated so deeply in me because I sense that that's my

91
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,320
 passion.

92
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,600
 That's everything that I want.

93
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,680
 I want you, and you've heard us say this at the Vine, if you've been coming for any period

94
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,160
 of time, you've probably heard this before.

95
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,720
 Whether you're here for two weeks, for two months, for two years, for two decades, I

96
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,880
 want you to grow in Christ Jesus.

97
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,360
 I want you to get to the end of a week and feel like because of your connection to the

98
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,760
 people in this room, because you feel like you're a part of a gathered community in Hong

99
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,480
 Kong, that you feel like you know Jesus more, you're deeper in connection with Him, you're

100
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,560
 walking more faithfully, you have a boldness to share the gospel like you've never had

101
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,080
 before, you have a mindset to understand justice and the vulnerable and the marginalized and

102
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,120
 wanting to make a difference, that you're looking at your workplace and the sphere of

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,480
 influence that Christ has planted you in, and you're saying, "How can I use the gifts

104
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,640
 and the talents and the spiritual things that God has given me to work out in the very place

105
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
 that I am?"

106
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,200
 Because you've heard this before, church is not 90 minutes on a Sunday, church is the

107
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,360
 gathered group of people wherever that might happen.

108
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,840
 That happens in the workplace.

109
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,880
 It happens in schools and universities.

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,000
 It happens with entrepreneurs.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,180
 It happens in families.

112
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,680
 It happens in any place that someone who professes the name of Jesus is rooted and present.

113
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,120
 Jesus is there and they can bring heaven to earth in that place.

114
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,260
 And if there's anything that drives the heartbeat of the vine, it is that.

115
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:20,440
 We love gathering together in these 90 minutes on a Sunday, but this is not the fullness

116
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,480
 of what church is about.

117
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,520
 Church actually comes more alive when you wake up on a Monday and you get dressed and

118
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,280
 you go into your workplace and you spend the majority of your time with people who don't

119
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,200
 know Jesus.

120
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,800
 I envy you.

121
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,480
 I spend most of my time with Christians.

122
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,600
 And I have to tell you, no, I won't go there.

123
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,000
 You get to spend most of your time with people who don't believe and what a beautiful, wonderful

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 thing that is.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,440
 So our vision here at the Vine is simply this, growing big people.

126
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,240
 Three words, that's it.

127
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,400
 Very easy for everybody to remember, growing big people.

128
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,720
 That's our desire, is that you would mature in your faith and that you would be so infused

129
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,160
 with the gospel, with understanding what that means through the life, death and resurrection

130
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,200
 of Jesus, through the birthing of the church and through the wonder of what it is to live

131
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,440
 reconciled with him, but also then to be in the ministry of reconciliation for others

132
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,160
 in the world that you're longing to grow and mature and deepen that relationship more and

133
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,600
 more as you go through life.

134
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,280
 For me, that's what this is all about.

135
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,160
 And I want you to hear this, we honestly believe here at the Vine that the local church is

136
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,520
 the hope of the world, the local church.

137
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,440
 And again, by that, I don't mean a building or an institution or an organization.

138
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,080
 I don't even mean services.

139
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,280
 I mean you and me.

140
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,840
 I mean our relationships.

141
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,280
 I mean community.

142
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,920
 I mean the gathered group of God's people together.

143
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,060
 That is the hope of the world.

144
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,060
 It's the hope of the world because God has always chosen in redemptive history right

145
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,400
 from the beginning of all things, from Genesis chapter four and then the calling of Abraham

146
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,140
 and the formation of Israel from Genesis chapter 12.

147
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,360
 What it's all been about is that God has said, "I'm going to reveal my character, my nature,

148
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,640
 my truth, my heart, my love through my gathered people."

149
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,560
 I mean that's what Israel was all about in the Old Testament.

150
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,480
 And that's why God gathers them at Mount Sinai and pours out his heart to them in the law

151
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,760
 because he wants them to be this physical representation of his character.

152
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,560
 That's what the gathered church is about.

153
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,920
 It's why Jesus told them to stay in the upper room until he pours out his spirit so that

154
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,600
 they could be filled with that law that is no longer on a tablet of stone but is now

155
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,880
 written on the softness of their hearts by the spirit of Christ, the same spirit that

156
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,100
 raised Jesus from the dead, now given to them the birthing of the church so that they could

157
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,080
 then go out and represent the character and the heart and the passion and the saving grace

158
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,280
 of Christ Jesus to the world.

159
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,200
 That's what it's always been about.

160
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,960
 So if you want to know what the answer is to some of the greatest challenges that we're

161
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:12,840
 seeing in the world today, it is you and it is me, it is us, the church, the people of

162
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,680
 Christ.

163
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,840
 And see this is really important.

164
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,680
 The reason why our vision of growing big people is really important is because 91% of people

165
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,040
 in Hong Kong do not know Jesus.

166
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
 You know that?

167
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,280
 That's the latest statistic.

168
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:34,840
 91% of people in our city do not know Jesus, which means we have an awesome responsibility

169
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,760
 and an incredibly exciting...

170
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,800
 What other city would you want to live in than that?

171
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,520
 A city that desperately needs the very thing that sits in your heart, the very thing that

172
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,680
 has captured your life, the very thing that has transformed you and saved you and sets

173
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,240
 you free, the very thing that wakes you up in the morning with your heart beating faster

174
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
 to say, "I'm so grateful that I know Christ."

175
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,960
 91% of the people in our city do not have that experience, but they could through the

176
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,720
 church.

177
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,280
 Not by trying to get everybody in here, but by trying to release all of us out there.

178
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,920
 That's the river model vision here at The Vine.

179
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,640
 That's why we're growing big people, but we have this idea of the river model where all

180
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,800
 of us has a spirit influence that we're rooted in, where we get to live out the beauty and

181
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,320
 the wonder of the things that we talk about here on a Sunday.

182
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,400
 And that's important because what Christ wants for His church is that it would be His hands

183
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,000
 and feet in every aspect of society, in every part.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,280
 And in this room right now and over our three services, even in the two o'clock, you represent

185
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,480
 the beauty and the wonder of some aspect of Hong Kong society.

186
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,080
 And what a powerful thing it is to think that the church is in the law firms, that the church

187
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,440
 is in the government, in the corridors of power, that the church is in the police force,

188
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,040
 that the church is in our universities and education institutions, that the church is

189
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,240
 almost everywhere in our society, hopefully bringing the love of Christ to that place.

190
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,200
 See, the reason why this is important as well, the reason why we want to grow big people

191
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,400
 here is because a mature church is not easily shaken.

192
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,280
 And I tell you what, the world is shaking right now.

193
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,920
 With all of the economic challenges and the political challenges around the world, the

194
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,720
 world is more in war today than it has been five years ago, ten years ago.

195
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,080
 The world is more at war, not just physically and violently as we see around in various

196
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,600
 different conflicts, but at war culturally with each other.

197
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
 It's never been more like that than ever right now.

198
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,960
 And in the midst of that, wouldn't it be amazing if there was a presence of a group of people

199
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,380
 who despite the fact that everything else was shaking and everything else seems scary

200
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,280
 and overwhelming, there was a group of people who were rooted in something, grounded in

201
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,120
 something that was so sure and so strong to them, that despite the fact that they may

202
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,480
 also feel a bit of fear at times, that they may also sense that there is this change that's

203
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,840
 happening, they could say, "There is a rootedness that we can have, and I am not afraid because

204
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,720
 my hope is not here.

205
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
 My hope is in Christ.

206
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,240
 And because my hope is in Christ, I have salvation.

207
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,880
 I have a solid rock on which I'm building my life, and everything else can shake, but

208
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
 there is hope."

209
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,960
 I tell you, when you're living in a culture and a society and a city that is shaking like

210
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,320
 Hong Kong's is, people are looking for those who are secure.

211
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,320
 And they're thinking maybe that security is found in money.

212
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,200
 And when the economy shakes, everybody gets overwhelmed and fearful.

213
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,280
 Or maybe that security is found in some relationship.

214
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,040
 If I could just get married or date somebody or find a hot girl that I've been looking

215
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,560
 for or the stable guy that I want, we think that's where our security will come.

216
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,200
 And the church has the opportunity to stand up in the midst of all of those conversations

217
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
 and say that there's only one place where true security comes, and that's outside of

218
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,340
 yourself in the one who's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

219
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,920
 Which is why, when we're growing big people here at the Vine, we're doing it because a

220
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,040
 mature church can offer an alternative vision of life.

221
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,840
 I tell you what, in the conversations that I have, I know I just told you that I spend

222
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,280
 most of my time with Christians, which I do.

223
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,680
 But in the conversations I have with my non-Christian friends and the non-Christian community that

224
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,680
 I have, I constantly hear this communication.

225
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,640
 It's basically, I wonder if there's another way to live because the system is not working

226
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
 for us right now.

227
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,240
 I tell you what, post-modernism has failed this world.

228
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,840
 It had this great hope when it started, but it's failed people, and they've realized that.

229
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,480
 Modernism, materialism failed us.

230
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,040
 Actually the extreme polarizations of elements of culture, extreme liberalism is failing,

231
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,320
 extreme conservatism, the right wing side of things, which has led to, in history, some

232
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,160
 really bad things, is failing.

233
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,920
 And so in the midst of that, people are looking for an alternative way of life.

234
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,400
 They are wanting, literally, to be awoken to the reality that there is another way to

235
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,720
 live that can bring hope and life and charity and kindness and goodness, and actually see

236
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,460
 the world come together more than to be driven apart like it seems at the moment.

237
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,760
 And people are looking for where that alternative life is.

238
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,200
 And if the church remains silent, people are going to look over our heads to something

239
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,760
 else.

240
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,520
 And as we begin to speak up, and as we begin to mature, as we begin to grow in our relationship

241
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,760
 with Christ, we begin to hold forth and hold fast the Word of God in the world.

242
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,580
 We begin to say, "This is a new way to live.

243
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,720
 This is a way that you can know peace, where even though the world might be going crazy,

244
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,640
 there's a solidness to shalom, to peace, to reconciliation that you can know right here

245
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
 and right now."

246
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,760
 Could you imagine Hong Kong as a city who, in this shaking time, would look out to a

247
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,680
 church that was so rooted in its maturity in Christ that people were like, "I want to

248
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,920
 be a part of that."

249
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
 That's our vision.

250
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,160
 I mean, that's really what Growing Big People is all about.

251
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,360
 I think God is looking for that kind of church.

252
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,680
 And I'm not saying that the Vine is that kind of church.

253
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,680
 I'm saying that's the goal.

254
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,040
 That's the challenge that Christ has placed upon us as a community here.

255
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,000
 I think this is essentially the kind of church that God is looking for.

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,120
 Let me read this to you.

257
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,680
 Filled with people who are confident in what they believe, mature in their experience of

258
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,680
 the kingdom and the works of God, literate in their understanding of His Word and its

259
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,900
 narrative, experienced in their healing and their restoration, skilled in their advocacy

260
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,960
 for justice, and planted with hope in the brokenness of the world.

261
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,240
 That's a church I want to be a part of.

262
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,880
 And again, by church, don't think Vine, institution.

263
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,960
 Think a group of people who believe this and have dedicated sacrificially their life to

264
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,440
 living out this.

265
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,880
 I think that's what Christ died for.

266
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,360
 I think Christ did not die for an immature church.

267
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,520
 Christ died for this kind of community.

268
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,120
 And my heart, our heart as a leadership here at the Vine, if you call the Vine your home

269
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
 community, this is what we're hoping to go towards.

270
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,360
 This is the goal that we're trying to attain to.

271
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,560
 This is what we're trying to move together in.

272
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,980
 And as we mature individually, we mature communally.

273
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:26,520
 And I believe we take steps towards becoming a church like this that could truly, truly

274
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:33,440
 change that statistic from 91% who don't know Jesus to whatever percent, hopefully, we can

275
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,440
 get it to where they do.

276
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,680
 Is anyone else excited about that?

277
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
 No?

278
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
 Okay.

279
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
 That's great.

280
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,120
 Now what I want to do is I want to show you how Paul, I think, places so much of what

281
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,480
 I've been talking about with you so far into this passage we're looking at today.

282
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,000
 As we continue our series in Ephesians, we come to Ephesians 4, verses 11 to 16.

283
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,320
 And this is Paul's growing big people moment.

284
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,920
 This is him explaining to his church in Ephesus his heart for them to mature and to grow.

285
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:13,600
 And not only does he explain the idea of it, he actually maps out a process in these verses

286
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,800
 by which his church could mature more.

287
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,400
 And I love this because what I'm going to do is, after I read it, is I'm going to break

288
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
 that down for you.

289
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,560
 I'm actually going to show you the process that Paul provides for his church because

290
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,240
 what Paul is trying to do in Ephesus, we're trying to do here at the Vine.

291
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,800
 It is to grow a church of mature believers for a purpose of trying to change the world.

292
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,880
 And that was definitely Paul's heart as a pastor.

293
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,040
 It's our heart here.

294
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,880
 So let me read this to you from Ephesians 4, starting in verse 11.

295
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,540
 It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, some

296
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,920
 to be pastors, and some to be teachers, to prepare God's people for works of service,

297
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,600
 so that the body of Christ may be built up in unity, built up until we reach unity in

298
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,560
 the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, and we become mature, attaining to

299
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,440
 the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

300
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,760
 Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and

301
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,520
 there by every wind of teaching and by the cunningness and craftiness of people in their

302
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,680
 deceitful scheming.

303
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,280
 No, instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Him who is

304
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,600
 the head, that is Christ.

305
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,040
 From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds

306
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:36,040
 itself up in love as each part does its work.

307
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,800
 Paul has such a passion for his church in this moment because he wants them to see something

308
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,840
 that I think he felt they were failing to see up until this point.

309
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,880
 He's just spent three chapters talking about what Christ has done in His grace in their

310
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,040
 lives, and we've unpacked that in this series so far.

311
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,480
 But here in chapter four, he starts by saying, "I want you to live a life that is worthy

312
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,040
 of the calling you've received."

313
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,120
 Susanna beautifully unpacked that for us last week.

314
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,080
 She challenged us to understand how we can walk in kindness and humility and goodness

315
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,640
 towards one another.

316
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,040
 Now Paul's going to take this idea of what it is to live a life worthy of the calling

317
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,880
 you've received and show you how that works in the church, how there is this process of

318
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,560
 living a life that's truly worthy of that calling through maturity in Him.

319
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,400
 And so I want to map this out for you.

320
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,440
 The first thing he does is he says, "Look, there's three things that are central to the

321
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,060
 idea of maturing in a church.

322
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,960
 Any church that is going to seek to mature people, you need to understand that God has

323
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,320
 created three specific elements that work for that.

324
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,760
 The first he talks about, which we've come in the modern church to call the five-fold

325
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,600
 ministry gifts, he just speaks about five types of giftings that have been placed in

326
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,800
 the church to help that church to grow.

327
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,840
 He says apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers.

328
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,800
 These are not professional employees.

329
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,040
 These are people within the church themselves that are walking and ministering and living

330
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,480
 in certain gifts that are for the maturity of the church itself.

331
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,400
 Now, we don't have time today to unpack what those five different things are and the different

332
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,600
 nuances of each of them.

333
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,760
 It suffice to say that God has taken care of the community of His church by gifting

334
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,960
 it with such a way that there is diversity, there is different ideas of those gifts, they

335
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,800
 bring different things to the table, but seen together in their totality, they're designed

336
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,680
 to help the church to grow.

337
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,040
 They're designed to help the church to mature and to deepen in their faith.

338
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,200
 And so every church should be thinking, "How do we have these five things at work amongst

339
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 us?"

340
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,080
 Again, they're not offices or they're not like titles.

341
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,960
 These are gifts that are at work amongst us so that we might be able to do something.

342
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,880
 And I'll explain what that do something is in a moment.

343
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,360
 But notice how Paul writes it.

344
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,480
 He says, "God has given some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be…"

345
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,680
 He doesn't say God has called.

346
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,420
 He doesn't say God has made.

347
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,360
 He says God has given these gifts.

348
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,760
 So the focus is not on the person.

349
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
 Look at me.

350
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,160
 The focus is on God gifting.

351
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,520
 In other words, it is a movement of His grace into a church community so that church community

352
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
 can grow.

353
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:31,280
 And because it's a gift, it's given in order to achieve and accomplish something.

354
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,120
 And I'm going to explain about that in just a moment.

355
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,680
 So the first element is there is these gifts that God has placed amongst us.

356
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,880
 Now, the second element comes out in verse 15.

357
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,920
 He says, "Now, speaking the truth in love."

358
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,120
 So Paul says, "Not only is it important to have these five common gifts at work in

359
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,120
 your body to make it mature, you also need to be speaking the truth in love."

360
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
 I love this.

361
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,440
 Paul's saying a mature church is a church that doesn't shy away from the absolute

362
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,960
 truth of God.

363
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,720
 The absolute truth of Scripture, the absolute truth of the gospel and the life, death, and

364
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
 resurrection of Jesus.

365
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:13,040
 As a church embeds itself in the truth and shares that truth, speaks that truth, encourages

366
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,720
 that truth amongst them, it then grows and it matures.

367
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,440
 I love this.

368
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
 Speaking the truth.

369
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,760
 Now, this is really important because I think in the world today, particularly in our postmodern

370
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,520
 context, there's been attack on the idea of absolute truth.

371
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,160
 And instead, it's all about subjective truth or relative truth.

372
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,720
 And whatever that subjective truth or relative truth is for you, you should embrace that.

373
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,800
 But it will be different for the subjective or relative truth for someone else.

374
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,880
 And you can't judge anybody else's subjective truth.

375
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,240
 And so what we've got now is a culture, even in our time right now, where you'll hear this

376
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,480
 phrase a lot, "Own your truth."

377
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,860
 Just own your truth.

378
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,760
 It's good for you to own your truth, which basically means you can believe whatever you

379
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
 want.

380
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,000
 You can believe whatever you want and never the two shall meet.

381
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,320
 And I tell you what, us Christians, we've embraced this.

382
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,720
 I'm being honest.

383
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,380
 We've embraced this.

384
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,040
 This is how I think we so often are when we're around those that don't know Jesus.

385
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,320
 We're like, "Well, I've got my faith and I want to respect their space.

386
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,800
 And I have my faith.

387
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,040
 I have my truth.

388
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
 They have their truth.

389
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,440
 And we're just going to like..."

390
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,760
 I want you to know something really clearly.

391
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,320
 You don't have my truth.

392
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,520
 You have the truth.

393
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,720
 Come on, church.

394
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,180
 You don't have just, "This is my truth and that's something else over there."

395
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,080
 You have the absolute truth.

396
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,580
 The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus is an absolute truth.

397
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,160
 And Paul's saying the church matures when it doesn't shy away from the reality that

398
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,960
 there is an absolute truth, that there is something that the world revolves around,

399
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,760
 that there is a creator who's created this world and poured his heart and life into it

400
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,280
 and wants to have relationship with the people that he's created.

401
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,720
 And the church embraces and is willing to speak up for the absolute truth of Scripture.

402
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,320
 Paul says the church grows.

403
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,520
 It matures.

404
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,160
 The people there mature.

405
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,600
 And it's a wonderful thing.

406
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
 Notice this though.

407
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,560
 He qualifies it by saying, "In love."

408
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,120
 Which is another problem because the church over history hasn't done that.

409
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,240
 They've taught the absolute truth, but sometimes not in love.

410
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,880
 From a posture of judgment, from a posture of finger pointing, from a posture of, "You're

411
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,760
 not as good as us and you need to get better, so hear this truth."

412
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:33,960
 Paul said, "No, we don't shy away from the absolute truth that we're rooted in as Christians,

413
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:40,360
 but we do it, we share it, we speak it in love with one another and with those out there."

414
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
 It's done from a place of love.

415
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,040
 And remember, he's just prayed a prayer to them at the end of chapter 3 where his pastoral

416
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,680
 prayer was all about, "I want you to be changed inside through your knowledge of the love

417
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
 of God.

418
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,400
 I want you to know the height and the depth and the width and the length of that love.

419
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,000
 And I want that love to so transform you that it will surpass your understanding and it

420
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,880
 will fill you with the fullness of God."

421
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,840
 He's just prayed passionately that they would know love.

422
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,000
 Then he says, "Now speak the truth out of the overflow of the love that's in you."

423
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,080
 When you share the absolute truth of the gospel with someone from a place of love, you share

424
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,080
 it not from a idea of, "I need to judge this person because their behavior is bad."

425
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,880
 You share it from, "Man, I so long for this person to flourish and grow and be transformed

426
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,960
 because could you imagine the lawyer they could be if they actually believed in Christ?"

427
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,760
 You're looking at it from a completely different perspective because you want the person to

428
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,560
 grow and flourish and be the best that they can be and your heart's somewhat broken that

429
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,160
 they're not living in the way that God has created them to be, but you're not judging

430
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
 them.

431
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,480
 You're sharing the truth in a place of love.

432
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,040
 Paul says when that happens, you have a mature church.

433
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,880
 An immature church shies away from absolute truth.

434
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,160
 I know that's not a popular thing to say, so I'm going to say it again.

435
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,280
 An immature church shies away from absolute truth, but a mature church is willing to stand

436
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,240
 on the truth of Scripture but do so in love.

437
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,800
 The third thing he says is he says, "You've got to understand that Christ is the head

438
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,520
 of the church and we are his body."

439
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,840
 So he shares about there's an authority structure in the church.

440
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,200
 Not an authority structure that's human made, an authority structure that comes with Christ

441
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
 as the head.

442
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,280
 All authority is in him.

443
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,840
 He said this at the beginning in Ephesians chapter 1.

444
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,000
 He said, "The will of God is that all things on heaven and earth would come under one person

445
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 that is Christ."

446
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,640
 So Christ is the ultimate authority, he says, but he gets, "We are his body.

447
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
 We get to be his body."

448
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,760
 And this is a beautiful thing because as the body of Christ, we get to be different parts.

449
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,880
 Our differences are a good thing.

450
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,600
 Our backgrounds and our talents and our gifts that are different from one another, they're

451
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,680
 all good things.

452
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,480
 As we bring them together in this one body, we build each other up.

453
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
 It's a beautiful thing.

454
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
 We grow in Christ.

455
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,560
 We mature, he's basically saying.

456
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,400
 And so this idea of being a body means not all of us are the head, not all of us are

457
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,080
 the hand, not all of us are the feet.

458
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,120
 Some of us are this, some of that.

459
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,520
 Some of us are even the spleen.

460
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,440
 Nobody wants to be the spleen, but some of us in this room, you're the spleen.

461
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,520
 That's the metaphor he uses in 1 Corinthians 12.

462
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,840
 We're all different parts of the body, but together we make up this wonderful thing.

463
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,360
 So Paul is saying a maturing church happens because there are servants that are there

464
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
 to serve.

465
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,000
 There's revelation that is heard amongst us, and there is a community in which is developing

466
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,600
 in that space.

467
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,160
 So servant-hearted leadership, revelation of God's truth, and a community of people

468
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,480
 working together is part of the journey of maturing the church.

469
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,000
 And Paul is saying if those three things are not at work, you will fail to see a maturing

470
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 church.

471
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,560
 And if those three things are not at work in your life, you will probably fail to mature

472
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,200
 yourself in the way that Christ would want you to mature.

473
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,320
 Those three things are non-negotiables.

474
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
 Helping so far?

475
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
 Yeah.

476
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
 Thanks, Allison.

477
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,960
 Actually, I just heard everybody at the two say yes.

478
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
 Thanks, two.

479
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
 I appreciate you.

480
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
 All right.

481
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,380
 Now, look what happens next.

482
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,520
 So he's just said, look, there's three elements.

483
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,760
 He said these three elements work towards one goal.

484
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
 Notice this.

485
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,480
 He says, "So that they would prepare God's people for works of service."

486
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,160
 I love that.

487
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,000
 Notice he doesn't say, "So that they would prepare God's people to come to church on

488
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Sunday."

489
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,520
 He doesn't say that they'll prepare God's people to feel better about themselves.

490
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,920
 He says, "These things prepare God's people for what he describes works of service."

491
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,600
 So Paul's vision for a maturing church is not a church that's passive, a church that's

492
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,420
 active.

493
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,360
 His vision for people that are a part of a church is not that they would come in and

494
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,120
 only receive, but that they would be actively doing and giving and working out there somewhere

495
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,680
 in the world.

496
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,780
 His vision for a church that's maturing is not a church that's filled with people who

497
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:56,720
 are just here to consume, but a church that's filled with people that are dying to contribute.

498
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,520
 Because all of these things, this idea of servant leadership, revelation, and community,

499
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,880
 they're all working towards preparing God's people for the works that God has for them

500
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,200
 to do.

501
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,760
 The three things on this side are the things that we should be supplying to you here at

502
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,840
 the Vine as your leadership and how you should be supplying to one another, but it's to prepare

503
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,240
 you to go and do something.

504
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
 I think one way of thinking about it is this.

505
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,920
 The servants in the church are to prepare the church so that the church could be the

506
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,560
 servants to the world.

507
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
 Come on church, did you follow that?

508
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,280
 So the servant leadership within the church is to prepare the church to be the servant

509
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,240
 leaders of the world.

510
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,320
 So you could be in your marketplace situation, in the law firm, in the school, in the university,

511
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,400
 wherever it is, the family, whatever, and you're there going, "How do I do this for

512
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,380
 the people around me?

513
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,480
 How do I serve?

514
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,800
 How do I share the gospel?

515
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,940
 How do I live up the character and the nature of Christ to the people around me?

516
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,840
 Because I have been equipped by my community together to be a work of service to the community

517
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
 I'm planted in.

518
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,080
 That my sphere of influence, I'm the pastor to that sphere of influence, you should be

519
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
 thinking.

520
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:13,640
 I'm God's hands and feet to that place and I can make a difference because of my community

521
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,660
 of faith and how we're serving one another and working together.

522
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:23,040
 We can be living out acts of service wherever it is that you're planted.

523
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,960
 I think that's a glorious vision for church.

524
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,840
 It's not about like, "Hey, let's all come in and contribute everything here," although

525
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,460
 we do need you to contribute things here, right?

526
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,760
 We need volunteers, we need our helpers, we need the worship team.

527
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,240
 Everything that you see pretty much on a Sunday, most of it is run by volunteers.

528
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,560
 Yeah, we need the help here, but really the heart that Paul has for the church is that

529
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,820
 it would be so equipped for the work that it has to do out there.

530
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,720
 And that should inspire you.

531
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,900
 That should fill you with a hunger to want to mature so that you can be a greater representation

532
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,360
 of Christ's hands and feet wherever it is that you might find yourself.

533
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,320
 So Paul says all of this stuff, what it does as we prepare our works of service is that

534
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,220
 it brings unity together.

535
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,480
 We are built up, as the church he says, in unity.

536
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
 I love that.

537
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,320
 In other words, everybody here, if we were actually living out the call of the gospel

538
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,480
 in whatever sphere of influence we are, our role amongst each other should be to cheer

539
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
 each other on.

540
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,440
 It should be to say, "Wow, did you hear what this person did in the law firm the other

541
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
 week?

542
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
 Amazing.

543
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,900
 They were able to do this because they had this mindset of what justice was and the heart

544
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,940
 of God and justice.

545
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
 And they did that.

546
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
 We want to cheer you on.

547
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,940
 We want to say that was awesome.

548
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,940
 It's great."

549
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,640
 Or, "Hey, do you know that this person who's the CEO of this massive company, they're really

550
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
 struggling right now.

551
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,700
 They're under a lot of pressure.

552
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,500
 We need to gather around as a church and pray for them and stand with them so that they

553
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,420
 can be all that Christ has called them to be in that place in this season."

554
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,980
 Or, "Hey, you know this single mother who's having to raise two kids and she's struggling

555
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,420
 to pay rent every week?

556
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,480
 Hey, come on, we should be gathering around and building unity together to help her and

557
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,200
 provide for her and do whatever we can to make sure she's the best mom to those kids

558
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,600
 that she could possibly be."

559
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,960
 Could you imagine a church who's doing all of this stuff so that they could see unity

560
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,160
 be built up amongst themselves?

561
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,700
 That's something people would want to be a part of.

562
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:14,080
 And this unity, Paul says, he said, "We build up this unity in two very specific things."

563
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:21,960
 He said, "The unity is found in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God."

564
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,900
 Faith and the knowledge of the Son of God.

565
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,880
 This is what happens when unity is at work amongst us.

566
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,600
 We have unity in faith and unity in knowledge.

567
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,120
 Paul often brings faith and knowledge together when he's teaching.

568
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,840
 And he does so because it's really important for him because these two things are slightly

569
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,440
 different emphasis for Paul.

570
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,720
 Emphasis for Paul spoke mostly about our experience with God.

571
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,360
 It spoke about our beliefs and our promises or understanding the promises of God and our

572
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,920
 trust in Him.

573
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,160
 The faith element was the bits where we don't understand where we need faith.

574
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,120
 Maybe we haven't got it all worked out in our mind so we have this faith to believe

575
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,980
 or faith to trust or faith to embrace the promises of God.

576
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,760
 Even though perhaps we don't fully understand them at times or maybe we haven't felt them

577
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,720
 at times, we have this faith in us, he says, and we have this unity together in faith in

578
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
 the Son of God.

579
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,920
 But then he also says, "But it's also a knowledge."

580
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,980
 It's not all just about faith.

581
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:23,520
 It's also about being rooted in understanding, having wisdom, having good doctrine, understanding

582
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,320
 theology, understanding the Scriptures.

583
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,680
 This side is also important, Paul is saying.

584
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,320
 Our unity, if you're a maturing church, our unity if you're a maturing Christian, is that

585
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,640
 you have feet in both of those camps, that you have a balance between your faith in the

586
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,840
 Son of God and you have a balance with your understanding, your knowledge of the Son of

587
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
 God.

588
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,560
 He's like, "You need to get both of those things in balance because if one of those

589
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:52,080
 things dominates more over the other, then you're going to be an immature church that's

590
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,280
 likely to be shaken by every whim of teaching that's going to come your way."

591
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,960
 We all know this, right?

592
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,280
 We all know those churches or those experiences where it's all built on just some spiritual

593
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,600
 dramatic experience, and yet it seems to lack the rootedness of Scripture.

594
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,960
 And perhaps we've been in other churches at times where it's amazing the doctrinal understanding

595
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,600
 and teaching, and yet it seems like it's dead, that it's not alive, that there's no spirit

596
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
 involved.

597
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,320
 And Paul's trying to teach the church where our unity comes, our maturity comes.

598
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,160
 When we take both of those things and we embrace them and walk into them and find balance in

599
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,920
 them in our lives, here at the Vine we put it this way, we want you to be a spiritually

600
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,400
 intelligent Christian.

601
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,680
 We want you to be so filled with the Spirit that you have those experiences of Christ.

602
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,080
 You're gifted by the Spirit.

603
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,360
 You know that the same Spirit in you is the one that raised Jesus from the dead.

604
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,620
 You're praying for the sick.

605
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,840
 You're looking for miracles.

606
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,900
 You're expecting for that.

607
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,760
 We want that in you, but we also want you to know your word.

608
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,080
 We want you to be rooted in Scripture.

609
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,920
 We want you to understand theology.

610
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,640
 We want you to know how the Bible works.

611
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,400
 We want you to stand on that absolute truth and have that.

612
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,520
 We want you to have both of those things at work in your life.

613
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,960
 That's maturity, Paul says.

614
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
 That's what it is to grow.

615
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,540
 Are you still with me?

616
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,760
 So all of this reaches to the end of the point where he says this, and so we would become

617
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,720
 mature, and notice how he defines maturity, "attaining to the whole measure of the fullness

618
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,280
 of God."

619
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
 The whole measure of the full...

620
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
 Yeah, that's a good slide to take a photo of.

621
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
 Yep, everybody's taking a photo of that.

622
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
 That's nice.

623
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,720
 Although, ha, ha, ha, ha, there's one more bit, so sorry.

624
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,040
 We're going to have to take a photo again in a few minutes' time.

625
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,600
 But I want you to see, he's saying, "We become mature, attaining to the whole measure of

626
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,880
 the fullness of Christ."

627
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,440
 His vision is that you wouldn't miss out on anything that Christ has for you and for the

628
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
 church.

629
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,280
 The fullness of Christ should be found in you and found in the church.

630
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,720
 He's basically saying, "Look, Christ did not die so that you received a portion of His

631
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,320
 love.

632
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,080
 Christ didn't die so that you would receive a portion of reconciliation, a portion of

633
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
 restoration."

634
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,520
 Paul's like, "No, a mature church and a mature person in Christ is someone who understands

635
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,880
 that they are receiving the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

636
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,640
 We don't do the vines so that you would get a half measure."

637
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,280
 I mean, if that was our focus, then we may as well just wrap up and go home.

638
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,160
 We do this because we want you to sense the wholeness of His love, the wholeness of restoration,

639
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,800
 the wholeness of your healing.

640
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,580
 Whatever brokenness that you're with, whatever addiction you're struggling with, whatever

641
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:33,520
 overwhelming fears in your workplace, whatever it is, divorce that you're struggling with

642
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,320
 in your marriage, a breakdown in a relationship, whatever it is, we want the wholeness of Christ

643
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,440
 for you in those areas.

644
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,640
 So that you would feel fully alive in Him, forgiven, redeemed, restored, growing, and

645
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,500
 making a difference.

646
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,280
 So that you would have a limp like Jacob did, who wrestled with God because of the hard

647
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,800
 things and God touched him.

648
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:00,160
 And he walked away touched by the work of God and able to reveal the beauty of His brokenness

649
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,440
 to those ahead and to point people towards the One who healed him.

650
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,040
 And I pray that that is us, that that is what it means to be church.

651
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,600
 That's growing big people.

652
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,680
 And the question you've got to wrestle with here is, when you see Paul map out, I mean,

653
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,320
 is that not a beautiful process that he's mapped out?

654
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,080
 When you see Paul map out a process like that, here's the question we think.

655
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,880
 We think that Paul's being mean about people who are infants in Jesus.

656
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,280
 We could read that and think, Paul's got a problem with people who are just coming to

657
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,680
 Jesus or don't know much about Jesus.

658
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,440
 And if that's you here in this room, maybe you're new to faith or maybe you're wrestling

659
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,640
 with faith, you're not sure, I want you to hear this.

660
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,480
 That is not what Paul is saying.

661
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,680
 He is not coming against those who are infants in the faith.

662
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,360
 Equally, there are people who are mature in Christ Jesus who think because they've been

663
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,280
 Christians for 30, 40 years, that they don't have much more to learn about Christ.

664
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,680
 He's coming for those people actually.

665
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,640
 And he's saying both whether you're an infant in Christ or whether you think you're mature

666
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,160
 and you've got it all sorted out.

667
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,060
 He's basically saying, if you just stay stagnant where you're at, that's not what Christ wants.

668
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,160
 He wants a maturing church, a maturing Christian.

669
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,280
 And so if you're an infant, that's absolutely fine.

670
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,080
 Your heart though should be, I want to learn, I want to grow, I want to deepen, I want to

671
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
 get mature.

672
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,240
 And if you are a "mature Christian", you should be challenging yourself and saying, have I

673
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,280
 plateaued?

674
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,920
 Have I thought in arrogance that I know it all?

675
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,160
 Is there more for me to know of Christ?

676
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
 Absolutely there is.

677
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,600
 And so whether infant or mature, the heart Paul is saying is that you have a starting

678
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,640
 point right in this process right now.

679
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,560
 Whether you've been a Christian two weeks or two minutes or 20, 30, 40 years, there's

680
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,280
 a starting point for you.

681
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,480
 And that's the final part of the slide.

682
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,920
 You can now take a photo of the slide if you want to.

683
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,800
 There is the starting point that we all have.

684
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,000
 And that starting point is what you're being invited into today.

685
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,560
 If this is your home church, I hope what I've shared with you today out of Paul's vision,

686
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,480
 this is not actually the Vine's vision as in like we've come up with something special.

687
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,440
 Our vision is that vision and that vision is Paul's vision for his church.

688
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,600
 This is Paul mapping out what maturity in the church looks like.

689
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,040
 But that is what we align ourselves and that's what we mean when we say we're here to grow

690
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,200
 big people.

691
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
 That's what we're talking about.

692
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,640
 That's everything we do strategically.

693
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,760
 We want that process to be at work in our ministries and how we do things.

694
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,200
 We want that process to be at work in your life and everything you experience.

695
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,920
 We'd love that process to be at work outside the four walls of a 90-minute Sunday service.

696
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,240
 That's our heart and our passion.

697
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,480
 The question you've got to ask yourself is where are you starting on your ever going

698
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,960
 maturity journey today?

699
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,160
 And so for some of you in this room, your starting point might be like, you know what,

700
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,880
 I need to understand more about the truth.

701
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,280
 You know what, I've shied away a little bit from God's absolute truth.

702
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,600
 Maybe I've been a bit scared about it.

703
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
 I need to actually embrace it.

704
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,320
 I need to read my scriptures a bit more.

705
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,800
 I need to talk to somebody about that.

706
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,120
 I need to understand what are the foundations of gospel.

707
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,520
 I need to understand what is doctrine.

708
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,600
 I don't even know what doctrine is or theology.

709
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,960
 I need someone to walk with me.

710
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,360
 Maybe it's to sign up for a BSF class or do a manna class here at the Vine where we do

711
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,760
 Bible teaching with you.

712
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,760
 It could be a whole variety of different things, but you're kind of saying, that's my starting

713
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
 point.

714
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,600
 Or maybe for some of you it's to get into a community group.

715
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,720
 You've realized that you've been anonymous here too long and you've been wondering why

716
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,000
 it is that maybe you're not growing as much as you thought.

717
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,640
 Let me tell you this, you will grow far more with eight to nine to ten people around your

718
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,920
 life who know your story and you know their story than you will from attending a lifetime's

719
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,240
 worth of 90 minutes on a Sunday.

720
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,280
 That's where true discipleship takes place.

721
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,880
 Not here, as much as we love what we're doing here.

722
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,120
 I know I've said that a few times today, but we love this, but that's actually not the

723
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,480
 fullness of your discipleship.

724
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,400
 Your discipleship will go to the next level when you commit your life to communing with

725
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
 people.

726
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,760
 So, CGs, community groups, massive.

727
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,160
 Maybe that's your starting point here today.

728
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,440
 Maybe your starting point is to say, "Hey look, I want to be equipped more for works

729
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
 of service.

730
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
 I realize I've become stagnant.

731
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,600
 I realize that I basically just live my faith on a Sunday and I don't live my faith much

732
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
 outwards.

733
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,040
 I realize that God has gifted me, but I'm not really using those gifts."

734
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,640
 And you're thinking, "I want to actually think about what it means for me to serve the city

735
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,000
 of Hong Kong, to serve my bank, to serve that law firm, that educational institution, whatever

736
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,840
 it might be, serve my family.

737
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,720
 I want to learn more about that.

738
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,840
 That's my starting point."

739
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,760
 Or maybe for some of you it's this faith in the knowledge.

740
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,200
 "I want to get that balance better in my life.

741
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,680
 I've got a little bit too much of the experience I feel like I'm lacking."

742
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,760
 Or, "I feel like I've got too much of this, but I want to learn what are the gifts of

743
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
 the Spirit like.

744
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,520
 I want to have somebody pray for me to receive some of the gifts.

745
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,600
 I want to do more of that."

746
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,360
 And so, maybe it's like you want to get that balance of faith and knowledge better in your

747
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
 life.

748
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,760
 I don't know what it is for you, but my challenge is if this is your church, this is what we're

749
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,880
 about.

750
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,320
 And I said this at the Unite for Faith.

751
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,120
 I want to say this again, and I'm saying it to you at the two as well.

752
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,000
 And I'm not joking this.

753
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 This is everything that the Vine is about.

754
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,720
 So if this doesn't excite you, or if this is not what you want, I totally respect that.

755
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,840
 And I would say, "Go check out some other churches."

756
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,600
 And I mean that because this is who we are.

757
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,640
 And this is what we're going to pour our time and energy and leadership into.

758
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
 This is what...

759
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,000
 And if you align with this, every Sunday when you come in, my heart and my prayer is that

760
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,400
 you'll feel like you're growing.

761
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,720
 You'll feel like you're maturing.

762
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,040
 You'll feel like you're being challenged.

763
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,120
 You'll feel like the truth is being spoken in love.

764
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,120
 You'll feel all of those things, and that will help you to grow.

765
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,040
 And if you align with that, then the starting point is your question today.

766
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,960
 How am I starting in that journey?

767
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,880
 And I pray that this excites you as much as it excites me.

768
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,840
 And this is what's going to continue to be at the forefront of us as we hold forth and

769
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,360
 fast to the Word of God amongst us.

770
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
 Amen?

771
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,360
 Can I pray for us?

772
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:50,040
 Why don't you stand with me, and I'll pray for you.

773
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,160
 I hope people come back next week, though.

774
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,320
 I did kind of mean that, but hopefully you resonate with what we're talking about.

775
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,000
 Things you regret later.

776
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Okay.

777
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 Father, we just are so grateful that we are here together.

778
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,480
 And I wonder if this is resonating with you.

779
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,480
 This is your home church.

780
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,800
 Can I just encourage you to just put your hands out as I pray, and I want to just commission

781
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,480
 you into the things that we're talking about.

782
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,360
 And if you're visiting from another church or somewhere else, you can receive, of course,

783
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,360
 receive this as well for whatever context Christ has planted you into.

784
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:32,200
 So as your hands are open, Father, we thank you that you called the vine to grow big people.

785
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,800
 Thank you, Lord, that each person here represents a wonderful, created human being that you

786
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,520
 love so much, that the image of God is placed within, and that you're wanting to see flourish.

787
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:51,360
 Father, I thank you that we have amazing doctors and nurses and teachers and educational professors.

788
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,660
 We have entrepreneurs.

789
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,840
 We have people in politicians, people in the government, police.

790
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,800
 Lord, we have all aspects of societies represented across our services.

791
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,440
 Lord, that is such a beautiful thing.

792
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,920
 Thank you.

793
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,000
 Thank you, Lord, that you've blessed this community with variety and diversity.

794
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,240
 Lord, I want to pray that there will be a unity felt amongst us as you build us up for

795
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,640
 works of service.

796
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,320
 Lord, I want to pray for each person here who's saying the vine is their home church.

797
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,480
 I want to pray that this starting point that you're putting on their spirit right now would

798
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,600
 be their next step in deepening their journey with us as a community of faith, but more

799
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,160
 than that, deepening their own journey in relationship with you, Lord.

800
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,800
 I pray that we as a church will be able to serve that next step as best as we can, knowing

801
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,480
 that we won't always get it right and that we'll make mistakes along the way.

802
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,640
 Lord, I pray that more than that, the people of this room would love each other, would

803
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:53,200
 love and encourage and cheer each other on deeply in the spirits of influence and the

804
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,120
 works of service that they are doing.

805
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,040
 Lord, I want to pray that there would be such unity at the vine between experience of you,

806
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,440
 the heart and the faith and the works of the spirit and the power that there is in the

807
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,160
 spirit as well as the depth of your word and the roots of doctrine and good theology.

808
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,760
 And Lord, I pray that those two things would come together in a beautiful way, Lord, that

809
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,480
 we would find ourselves deeper in knowledge and in faith of the Son of God.

810
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,960
 And Lord, I pray for that whole measure, the whole measure of the whole measure of the

811
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,360
 whole measure of the fullness of Christ over each person.

812
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:37,160
 And so Lord, today as we respond in worship, Lord, I want to just pray, maybe just you

813
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,680
 take the time as we worship now to think about what is my next step?

814
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,000
 What is my starting point?

815
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,200
 And maybe after the service you want to come forward and have someone pray for you.

816
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,760
 Maybe for some of you that's the foster care situation we were talking about earlier.

817
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,600
 You know, those next steps might be things that you're going to do, making room for God

818
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,880
 by serving the poor and the vulnerable, the marginalized of our city.

819
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,480
 Maybe some of you want to do that as a next step.

820
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,280
 It might be a lot of different things, but take the time to hear from the Holy Spirit.

821
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,680
 And if you'd like prayer, we're going to have a team that will pray for you at the end of

822
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,860
 the service around that as well.

823
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,920
 But as we respond, we do so asking Him to mature us and to grow us into big people.
