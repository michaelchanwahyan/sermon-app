[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Well, it's great to see everyone.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   And I want to start off, when I was in 2000, actually I don't know when it was, it was a long time ago, I don't even think it was 2000.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   When I was 15 years old, I had a friend that lived about two hours away.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And so I used to visit him on extended holidays with a train or sometimes he came and saw me.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   And on one occasion, I got on the train, I had a basketball magazine, this is before the times of like having your smartphone.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So I like, there was nothing to do, so I had a magazine.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I find a compartment where there's six seats in one compartment, that's how they used to have trains in Germany.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   So I sit down where there's nobody else, I'm like, this is awesome, I'm by myself.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   I start reading and then a guy comes in, a young man older than me, sits right across from me.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I'm like, why did he sit right across from me? There's all this space.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Come on.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And the first thing he says to me is, you're a Christian, aren't you?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I was like, what?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   He's like, no, you have to know, I've never have seen this guy before in my life.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I have no idea who he is.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   So in my mind, my wheels are turning.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I was like, what does this guy want from me?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   He doesn't introduce himself, he doesn't say hello.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   He starts off with, you're a Christian.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   What does he want?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Do I want to say that I'm a Christian?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   So I had a choice to make.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Am I going to step out in faith and say, yes, I'm a Christian, or am I going to remain in hiding?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Now, what you also don't know is I have just become a Christian.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   So I'm a new Christian, my baby Christian.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   So before this point, I had never publicly told anyone that I was a Christian, besides people in church.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   So I end up telling him, yes, I'm a Christian.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And we had an amazing conversation for the entire train ride, talking about faith, all sorts of things.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And as I was reflecting on that experience, I realized that God was calling me, through this guy's question, to a greater faith.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   That he was calling me to step out in faith and publicly declare, yes, I'm a Christian.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And what I also didn't know was that on that weekend, as I was heading to see my friend,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   it was important for me to have a clear identity of who I am, what I'm going to do, and what I'm not going to do.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So God worked through this encounter.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Now, God doesn't only just, or has not just done it in that specific circumstance.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Actually, part of our discipleship journey is that there is times where Jesus calls us to greater faith.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Maybe it's trusting him with a job search, and he's teaching you to trust him, that he can provide.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And he's asking you to trust yourself to him.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   For me, it was trusting to say I'm a Christian in this awkward situation, that this guy doesn't have some weird, bad agenda.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   But right now, as we're going through the Longing for Healing sermon series that we started last week,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I believe that the Holy Spirit wants to stir some faith among us.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   He's calling us to a deeper faith and a type of feeling that Jesus is powerful to do in our lives,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   that Jesus is powerful to do in your lives, and in this community's life.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Amen?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And so, Jesus calls us out of our comfort and routines to turn to him in faith to receive his restoring and healing work.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   He wants to break some of those comfort and some of that routine that we're right now living.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He's calling us to step out of that.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   So that's what we're going to be looking at today.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   But we're continuing in our message series, Longing for Healing.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   This is the second week.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   The thing that we're looking at is that Jesus is the one in whom there is help, healing, wholeness,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and he's the only one who can fully deliver that.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   He's the only one who has the power to do this work in our lives.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And so, as you look at the Gospels, and we're going to look at a story of an encounter between Jesus and a woman today.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And as you look at these encounters, a lot of times people come with the obvious need to Jesus,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   the one that's very visible. A lot of times that's a physical need.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And so they bring their physical need to Jesus, and Jesus heals the physical need.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   But he actually does a deeper healing.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Because we don't just need healing physically, we need healing spiritually, emotionally, mentally, socially.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And Jesus cares about all of who we are, our whole person.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And so my prayer for this series is that we will see and that we will experience that Jesus did not just heal back then,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   but he heals here today.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   That he has the power to bring restoration, healing, wholeness, where we're feeling broken,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   where we are carrying hurt, where we are carrying pain.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And not only does he want to do that in our lives,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   so he wants us to receive that, but he also wants us to be agents who bring healing to others.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Because one way that God works a lot of times is actually through loving community.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   That he brings healing to people's lives through other people who point others to Jesus,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   who show the love of Jesus, the grace of Jesus to people, and walk with people.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   So that's my prayer for this series, that we see how Jesus can bring healing into our life
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   in deeper and unexpected ways, and that we can also see that he calls us to be agents of healing in other people's lives.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So that we can pass this on to others.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So today we're in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Let me set the context for the story that we're going to look at.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So the story we're looking at, it's actually found in between another story.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   So there's a story that begins, then there's our story, and then that other story continues.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So Jairus, who was a leader in the synagogue, well-respected, honored man,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   his daughter is lying in bed and she is dying.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And so he has heard about Jesus, he goes to Jesus, he asks for Jesus to come to lay hands on his daughter,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   to heal her, to deliver her from this death.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And Jesus agrees, and he goes with Jesus.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And so they're on their way, they're walking to his house, and this is where our story interrupts that story.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So that's where we're going to pick up, we're in Mark chapter 5, verse 24b, and that's where we're going to start reading.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   "A large crowd followed and pressed around him, and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for 12 years.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors, and had spent all she had,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   yet instead of getting better, she grew worse.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   for she thought, 'If I touch his clothes, I will be healed.'
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   He turned around in the crowd and asked, 'Who touched my clothes?'
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   'You see the people crowding against you,' the disciples answered, 'and yet you ask who touched me?'
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Then a woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet, and trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   He said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.'"
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Now at the beginning of this story, we learn about the specifics of this woman's prolonged suffering.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   This has been going on for a very long time. Twelve years we're told.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   She is experiencing bleeding. It's not the normal menstrual bleeding. It's a uterine bleeding.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It's just ongoing. It's a medical condition.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It's causing her a lot of pain, a lot of shame.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   But we also have to know the cultural context that she's having this medical condition in.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Because during that time, if you had uterine bleeding, you would be considered as an unclean person.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   So they have this concept of clean and unclean. And she would be considered unclean.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   What that means is if she touches anyone, if she sits down anywhere, then there needs to be cleansing.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   The person needs to wash their clothes. They need to bathe themselves.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And so not only is she experiencing this physical pain, but she's also experiencing social and emotional pain.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Because she's really cut off from normal human relationships.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   So this has an incredible impact on her.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   She's also not able to go to the temple. She's not able to go into the synagogue.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So she's also cut off from the spiritual life and community.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And on top of that, to add pain to pain, she most likely is not able to marry.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And because of her medical condition, also not able to have children.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   So we can see these are just layers of suffering.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   But then we're also told that she suffered a great deal under many doctors.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   As I was reading this, I'm familiar with this passage, but this had never stood out to me before.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   She suffered a great deal under many doctors.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And I just wonder, what treatments did they take her through?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Was it humiliating? Was it traumatizing? Was it painful?
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Were there just expectations where every time she had hope that she would be healed, and then it was just crushed?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And we're told that she spent all her money.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   So this used to be a woman of means, but she lost all her money.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   So she's also on top of it, living in poverty.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And that with all the medical treatment, she actually just got worse.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   But the one thing that we do see in her is that there is this longing, just this desire to be healed, to be well.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And she has done everything that she knows how to do, but nothing has worked.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Now, the reason why I wanted to slow down, a lot of times you can read past this suffering quickly, and almost not notice it or feel it.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   But I wanted us to see it, to actually see this woman, to not just brush past her.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Now, I also know that some of us here have actually been carrying pain and suffering for a very long time.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Maybe it's also been multiple years.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And I just want to say that I'm so thankful and grateful that you're here, and that we love you.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And that my hope is that in this community, you can find friendship, you can find support,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   and you also can encounter the healing and the loving presence of Jesus.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   That's my heart.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So God's Word tells us that even as Christians, we will experience suffering in this world.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   This is part of human experience.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Suffering, pain, and death, they're not God's will for life.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   That's not what we were created for. But they are unavoidable aspects of this world in its broken condition.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Last week we looked at creation, fall, redemption, new creation.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   We looked at how the sin fall impacted every aspect of our lives, and brought damage to every aspect of our lives.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   So this is part of living in a fallen world.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   So we don't have to feel surprised if we experience suffering and pain.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   At one point or another, most of us experience this, if we're just honest.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And it also doesn't mean that God is specifically trying to target you with what's happening.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   That He's somewhat angry with you.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   So this is the reality of living in a broken world.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   God's Word, one thing that it does to you is it encourages us to bring a brokenness and our pain to Jesus, who is healer, who is Savior.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Now we don't always understand why in one instance a person is healed, and in another instance a person is not healed.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   We don't understand why healing sometimes is a process, and sometimes it's instantaneous.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   I met a person that used to be addicted to heroin and strong drugs, and he had an instantaneous healing.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Jesus delivered him from those drugs. Amazing.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   But then there are others where it's struggles and it's therapy and a long time of getting out of it.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   We don't always understand why things work that way.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   What we do know is that through Jesus' death and resurrection, heaven has come down.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   The kingdom of God has broken into this world.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And now through Jesus, healing, restoration, hope, help, love is available in Him.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   I'm actually going to quote Pastor Chapman from last week's Cantonese service.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Now, I did not understand what he said, but I do get to read the script in English.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   So he said this. I thought he said it perfectly.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   When we see healing, we see the already of the kingdom of God.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And when we haven't seen healing, we see the not yet.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   But even if healing doesn't happen now, it will always happen when the kingdom of God is fully realized.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Now, that's the biblical sort of background to our whole longing for healing conversation.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   But the one thing that scripture does make very clear in our passage today,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   it makes very clear that we are called to bring our brokenness, that we're called to bring our pain to Jesus.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Because He is powerful. He is able to heal. He is able to restore.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And so we can't control these other things.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And we don't understand them. And there's some mystery to that.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   But we know what we can do. And that's come to Jesus.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   And that's what we're encouraged to do, to bring ourselves to Him.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   And unlike those doctors that the woman went to, we never leave Jesus feeling more broken.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Where we always, after encountering Jesus, we feel His love, His loving presence. We feel better.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And He does not put us to shame when we turn to Him.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   He does not put us to shame when we come to Him with our mess.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Sometimes our sinfulness, our brokenness.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   But let's continue looking at the scripture.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   So in verse 27 we're told that the bleeding woman, that she heard about Jesus.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   So words have been spreading about Jesus that in Him there is healing.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   So it stirs in her heart and it raises hope inside of her.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And so in her mind she thinks, "If I can only touch His cloak, if I can only touch His clothes, I'm going to be healed."
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   So she sneaks up behind Jesus, touches His clothes, and we're told in verse 29 that immediately her bleeding stopped.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   And she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   It's amazing. Praise Jesus. Absolutely incredible healing.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Now, why did she sneak up on Jesus?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Earlier, Jairus, actually he goes publicly to Jesus. He doesn't have to sneak up to her.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Why does she have to sneak up to Jesus, or feels like she has to sneak up to Jesus?
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Well, it has to do with what I explained earlier, because she feels unclean.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Or that's what society tells her. Society tells you you're a walking contamination.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   She feels unworthy.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And she doesn't feel like she can come just face to face with Jesus.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   She does the only thing that she knows how to do, and just comes to Him from behind, touches His clothes.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   And I just wonder if there are some of us who can relate to how this woman felt about herself and about coming to Jesus.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   I know I have felt that way in the past.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I remember I really used to resonate with the lyrics from a song, "I'm too messed up for love."
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   I'm going to try to write a whole, it's like a rap.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   It's like, "Will you take me as I am? I know the way that I'm living is wrong, but I can change on my own trying to make it along.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   I wonder how could you love me with my life so ugly that you laid down your life for me?"
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   You know, that's how I felt. I felt that my life was so ugly.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And I knew it, because it was full of sin and brokenness.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   And so I was ashamed.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   But let's continue verse 30, and I'll read 30 through 32.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   "At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from Him.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   He turned around in the crowd and asked, 'Who touched my clothes?'
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   'You see the people crowding against you,' the disciples answered.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   'And yet you can ask who touched me?'
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it."
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Now, I just picture Jesus on the NPR.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Anyone with me? Rush hour, somewhere around Admiralty, or one of those points where there's so much going on.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Everybody's pushing against you on every side.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Everybody's clothes are touching with other people's clothes.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And then Jesus says, "Who touched my clothes?"
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   The disciples, "What are you talking about? Everybody's touching everyone's clothes."
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   But what they didn't know is that Jesus had felt a power going out from Him.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And so He continues to look around, and He's not swayed by the disciples to stop.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Now, let me ask this question.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Why does Jesus continue to look for the person who has touched Him?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Why not just wink at the woman, "I know what you did. It's okay, and I'm just going to let you go in peace."
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Why did He do that?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Why didn't Jesus--she already has been carrying so much shame.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Why make her step out from the crowd?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Well, let me explain.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Now, the woman, she did receive physical healing.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   When she touched His clothes.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   That was amazing.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   But it was actually her shame that made her just sneak up on Jesus.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And it was also her shame that was now at work in her heart as Jesus is asking, "Who touched me?"
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And obviously this must have taken a while because the way it's described in Scripture,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   she didn't just jump out immediately.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   There was some delay.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And so she's still carrying this shame in her heart.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   And it almost keeps her from stepping out into the presence of Jesus, into the face-to-face with Jesus.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Now, Brene Brown, some of you know her.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   She's a well-known author, a professor, researcher, especially on the topic around shame.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   She defines shame this way.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   "Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   and therefore unworthy of love and belonging."
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   So the woman, she had internalized society's messages about herself.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Unclean. Unworthy. Dishonored.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   She was carrying shame.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Now, a while ago, I moved back to California.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   So I'm moving back and forth between different countries.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And I had to go to the Department of Motor Vehicle, which is known in California as DMV.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Now, in other parts of the U.S., you go to DMV, you're served right away.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   You're in, you're out.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   And California is notorious for these eternal lines where you go in and you want service,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   and it takes three, four hours.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   You're just standing there.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   So I needed to renew my driver's license because my license had expired like forever ago.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   So I'm standing in line.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   I don't know. It's probably already an hour and a half.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   And then this person, this man who is experiencing homelessness, he comes up to me.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   He needs a government ID.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   He asked me if I can help him fill out a form because he just couldn't do it.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   His body through living on the streets was so impacted, he wasn't able to do that anymore.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   So I was like, "Sure, I'd be happy to help."
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   So I fill out the form. I work with him.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   We get to the part about organ donation.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   So I asked him, "Do you want to be an organ donor?"
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   He says, "Me? I'm filth.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Who would want my organs?"
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   That just broke my heart that he saw himself as filth, that that's how he understood himself.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Yes, he most likely was drinking, using drugs, all of those things.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   But we know that every single person is created in the image of God,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   that every single person is lovable, beautiful creation from God.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   And so we're not filth.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   But that's what society told him that he was in his experience of being homeless.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Now that reminds me of the woman when I read the story,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   that she had internalized these messages that she was unclean, unworthy, unlovable.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   That then became her identity.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   That's who she thought she was.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   And her shame was a real barrier that was standing between her and Jesus.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   And her shame almost kept her from receiving what Jesus wanted to do in her life.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Because he didn't just want to heal her physically.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   There was more work to be done.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And so Jesus calls her out.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   He doesn't let it go.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   He wants her to step forward.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   He wants her to take a step of faith.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And then she steps forward, trembling with fear.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   There's courage.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   There's vulnerability.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Verse 33 describes it, says this,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   "Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   trembling with fear, told him the whole truth."
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   So that means she stepped into the presence, the loving presence of Jesus.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Instead of sneaking up on him,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   and an impersonal encounter with him,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   she now is having a personal encounter with Jesus.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And she tells him the whole truth.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   So we're not told exactly what that all entails,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   but at the very least, this entails her desiring and longing for healing
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   and touching his clothes,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   and in her, experience miraculous physical healing.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And when you read about trembling with fear,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   now this can be for many reasons.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Maybe she was trembling with fear because of the whole clean, unclean thing,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   and she touched him, and thereby defiled him.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   She was like, "Maybe Jesus is going to get angry with me."
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Then I touched him.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Once he finds out.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Or perhaps she thought maybe she stole some power from Jesus
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   because her understanding of how Jesus works is probably--
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   it's actually informed more by superstitions and beliefs of the time,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   that holy men, when they had clothes,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   when you touch them, there's healing power in the clothes.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   So she may have thought that, "Oh, I stole power illegitimately of Jesus,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   and he's going to be angry."
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   And then finally, another reason is that she had experienced healing,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   and it raises the question, "Who is Jesus?"
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Because none of those doctors could heal me, but Jesus healed me.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   And so it's like dawning on her, "Could it be that Jesus is God with us?"
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   And so she's trembling and stepping in front of Jesus.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Now, she does not know how Jesus is going to respond.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   We know because I read the story earlier, or you might know the story.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   But she does not know.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And here's how Jesus responds.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   So Jesus is not angry with her touching him.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Actually, that never made him angry because he can make people clean.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   He can restore people.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   That never bothered Jesus.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   That bothered other people.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And through his actions, he's telling her, "You are worthy.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   You're worthy of my time.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   You're worthy of my attention.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   You're worthy of me stopping in the middle of heading to this very important person
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   who is very wealthy, who has all the honor.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   You're worthy for me to stop and to give you all of my attention,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   to not let go of this moment, of this greater thing that I want to do in your life."
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And so he speaks these incredible words over her.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   "Daughter, my daughter."
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And so he's restoring her broken identity.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   She was having self-talk that said, "I'm unclean.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   I'm unworthy."
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   But Jesus says, "You're worthy.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   You're my daughter."
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   But that also means, "You are part of my family.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   You are part of the family of God."
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   That's what Jesus says.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   "You belong.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   I love you."
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   He also tells her that it is her faith that has healed her.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   So he corrects her mysterious understanding of a faith and how God works through that.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   So to answer the question, "Why did Jesus insist that she steps out?"
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Well, it's because he loves her too much to just let her walk away.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   He loves her too much to just let her have this impersonal encounter with Jesus
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   and then to slip out.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   He wants her to know that she is lovable, that she is worthy.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   He wants to restore.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   He wants to bring healing where there's been emotional pain and shame
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   that she's been carrying.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   So he does this beautiful healing, restoring work in her life.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Not only that, now instead of leaving not knowing and maybe even having all these questions
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   and leaving with her emotional pain, with her social pain,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   now she is part of Jesus' family, daughter.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   She's part of the family of God.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   She's leaving with a personal relationship with Jesus from this encounter.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And that's where true and full healing is found,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   is in that personal relationship with Jesus.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Because when we step into that relationship every time,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   it's the loving and healing presence of Jesus that wants to meet us.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Now, where does that leave us?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Jesus is not afraid of your pain.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   He's not afraid of your brokenness.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   He's not afraid of your sin.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   He's not afraid of your shame that you might be carrying.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   He just welcomes us to come to Him with whatever has happened in our lives,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   whatever you have done, and to open our heart to Him.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   And He calls us forth like He called forth the woman to faith, to greater faith,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   because He wants you to experience His healing, His power in your life.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   He wants you to experience His emotional healing, social healing, forgiveness from sins,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   whatever it is, physical healing.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   He calls you, calls me to step forward in faith.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Now, a professor of mine, he says this, "Faith opens the door to the power of God."
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   So when the woman decided that she believes that Jesus somehow can heal her,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   and she didn't fully understand even who He was, she didn't have a clear picture,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   but her faith was erected towards Him.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   And it was God worked through her faith.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Faith opens the door of the power of God in our lives.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   So when we come to Jesus with faith, it opens the door of the power of God in our lives
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   that brings healing and restoration.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   So how much faith do you have to have?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Do you have to have super faith, a little bit medium faith?
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   It sounds like a steak.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   A little faith?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Or what, very well?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   No, all it takes is just faith that's enough to come to Jesus.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   It's not about your amazing and incredible faith.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   All you need is just to turn to Jesus and say, "Jesus, help!
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Help, Jesus!
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   I need you!
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   I need you to work in this area of my life.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Help, Jesus!"
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Now, I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I guess that was a surprise.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Jesus wants to heal our emotional, our social pain.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   What is some of the shame and pain that you have been carrying around?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   What are some of the messages that you have internalized?
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Just like the woman had internalized, "I'm unclean, I'm unworthy."
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Like the person that was experiencing homelessness had internalized, "I'm filth."
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   What are some messages that you have internalized about yourself?
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   The self-talk, how you see yourself, but not how God sees you.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Is it, "I'm a bad son. I'm a bad daughter.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I'm a horrible parent. I'm unlovable.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   I'm just the greatest sinner."
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   And Jesus, He's calling us right now to step forth in faith
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   and just bring these things to Him.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Bring these pains to Him that we have been calling ourselves,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   that we have been naming ourselves with.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Because He wants to do His restoring and healing work.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   He wants to bring His peace, His shalom to bear on our lives.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   So what I want to do right now is I want to invite you actually to take a step of faith.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   And whatever it is that's going on in your lives,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   maybe there is emotional pain, maybe there is shame,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   maybe you feel isolated, socially cut off,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   maybe there is physical pain, I don't know.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Whatever it is, I want to encourage you to bring that to Jesus
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   and say, "Help, Jesus, I need you."
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Just to turn to Him.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   And the way I want to encourage you to do it is actually just to stretch out your hand before you,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   just as a sign, "Jesus, I just long for a deeper healing.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   I have an ache, I have a pain in my heart, and I just long to be well.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   I'm just not feeling well.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And I know it's only you who is able to do that."
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   So I want to encourage you to do that right now.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And just start that conversation with Jesus.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   So we're going to have some space to just talk to Him.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   No one left a doctor worse than when we come to Jesus, we never leave worse.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   We always leave better when we step into the loving and the healing presence of Jesus.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   And Jesus, right now, He's speaking over our lives.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   He's saying, "Daughter, my son, my child, your faith has healed you.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Go in peace.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Be freed from your suffering."
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Jesus wants and is bringing deliverance from Satan's lies about you.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Things that Satan wants you to believe, wants me to believe.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And He wants to break the power of those lies over your life.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   And just replace it with the truth, "You are my beloved.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   You are worthy of my time.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   You are worthy of my attention.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   You are worthy."
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Let me pray over you.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Jesus, you know every one of our lives.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   You know every one of our stories.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   You know all the things about us.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   And yet you choose to love us.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   And you hear right now the prayers that are being spoken of just pain and shame
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   that we've been carrying for too long.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   And Holy Spirit, will you do the healing, the restoring, the renewing work right now.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Will you pour out your spirit on people.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Will you fill your sons, your daughters, your children with your spirit,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   with your loving presence, with words spoken over their lives that they need to hear.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   And will you release your healing.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Jesus, will you release your healing over us right now.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Like you did in this woman's life.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Will you bring holistic healing.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Will you bring healing to our emotional pain, our physical pain, our social pain, our mental pain.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   That you are powerful, that you are able, and that as we heard earlier, you are limitless.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   So we thank you for your healing and restoring work right now.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   In your name, Jesus. Amen.
