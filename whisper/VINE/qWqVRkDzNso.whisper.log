[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]   - Thank you, Tim, thank you.
[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.960]   So I have been to church for a long time
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.400]   since I was really young.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.960]   And because of that, a lot of the aunties and uncles
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.200]   in the church would ask me,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.120]   "Jun, go and share your testimony with the younger ones."
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.680]   And every time I hear that, I get really nervous
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.280]   because I don't have a really good story to tell.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.000]   I'm a second generation Christian.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.480]   Well, actually a third, 'cause my grandma was a Christian.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.080]   So I've always grown up knowing God is real.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.360]   I've always known, you know, He is here in my life.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.560]   So when I, I don't have any exciting things to tell.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.880]   And also when I wanna talk about...
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.240]   Away. (laughs)
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.160]   So exactly, like sometimes I get really nervous
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.120]   about talking to people and sharing about my story,
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.280]   and there's just not much to say, right?
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.960]   Maybe you need to help me fix it.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.800]   (audience laughs)
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.640]   - Hi.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.480]   (audience cheers)
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.720]   - Thank you so much.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.440]   So I have nothing, really a lot going on in my life to share
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.120]   until my mom started baking bread, right?
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.360]   So she doesn't just bake her bread
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240]   in those baking bread machines.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.840]   She would grow her yeast.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.040]   She would knead the bread by hand,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.240]   and then she would prove it for a really long time.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.400]   She normally started it in the afternoon.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.520]   And normally it takes the whole day to do it.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.280]   And so by nighttime, at 11 o'clock nighttime,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.840]   the whole house is filled with the bread aromas.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.760]   And she'll go, "Joon, would you like to taste my bread?"
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.680]   And I go, "Mom, I'm full already.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.120]   "I just had dinner not too long ago."
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.320]   And she would be a little bit upset.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.920]   And she go, "Not even a bite of your mom's bread."
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.040]   I go, "Okay, okay, let me taste it."
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.600]   So I would taste it.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.480]   And she'll ask me, "Is it good?"
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.640]   "Yeah, it's good."
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.240]   And she would always have this follow-up question
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.760]   to ask me, "Why is it good?
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.000]   "Why do you like it?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.200]   "How do you compare it with store-bought bread?"
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.280]   And so now, as I'm like a few years later,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.960]   I'm very good at describing the textures and the taste
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.040]   and all the different combinations of bread.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.000]   And then I thought, "Wow, not only I'm able to articulate it,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.200]   "what I say can be a proof for my mom to say
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.080]   "that, yes, my bread is good because my daughter said this,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.760]   "because this is exactly what she tasted."
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.080]   And so fast forward to now, when I realize that,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.480]   oh, when I have to articulate why something is good,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.360]   I can remember the details that I easily forgotten.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.600]   I could put the fleeting feelings into words
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.840]   to share with other people.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.000]   And testimony sharing is similar to that.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.320]   It is about sharing and celebrating
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.200]   what God has done in your life,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.520]   whether it is when you first believe
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.160]   or when you're just experiencing God's presence in your life
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.040]   and the changes that He has in your life.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   So stepping into 2025, think about 2024.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.640]   Has it been a really quick year for you?
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.880]   Or has this year been a little bit long and dragging
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.160]   and you're wishing that 2025 could come sooner?
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.080]   Have you noticed anything that you've changed for yourself?
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.800]   And how has God been involved in your life?
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.280]   Today, we're going to look at Psalm 66
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.120]   and see how the Israelites have been reflecting
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120]   and praising God in their lives
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.680]   to inspire us how we could reflect on our own lives as well.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.480]   So let's look at Psalm 66, verse one to five first.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.200]   It says, "Shout for joy to God, all the earth.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.920]   "Sing about the glory of His name.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.200]   "Make His praise glorious.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.280]   "Say to God, 'How awesome are your deeds!
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.440]   "'Because of your great power,
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.160]   "'your enemies cringe before you.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.920]   "'All the earth bow down to you.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.840]   "'They sing praise to you.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.600]   "'They sing the praises of your name.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.760]   "'Come and see what God has done,
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.760]   "'His awesome deeds for mankind.'"
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.920]   Right from the start, the Psalmist gives very clear guidance
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.440]   on how to praise and what to praise.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.880]   So how should we praise?
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.240]   We need to sing, we need to shout,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.080]   we need to speak out God's praise.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.280]   But what do we share about?
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.000]   We will share about what He has done,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.600]   His power and His name.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.200]   He is the God of provision.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.000]   He is the Almighty God.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.680]   That is His name and that is His personality
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.480]   and character towards us.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.800]   In verse five, the Psalmist says directly,
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.360]   "Come and see what God has done."
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.320]   The English version is actually very closely translated
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.600]   to the Hebrew one because of the structure.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   They both begin with the verbs, "Come and see."
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.280]   It's not thought, like praise is not a thought
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.440]   that we could go, "Oh, you get me, God.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.440]   "You know why I praise you.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.080]   "I will just keep it in my heart."
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.840]   It's not like that at all.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.560]   The Psalmist actually is calling His community
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.400]   to come and see what God has done in their life.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.160]   It's so urgency.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.760]   Come quickly and see what God has done.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.920]   When we look back at what God has done in our lives,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.560]   we naturally want to tell other people to come and see it,
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.240]   to come and experience it for yourself.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.640]   So I had this really good experience like that as well.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.920]   So this month, the beginning of December,
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.720]   I found this really delicious yakitori place
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.400]   just next to my building.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.240]   And so with just this month, I had it five times
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.600]   'cause I kept telling my friend, my family,
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.040]   my old coworkers to, "You have to come and see the place
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.040]   "because the favorite thing I love about that place
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.600]   "is their eel skewers."
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.840]   Do you eat eel here?
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.920]   Who eats eel?
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.560]   Oh, there are some of you who like,
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.320]   "No, I'm not gonna try that."
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.440]   (laughs)
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.400]   Well, this eel is so good because the skin is very crispy.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.080]   And when you bite into it, the juice just burst out
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.160]   and the meat is just so bouncy and it's just so delicious.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.280]   And I kept telling people, "You have to come and see it."
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.520]   And so I had this five times.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.200]   And so this is exactly what my reflection is like.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.960]   I have to go home and think about,
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.720]   did I reflect about what God has been in my life like that?
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.160]   Have I savored it so much that I would want to share
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.440]   with other people as well?
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   And so then in verse five to seven and eight to 12,
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.200]   this is exactly what the Psalmist did.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.040]   He wants to testify God's goodness in two different angles.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.800]   The first one comes in verse five to seven.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.480]   It says, "Come and see what God has done,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.720]   "His awesome deeds for mankind.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.800]   "He turned the sea into dry land.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.440]   "They passed through the waters on foot.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.400]   "Come, let us rejoice in Him.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.160]   "He rules forever by His power.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.120]   "His eyes watch the nations.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.760]   "Let not the rebellious rise up against Him."
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.560]   The Psalmist give thanks for the identity
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.320]   God has given them.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.680]   So the Israelites before that, before they were a nation,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.240]   they actually had been slaves of the Egyptian slaves.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.680]   But God's action set them free
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.880]   and their identity changed to become God's people.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.560]   Even though the Psalmist never experienced God,
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.760]   you know, opening up the Red Sea for them
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   and he actually walked through the dry land,
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.480]   but this is the identity they refer to.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.080]   When you ask the Israelites, "Who are you?
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.280]   "Where do you come from?"
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.600]   The first thought that come into their mind
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.720]   is the way that God set the nations free
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.760]   and give them identity.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.120]   When we talk about identity nowadays,
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.680]   we would say that, "Oh, I am,"
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.920]   like if you asked me like a few years ago,
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.920]   I would say, "Oh, I am a teacher.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.600]   "I was someone else's daughter
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.720]   "and I belong to this and that place."
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.400]   But the first thing that Israelites,
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.520]   when they want to praise God,
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.280]   the first thing that come out of their mouth
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.720]   is the identity, the relationship they had with God.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.920]   God set me free.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.880]   God took me out from someplace, from slavery,
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.320]   into freedom, into God's people.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.560]   So when I ask you,
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.880]   if you have to ask yourself this question,
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.760]   what is your identity right now?
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.880]   Who do you belong to?
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.840]   What would you have said differently?
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.520]   Or what inspired you to think about that question?
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.880]   And so they ask people to come and see
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.200]   where they are at now.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.600]   I am now free.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.120]   I am now God's people.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.000]   So come and see.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.960]   It's not just to come and look at them,
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.920]   but to come and consider, come and think about this.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.760]   Do you see who I am now?
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.720]   I am God's people.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.120]   This can't be achieved by just mere human striving.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.840]   This has to be done by God's power.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.000]   And you just have to look and consider
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.120]   and think about where I am now.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.360]   And in verse eight to 12,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.320]   it talked about the hardship.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.200]   But looking back,
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.960]   they understood something deeper through the process.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.880]   So let's have a look at verse eight to 12.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.960]   Verse eight, it says,
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.000]   "Praise our God, all peoples.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.080]   "Let the sounds of his praise be heard.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.280]   "He has preserved our lives
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.200]   "and kept our feet from slipping.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.840]   "For you, God, tested us.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.320]   "You refined us like silver.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.200]   "You brought us into prison
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.480]   "and laid burdens on our backs.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.800]   "You let people ride over our heads.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.840]   "We went through fire and water,
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.840]   "but you brought us to a place of abundance."
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.760]   When we remember God's work during hardships,
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.920]   we can see things differently.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.160]   There are many explanations or why suffering happens.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.720]   Sometimes there are no explanation
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.880]   why there are sufferings as well.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.640]   But God is always working.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.800]   He's always at work.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.400]   When the psalmist remember that difficulty,
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.200]   they see a purpose behind it.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.360]   In verse 10, the psalmist says,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.680]   "God refines them like silver.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.440]   "Even though they were trapped and burdened,
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.080]   "even though they suffered,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   "they saw these as spiritual refinement."
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.720]   So how do you refine silver?
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.520]   How do you refine silver?
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.280]   Well, the first step is to heat up silver
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.960]   to really high temperature, as high as 1,000 degrees.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.880]   And then they put lead into it.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.560]   The lead attracts all the other impurities,
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.120]   all the other substances,
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.840]   and it actually weighted them down.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.120]   All the impurities will be weighted down
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.320]   until there's only silver left at the bottom.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.160]   But the craftsmen still need to watch over it.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   They still need to discern whether the silver
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.280]   is pure enough by seeing how it reflects.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.240]   And so this is until the silver is mirror-like.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.640]   And the psalmist says,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.360]   "God made them carry heavy burdens.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.240]   "God led them through different challenges.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.600]   "They went through fire and water,
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.320]   "but these were not the final destination.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.760]   "The purpose for all of that
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.000]   "is to bring them to a place of abundance.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.480]   "Jesus said, 'He came so we could have life
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.440]   "'and have it more abundantly.'"
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.000]   What does abundant life looks like?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.240]   What does it mean to have an abundant life?
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.520]   Here's something interesting.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.680]   When Jesus talks about abundance,
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.520]   He never once mentioned our possessions, not once.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.160]   He talks about peace that goes beyond understanding.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.840]   He talks about joy that persists even in hard times.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.320]   He talks about relationship that fills our hearts.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.200]   The process of getting an abundant life
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.000]   requires our hearts to keep up with our understanding.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.480]   Sometimes there are good things that happen
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.320]   and we rejoice it and we feel directly of God's love
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.560]   and God's mercy and gracious things on us.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.520]   Sometimes we have to go through difficult times
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.280]   to adjust our hearts so that we can be refined.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.880]   The process of getting an abundant life
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.240]   requires our hearts to keep up with our understanding.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.640]   When does a craftsman know that the silver is good enough?
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.560]   When it has high reflectivity and no impurities.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.560]   The craftsman have to watch over the silver's transformation.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.560]   They have to look at your transformation,
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.960]   the silver's transformation, and test its reflectivity.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.320]   Through difficulties, God refines us.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.360]   God constantly watches over my life
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.200]   so that it can better reflect His image.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.040]   And I'm thankful for our heavenly brother for doing that.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.000]   And today I've invited three friends to come up
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.680]   and share what God has been doing in their life.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.720]   And today they would like to tell you
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.320]   to come and see what God has done in their lives.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.520]   Not just to see what God is doing,
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.720]   but think about it and consider how things are done.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.320]   And so the first one I'd like to invite Francesca.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.720]   Let's give her a warm welcome.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.040]   (audience applauding)
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.200]   So we've always known Francesca.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.560]   She is service leading, she's in the coffee team,
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.600]   she's in many different, different roles.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.200]   But today she's gonna share about
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.560]   what God has been doing in her life.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.640]   So I'm gonna give the time to Francesca.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.480]   - Thank you.
