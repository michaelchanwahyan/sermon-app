1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
 Well, good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,880
 Thank you so much for joining us here today.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,040
 2020 is coming to an end.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,440
 Can I hear an amen?

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,040
 And some of you are saying, finally.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,400
 It was about time.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,560
 Hey, to start things off in a bit of a lighter way,

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,160
 I want to do a review that I call Remember When.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,040
 Now, remember when the pandemic first hit

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,480
 and we became experts on sourcing masks?

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,640
 Now, I want to share with you about my moment of glory.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,000
 I feel really good about this.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,920
 I was at a friend's New Year's party,

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,280
 and word came out that HKTV Mall was

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
 going to be selling some masks.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,040
 And so we all got online on our phones,

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,620
 and we got ready to the strike.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,600
 And when those masks became available,

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,780
 I managed to secure 90.

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,780
 And I was so excited.

21
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,580
 I felt like I finally arrived in Hong Kong.

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,740
 I know how to take care of stuff here.

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,580
 You know, that's not that easy.

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,260
 But then I also realized that I actually

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,820
 had an oven sitting in my HKTV Mall cart

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,220
 that I not only bought masks, but I also bought an oven.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,480
 So I got masks and an oven.

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,460
 But hey, you know, in the pandemic,

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,780
 that wasn't that bad of a thing.

30
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,140
 But I just was not as cool as I thought I was.

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,500
 Now, we managed to source masks from all over the world.

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,260
 You know, some of us on our own.

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,860
 Hong Kong people are really resourceful.

34
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,540
 They know how to get stuff.

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,820
 Some of us collaborated with friends, family, co-workers,

36
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,500
 and they sent us masks here, only for us

37
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,260
 to send them back to them as the pandemic spread

38
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,580
 and when they needed masks and didn't have them.

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,620
 Remember when we could go on vacations

40
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,900
 and didn't have to quarantine?

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,100
 Yeah, me neither.

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,820
 Man, I miss traveling.

43
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,980
 You know, that's one of the things I was really excited

44
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,220
 about coming back to Asia was the travel.

45
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,540
 Remember when we became Zoom experts?

46
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,740
 We're like, hey, virus, we're going to bypass you.

47
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,700
 You have nothing on us.

48
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,380
 We're going to go digital online.

49
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,900
 And so we learned about things like a virtual background,

50
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,020
 which works for some of us.

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,620
 We have good enough computers and chips

52
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,580
 in our computer.

53
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,340
 For others, not so much.

54
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,260
 We learned about Zoom fatigue.

55
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,740
 Anyone experience Zoom fatigue?

56
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,100
 Hey, you can put a comment in the feed

57
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,380
 if you know what Zoom fatigue's like.

58
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,140
 I certainly have experienced that.

59
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,900
 But we also learned about Zoom etiquette.

60
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,860
 Well, that's at least some of us.

61
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,900
 There's always that one person on the call

62
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,420
 who does not mute themselves.

63
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,300
 Hit the mute button.

64
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,900
 Come on, you can do it.

65
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,300
 Hey, remember when-- and by the way,

66
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,860
 this is the height of my review right here.

67
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,180
 This is the zenith, the pinnacle.

68
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,900
 You know what I want to share with you?

69
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,740
 Remember when we were scared of running--

70
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,860
 you guessed it-- out of toilet paper,

71
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,620
 and we got in touch with our inner hoarder,

72
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,820
 that little man, that little woman living inside of us?

73
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,860
 And we went into the stores and into drugstores,

74
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,780
 and we grabbed as much toilet paper and tissue

75
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,380
 as we could to make sure that we're secure.

76
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,740
 Now, a neighbor from me, him and I,

77
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,140
 we can look into each other's windows.

78
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,060
 You know, we pretend like we don't see each other, but we do.

79
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,860
 And so during that time, he had like stashes and stashes

80
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,540
 of like toilet paper and tissue there.

81
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,820
 And I started feeling insecure about what I had.

82
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,660
 But he was like, that's not cool, man.

83
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,420
 Why you got to take all the toilet paper?

84
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,060
 But remember also when we actually slowed down,

85
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,380
 and we took time with God, reading his word,

86
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,580
 spending time in prayer, experiencing him speaking to us.

87
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,020
 Remember when we got to spend a lot of time at home,

88
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,740
 work from home, and even though there's challenges in that,

89
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:29,100
 but nonetheless, we got to experience these precious moments

90
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,460
 with people that we love, with our parents,

91
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,260
 with our children, with our spouses, with our friends.

92
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,780
 Remember when we called each other,

93
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,220
 and we actually checked in to make sure the other person was okay.

94
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,980
 And we went out on the streets, and we handed out hand sanitizer.

95
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,860
 We handed out masks for those who couldn't afford them

96
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,780
 or wasn't able to source them for themselves.

97
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,140
 Hey, what's your highlight of 2020?

98
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,460
 Let us know about it.

99
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,180
 Put it in the comment.

100
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,060
 We would love to hear your highlight.

101
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:13,700
 Love to celebrate with you the good things that God has done this year.

102
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,100
 But even though a lot of good things happened,

103
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,180
 and they certainly have, and praise God for them,

104
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:27,340
 2020 has brought so many of us to our breaking points.

105
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,900
 And to one degree or another, we've experienced loss,

106
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,300
 we've experienced pain, exhaustion.

107
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,940
 Traveling has been difficult.

108
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,820
 Some of us have missed funerals, weddings of loved ones.

109
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,420
 I got married this year to my lovely wife, Chris.

110
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,980
 Woo-hoo!

111
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,580
 And we started with a civil union,

112
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,780
 which happened during the peak of the second wave.

113
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,740
 So we had to uninvite 30 people, which is awkward

114
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,540
 if you ever have to uninvite people to something.

115
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,180
 Not fun.

116
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,620
 Then we had our church wedding during the peak of the third wave,

117
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,620
 so we had to shift everyone from actually being here in person

118
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,220
 to now joining us online, and we had to delay our banquet.

119
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,300
 But by God's grace, we were able to have our banquet

120
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,740
 between the third and the fourth wave, and I'm really grateful for that.

121
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,460
 But this year has been tough.

122
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,020
 So many difficult things have happened.

123
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,300
 Some of us have lost loved ones.

124
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,900
 And if that's you, I just right now just want to send you the love

125
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,500
 from myself but also from the whole Vine family.

126
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,180
 We love you and we care deeply about what has been happening in your life,

127
00:06:49,180 --> 00:07:01,740
 and we just want to send you our love and hugs to you and to your family.

128
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,300
 Many other things have happened.

129
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,460
 You know, we've been scared of the virus.

130
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,820
 We've been living in fear.

131
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,260
 We've lost jobs.

132
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:19,700
 We had to postpone our college plans.

133
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,380
 Graduations were online instead of in person.

134
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,620
 Church everywhere online.

135
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,100
 Hey, thanks so much, you know, for joining us in this space,

136
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,620
 but we sure miss you here in person.

137
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,940
 But we're still glad we get to spend this time with you in this way.

138
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,220
 Parents became teachers at home, having to figure out how to navigate

139
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,740
 this whole working with their kids and collaborating with the class teachers

140
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,860
 and getting all the lessons done so that the kids don't fall behind.

141
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,940
 Friends have lost friends who've moved.

142
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,580
 So there's grieving people who have moved.

143
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,380
 And then there's a lot of uncertainty about the future.

144
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,740
 What's going to happen in 2021?

145
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,820
 Is there going to be a recession?

146
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:16,460
 Am I going to have my job or is the vaccine going to address all the issues?

147
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,860
 So I don't know what your 2020 has been like,

148
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,100
 but to one degree or another, we've all experienced pain and loss,

149
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,180
 and there's been challenges this year.

150
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,700
 And so as I was thinking about what do I want to share with you today,

151
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,460
 you know, what is God putting on my heart,

152
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,940
 this passage came to mind that has been with me throughout the whole year,

153
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,820
 that has come up multiple times.

154
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,980
 And that's a passage from the Gospel of Matthew,

155
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:53,380
 chapter 9, verse 35 through chapter 10, verse 5.

156
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,380
 And the reason why I want to choose this passage to share with you right now

157
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,580
 is because I believe that it's important for us to hear today,

158
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,860
 you know, that Jesus cares deeply about us,

159
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,140
 and he's aware of our circumstances.

160
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,060
 He's aware of what's going on in your life.

161
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,500
 But some of us were struggling to see that

162
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,220
 because this year has just blindsided us.

163
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,780
 It's been so difficult.

164
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,420
 And we don't feel like that Jesus is with us.

165
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,420
 We don't feel like that Jesus cares, but he does.

166
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:34,580
 And so in this message, I'm going to speak into the challenges of 2020,

167
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,940
 but I'm also going to be looking ahead

168
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:46,500
 and how Jesus invites us into very important work in 2021,

169
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,620
 the River Model Vision,

170
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,660
 you know, something that Pastor Andrew introduced two years ago in a Vision Sunday.

171
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,940
 And so we're going to see how Jesus wants to speak to us now here in our challenges,

172
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,300
 but we're also going to be looking ahead.

173
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,620
 So that's the plan for our time together.

174
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,620
 So let me start by reading this passage in Matthew, chapter 9, verse 35.

175
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,820
 And it says, "Jesus went through all the towns and villages,

176
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
 teaching in their synagogues,

177
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,380
 proclaiming the good news of the kingdom,

178
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,580
 and healing every disease and illness.

179
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,980
 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them,

180
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,580
 because they were harassed and helpless,

181
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,980
 like sheep without a shepherd."

182
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,660
 So first, we hear a summary of Jesus's ministry up until this point.

183
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,820
 He's been going from town to town.

184
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,460
 He's proclaiming the good news of the kingdom,

185
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,620
 but he's also demonstrating the kingdom by bringing healing

186
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,300
 and bringing wholeness to people.

187
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,140
 But then Matthew, he mentions a metaphor of sheep and shepherd

188
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:11,060
 in order to help us to understand how Jesus sees the crowd.

189
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,180
 That's actually a metaphor that Jesus himself uses elsewhere

190
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,740
 about himself, himself being the shepherd,

191
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,540
 but also Israel being the sheep.

192
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,060
 So for example, right after the passage that we're going to be looking at today,

193
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,580
 Jesus sends the disciples out to the lost sheep of Israel.

194
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,260
 So Israel are the lost sheep.

195
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,580
 And then in the Gospel of John, he calls himself,

196
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,620
 he says about himself, "I am the good shepherd."

197
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,900
 So not only did Jesus talk about this,

198
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,540
 but this was something that Jesus's contemporaries,

199
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,860
 they were familiar with.

200
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,540
 It was a metaphor they knew,

201
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,620
 because throughout the Bible,

202
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,620
 there's this metaphor of sheep and shepherd.

203
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,620
 Most of the time, it refers to sheep being Israel

204
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,420
 and shepherd actually being the leaders of Israel.

205
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:07,060
 And a lot of times, it's a critique of their lack of leading Israel.

206
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,860
 So Matthew, in our passage, he's using this metaphor

207
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,540
 to help us understand how Jesus sees the crowds

208
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,340
 and what's going on with them.

209
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,820
 And so as he's been walking around,

210
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,500
 he's been making these observations,

211
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,260
 and he sees that the people, they're without protection.

212
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,100
 They're vulnerable. They're harassed.

213
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,980
 They're helpless.

214
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,620
 They find themselves in a place of destitute.

215
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,700
 So during that time, there was Roman occupation.

216
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,500
 There was an oppressor that really turned up the screws

217
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
 or turned down the screws tight,

218
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,700
 you know, taking money.

219
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,660
 So a lot of people were struggling economically.

220
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,300
 But then also just not having the freedoms

221
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,660
 that the people desired to have.

222
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,420
 But then there was also things like spiritual oppression.

223
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:05,300
 And then just normal life, economic concerns, heartbreaks.

224
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,900
 And so what Jesus sees when he looks at the crowd of people

225
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:16,180
 is he sees people that are barely making it.

226
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,860
 That's what Jesus sees.

227
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:24,460
 And he sees their struggle, and he sees their pain.

228
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,020
 And he sees their lack of resources

229
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,220
 and their place of destitute

230
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,540
 and their need for somebody to come and lead them

231
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,380
 out of that place, to guide them.

232
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,500
 But it does not just stop there.

233
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,580
 Jesus not only sees and observes the struggles

234
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,660
 and the pain of the people.

235
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,100
 You know, that'd be like, just imagine that.

236
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,220
 Like he's like, "Oh, there's a lot of pain.

237
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,740
 Oh, well, that sucks."

238
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,660
 You know, and then he just moves on.

239
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,620
 But that's not what he does.

240
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,980
 We're told in verse 36 that Jesus had compassion on them.

241
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,580
 He allows himself to be deeply moved and touched

242
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,300
 by what's happening in people's lives.

243
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,820
 He cares deeply about every single person

244
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,260
 and what's going on in their lives.

245
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,980
 Every single person.

246
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,900
 Tim Keller, a well-known pastor from New York City,

247
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:33,500
 he says this, "Compassion means to get yourself involved

248
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,260
 and make yourself vulnerable."

249
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,060
 So it's two things.

250
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,500
 Get yourself involved, make yourself vulnerable.

251
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,900
 Well, Jesus, he made himself vulnerable.

252
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,180
 We just celebrated Christmas.

253
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,580
 It's all about Jesus making himself vulnerable

254
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,620
 and coming to us, coming into our lives to rescue us,

255
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,140
 but also to see and identify with our pain.

256
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,460
 And so he makes himself vulnerable.

257
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,020
 He allows himself to be impacted by that,

258
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,460
 but it does not stop there.

259
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,260
 He also gets involved.

260
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,780
 He gets involved in people's physical pain,

261
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,380
 and he heals them.

262
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,140
 He gets involved in people's emotional pain

263
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:27,180
 by taking away shame, restoring people's dignity,

264
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,620
 and comforting them,

265
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,860
 and telling them about their true identity.

266
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,300
 And he gets involved in people's spiritual pain,

267
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,100
 whether that's spiritual oppression or sinfulness

268
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,260
 that is just working havoc in our lives.

269
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,020
 And so he lays down his life

270
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,300
 and all those who place their trust in him

271
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,940
 can experience his deliverance

272
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,540
 and this newness of life that he gives.

273
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:02,140
 So Jesus is not a passive bystander.

274
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,420
 He gets involved, and this love and compassion

275
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,060
 that a lot of us and a lot of you

276
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,980
 that are watching here today have experienced,

277
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,900
 you know, it flows through Jesus

278
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,620
 because he deeply cares about every one of us.

279
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,660
 And Jesus, he sees your 2020,

280
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,060
 and he cares deeply about what you are going through.

281
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,100
 He's deeply touched and moved

282
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,180
 by what is going on in your life,

283
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,700
 and he wants you to know that today

284
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,660
 because we need to hear that.

285
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,740
 Because just like those people back there,

286
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,860
 there's a lot of us barely hanging on.

287
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,940
 You know, we're barely making it.

288
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,420
 And we need to hear this word today

289
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:56,300
 that Jesus, he knows, he sees, and he is involved.

290
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,900
 But there's a problem.

291
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,620
 When things don't turn out the way we hope for,

292
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,100
 or when we walk through a lot of painful experiences,

293
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,820
 we tend to withdraw from Jesus

294
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,860
 and we withhold our struggles from him.

295
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,220
 Now, in our Bible passage today,

296
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,940
 we see that even when we are in that place of withdrawal

297
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,540
 or pain or hurt, Jesus draws near to us.

298
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,700
 He has compassion for us.

299
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,140
 He cares about our struggles, your worry, your fear,

300
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,300
 your grief, your pain, your anger,

301
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,700
 your sadness, your frustration, your helplessness.

302
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,860
 He cares about you and he wants you to know that,

303
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,140
 and he wants you to know that right now.

304
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,300
 Jesus says about himself, "I am the good shepherd."

305
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,860
 And the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

306
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,140
 Jesus doesn't withhold anything from us, nothing.

307
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,020
 He has given everything for you, everything for me.

308
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,540
 He's not a bad shepherd.

309
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,780
 He's the good shepherd.

310
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,060
 Bad shepherds abandon their sheep.

311
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,140
 They leave them vulnerable and exposed,

312
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,780
 but that's not Jesus.

313
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,780
 Jesus doesn't leave you vulnerable and exposed.

314
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:28,020
 He's with you every step of the way.

315
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,100
 And he's also the one and the only one who is powerful

316
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,940
 and able to lead us to our destination.

317
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,380
 And so right now, I want to invite you to pour out your heart

318
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,140
 in prayer to him and to experience his comfort,

319
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:58,740
 his care, his healing presence as he meets you right now.

320
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,380
 So I want to encourage you at home.

321
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,700
 You know, it doesn't matter who's around you,

322
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,460
 even if you're on the go and watching this.

323
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,620
 I want to encourage you right now just to do some real talk

324
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,580
 with Jesus.

325
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,900
 Just tell him what you're feeling and what's going on.

326
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,780
 You know, even if you're barely struggling to do that,

327
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,860
 you know, that's actually a step of faith.

328
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,700
 And even if it's so hard, and when we do that,

329
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,100
 Jesus, you know, he reveals himself to us

330
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,140
 and we get to experience him working.

331
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,900
 So right now we're going to take like 20 seconds or so,

332
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,660
 and I just want to invite you to pray.

333
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,300
 So if you close your eyes with me right now,

334
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,660
 wherever you are, and just pour out your heart to Jesus.

335
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,340
 Jesus wants to meet you right now.

336
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,820
 He wants you to know that he is with you.

337
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,540
 He has not abandoned you.

338
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,860
 And he wants you to know his love,

339
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,780
 and he wants you to have hope.

340
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,300
 I'm with you.

341
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,060
 You're going to make it.

342
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,580
 I'm going to carry you through.

343
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,140
 So pour out your heart to him right now.

344
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:28,540
 (soft music)

345
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,380
 Jesus, you've heard right now all the prayers.

346
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,260
 Even if it was just like some stuttering or some,

347
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,460
 I'm in pain, some very simple words.

348
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,860
 And Jesus, I pray right now that your presence,

349
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,620
 wherever we are, that you would just fill that space

350
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,660
 with your presence, that you would make yourself known,

351
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,340
 that you would start the healing process,

352
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,300
 that you lift burdens off people,

353
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,540
 that we could feel that release that you can only bring.

354
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,180
 So Holy Spirit, I just pray that you would move

355
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,660
 powerfully right now.

356
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,340
 Lord, we desire that we pray for that,

357
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,940
 and we know you're able,

358
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,460
 and we know you are the good shepherd

359
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,460
 who doesn't abandon us, who is still with us,

360
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,820
 and who will see us through.

361
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,900
 So I pray that you would release faith, hope, and courage

362
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,620
 right now, in your name, Jesus.

363
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,460
 Amen.

364
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,260
 (soft music)

365
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:38,380
 Now, besides Jesus meeting us in this difficult space

366
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,980
 that a lot of us are finding ourselves in,

367
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,660
 and by the way, I do wanna encourage you

368
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,820
 to keep just pouring out your heart to Jesus

369
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,500
 and experiencing him meeting you.

370
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,860
 Even if you don't know him, you can talk to him,

371
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,820
 and he'll meet you, he'll make himself known to you.

372
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,620
 But besides Jesus showing us his compassion,

373
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:05,980
 I want us to think about what does Jesus see

374
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,420
 when he looks at Hong Kong in 2020?

375
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,340
 What does he see?

376
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,860
 What does Jesus want his church to see and do?

377
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,180
 And I believe that the river model vision

378
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,220
 that we as a church have been called to

379
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,580
 is about seeing our neighbors' circumstances

380
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,340
 and allowing ourselves to be filled with compassion

381
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:40,460
 for our neighbors, and to get involved in people's lives.

382
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:48,060
 Jesus wants his compassion in 2021 to flow through us

383
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,660
 to our neighbors, to the people here in the city

384
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,220
 that need his love, his compassion,

385
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,060
 that need to be touched,

386
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,260
 that need to know that there is a good shepherd.

387
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,860
 So as we step into 2021,

388
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,180
 we need to see our neighbors struggle.

389
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,980
 So as you have been looking around your neighborhood,

390
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,300
 what are you seeing?

391
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:19,220
 What is the spiritual, emotional, and physical condition

392
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,660
 of the people around you?

393
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,940
 Who is Jesus highlighting to you?

394
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:30,940
 Actually, I want to ask you to comment right now

395
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,420
 on the feed below.

396
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,740
 Let us know what has been Jesus highlighting to you.

397
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,780
 What are you seeing?

398
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,020
 What are you observing?

399
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:45,140
 Now, I believe that Jesus, he highlights specific people

400
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,140
 to us, that we are uniquely positioned

401
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,180
 to love, to serve, and to impact.

402
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,900
 So what are you seeing?

403
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,020
 What are you noticing?

404
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:05,260
 Do you see the elderly neighbor that's barely making it,

405
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,820
 who needs some help?

406
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:13,460
 Do you see asylum seekers,

407
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,460
 our brothers and sisters who are struggling,

408
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,940
 especially now even more so than before during COVID?

409
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,500
 Do you see people's spiritual condition?

410
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,860
 Maybe they have the financial resources

411
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,940
 and they're doing it from that perspective, fine,

412
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,580
 but they're just lacking that joy

413
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,980
 or that purpose in their lives.

414
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,820
 And you see that and it pains you.

415
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,260
 What is Jesus highlighting to you?

416
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,580
 Do you see the single parent

417
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,420
 that needs others to come around him or her

418
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,860
 and just walk with that parent?

419
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,780
 And with the child?

420
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,460
 You know, what do you see?

421
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,660
 Whom is Jesus highlighting to you?

422
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,380
 Where do you find yourself filled with compassion,

423
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,180
 deeply moved and stirred?

424
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,420
 Pay attention to that.

425
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,860
 Could it be that Jesus wants to work uniquely in that area

426
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,380
 that you see and where you are moved to compassion?

427
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,940
 What do you think?

428
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,340
 So as we make those observations about the people around us

429
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,700
 and we become aware of the needs,

430
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,420
 you know, there's usually two ways that we respond to that.

431
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,700
 One of them is, I just wanna get involved right away

432
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,980
 and I jump right into action.

433
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,900
 And a lot of times we burn out when we do that

434
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,540
 or it's just a short lift, you know,

435
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,500
 we do it for a little bit and then we move on.

436
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,380
 The other reaction, I think this is the,

437
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,540
 probably the more common one,

438
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,500
 is that we see our neighbors,

439
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,060
 we see their need,

440
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,180
 we start to understand the complexities

441
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,780
 of the issues that they're facing

442
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,500
 and we just get so overwhelmed.

443
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,340
 And we feel so small and we're like,

444
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,860
 I don't know what I can do or where to even start.

445
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,140
 And then even though we're moved,

446
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,380
 we don't know what to do with it

447
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,100
 and then after a while we just,

448
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,300
 in order to not have this cognitive dissonance,

449
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,100
 we set it on the back shelf

450
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
 and we just move on with our lives.

451
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,940
 And I think that's the way that Satan snatches away

452
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,460
 those things that he has, the Holy Spirit has sown

453
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,500
 and that he wants to move through us this year in 2021.

454
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,780
 But Jesus, he actually provides us some perspective on that

455
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,300
 and so I wanna share it with you,

456
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,460
 continuing in Matthew 9, verse 37, it says,

457
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,300
 then he said to his disciples,

458
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,580
 the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.

459
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,660
 Ask the Lord of the harvest,

460
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,700
 therefore to send out workers into the harvest field.

461
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,820
 And I love this here.

462
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,700
 Jesus acknowledges that the difficult reality,

463
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,020
 the harvest is plentiful, there's so much to do,

464
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,540
 but the workers are few.

465
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,860
 But he also tells us what to do

466
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,580
 and it's not what we tend to do,

467
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,460
 it's not jumping right into

468
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,940
 or disengaging and just feeling overwhelmed

469
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,580
 and not doing anything, it's neither of just two things.

470
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,580
 He tells us in this overwhelming need to start with prayer.

471
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:31,340
 And it's prayer that propels us forward

472
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,860
 in responding in a powerful way

473
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,980
 to the needs that we see around us.

474
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,180
 It's prayer that leads us and propels us

475
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:44,100
 into living out the river model vision in 2021.

476
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,940
 Besides the Lord's Prayer, by the way,

477
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,980
 this is the only time where Jesus tells us

478
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,380
 specifically what to pray for.

479
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,020
 Where he actually gives us the content, pray this.

480
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,300
 So we should pay attention to that.

481
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,980
 And Jesus is saying, don't get overwhelmed,

482
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,300
 don't get stuck in that place,

483
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,180
 don't just rush also into it,

484
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,740
 but pray and remember who I am.

485
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,980
 I'm the Lord of the harvest, I'm already,

486
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,260
 I'm the good shepherd, I'm already working in people's lives.

487
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,260
 I'm the one who gives divine appointments,

488
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,060
 I'm the one who transforms and who changes lives.

489
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,100
 I'm the one who has all the resources that are needed

490
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,380
 to love this city.

491
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,740
 Start with prayer.

492
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:38,300
 And when his church prays,

493
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,420
 and when his church prays, guess what happens?

494
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,020
 The river starts flowing

495
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,700
 'cause Jesus starts sending out his river workers.

496
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,620
 Now, the word for being sent out, and I love this,

497
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,380
 this is actually my favorite little nugget

498
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,340
 from this passage, is ekbalo.

499
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,260
 And it actually can be translated as cast out,

500
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,580
 flung out, drive out, thrust out.

501
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,020
 Now, just think about this.

502
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:17,020
 Jesus is telling us to pray that we, his people, the church,

503
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,300
 is gonna be cast out.

504
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,300
 This is the same word that Jesus used to cast out a demon.

505
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:29,220
 So he's telling us to pray for workers to be cast out.

506
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,580
 Now, why is that?

507
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,300
 Well, I think the answer is obvious

508
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,940
 'cause a lot of times we're living in our comfort place

509
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,780
 and we're just dealing with our own lives.

510
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,220
 Or we are living in this place of just being overwhelmed

511
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,980
 and we need the powerful move of the Holy Spirit

512
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,860
 to light a fire in our belly to go out

513
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:59,380
 and to do the work that Jesus is inviting us into,

514
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,980
 his healing, his redeeming, his restoring work.

515
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,380
 So I wanna challenge you this year to pray

516
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,780
 that Jesus will cast us out as his river workers

517
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,500
 all over Hong Kong.

518
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,300
 And in January, we are having our fast,

519
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,660
 so that's a perfect time, you have no excuse.

520
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,580
 That's a perfect time to be praying.

521
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,580
 So let's see what happens as we do that.

522
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:27,020
 Now, in Matthew 10, one through five,

523
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,140
 so we're gonna continue looking here at this passage,

524
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,660
 and I'm not gonna read all of this.

525
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,820
 I'm not gonna butcher all the disciples' names,

526
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,660
 but I'm gonna just read a couple of verses.

527
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,900
 He says, "Jesus called his 12 disciples to him

528
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:43,260
 "and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits

529
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,420
 "and to heal every disease and illness."

530
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,180
 And then there's a name of the 12 apostles,

531
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,340
 and I continue in verse five.

532
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,580
 He says, "These 12 Jesus sent out.

533
00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:00,340
 "The disciples prayed for workers to be sent out,

534
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,180
 "and then Jesus sends them out.

535
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,020
 "They're the answer to their prayer.

536
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,580
 "When Jesus commissions them as apostles,

537
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,520
 "as sent out ones, he gives them authority

538
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,860
 "to cast out evil spirits and to heal

539
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,140
 "every disease and affliction."

540
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,740
 And in other words, he provides for them

541
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,520
 the gifts of ministry that they need to do his work.

542
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,420
 And guess what?

543
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,740
 When we pray about being cast out,

544
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,740
 now Jesus, he also, when Jesus sends us out

545
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,740
 to carry out the river model vision,

546
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,580
 he empowers us for the task at hand,

547
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,500
 and he also gives us the specific gifts of ministry

548
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,380
 that we need to carry out his work.

549
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,100
 This is something that we can be encouraged by,

550
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,900
 because Jesus, he sets us up for success, not for failure.

551
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,600
 He calls us into something that we can actually do.

552
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:05,420
 Now, in this passage, there's a significant shift

553
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,420
 and transformation.

554
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,300
 The disciples of Jesus, they've been sort of tagging along

555
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,580
 with Jesus and watching him,

556
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,980
 and it must have been pretty cool to watch him.

557
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,980
 I wish I could have been one of the disciples

558
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,700
 during that time and seen Jesus in that way in action.

559
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,740
 But they've been watching him.

560
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,600
 And so now, through this prayer,

561
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,740
 there's a transformation.

562
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,740
 They become active participants in Jesus's work.

563
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,180
 They're no longer just observers.

564
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,780
 They're active participants.

565
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,820
 Now, I believe that Jesus is calling us,

566
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,580
 he wants to do a shift in us as a church

567
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,980
 from watching maybe ministry leaders,

568
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,460
 or there's always a certain group of people

569
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,700
 who do a lot of watching them and just being observers.

570
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,540
 He wants to shift us to being his river workers

571
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,360
 and active participants in what he wants to do

572
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,160
 in Hong Kong in 2021.

573
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,200
 Now, this shift, it's a supernatural thing.

574
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,880
 We can't force that on our own.

575
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,360
 It's the Holy Spirit working in us.

576
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,760
 And so let's pray for that.

577
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,080
 So how can we step into 2021

578
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,380
 and start living out the river model vision?

579
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,000
 How do we do that?

580
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,100
 Well, first, start with prayer.

581
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,960
 Pray for workers to be cast out into the city

582
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,000
 as his river workers.

583
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,540
 Next, realize that Jesus, he uses the word workers.

584
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,500
 The Greek word for workers,

585
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,980
 here used here is ergates,

586
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,260
 which simply means an agricultural worker or laborer.

587
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,420
 So Jesus, he tells us to pray for workers.

588
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,420
 Not for expert community developers, theologians,

589
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,160
 particular personality types.

590
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,420
 If someone has those skills or that personality,

591
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,360
 that's awesome.

592
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,980
 But he tells us to pray for ordinary people

593
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,320
 like you and like me to go out and do his work.

594
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,780
 But we struggle with that, don't we?

595
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,700
 A lot of times we feel inadequate

596
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,860
 or we don't feel qualified

597
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,940
 or we feel like we're lacking something

598
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,260
 or we personally become 50 times more mature.

599
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,260
 And so we don't think that God can use us

600
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,720
 and work through us.

601
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,300
 However, even small acts of service can be used by God

602
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,100
 to achieve his purposes

603
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,920
 because we are not acting in our own strength,

604
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,220
 but out of God's strength

605
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,880
 and we're sent by his authority

606
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,740
 and we're equipped with his giftings.

607
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,660
 Now let me share with you a true story.

608
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,860
 This is a story from the US.

609
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,380
 There was a high school student and he was walking home

610
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,180
 and then he was looking over and he saw this other student

611
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,340
 and the student was dropping his books.

612
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,300
 He was carrying a lot of books,

613
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
 so he decided, you know what, I'm gonna go over.

614
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,640
 And so he helped the student pick up the books.

615
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,820
 And then he was thinking to himself,

616
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,140
 hey, if I don't help this person carry home,

617
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,220
 I'm just gonna keep dropping them,

618
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,780
 so I'm just gonna walk home with them.

619
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,660
 So he helped him carry the books home.

620
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,500
 And they started talking and they had a great conversation

621
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,580
 and a friendship grew out of that.

622
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,580
 So several months later,

623
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,540
 the student that had dropped the books,

624
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,220
 he told his friend,

625
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,140
 hey, do you remember the day when we first met?

626
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,100
 Yeah, yeah, of course I do.

627
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,180
 He's like, do you know why I had all these books

628
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,060
 with me that day?

629
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,360
 He's like, no.

630
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,360
 Well, I had gone to school,

631
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,880
 I had cleared out my locker

632
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,360
 'cause nobody talked to me, nobody cared for me,

633
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,980
 and I was gonna take my life.

634
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,880
 That day, you saved my life.

635
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,840
 Never underestimate small acts of kindness and compassion

636
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,340
 and how God can use them.

637
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,000
 He wants to work powerfully through them.

638
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,600
 He wants to touch people's lives

639
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,280
 through you here in Hong Kong.

640
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,880
 He wants his love and compassion to flow through you.

641
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,180
 Now, the river model vision,

642
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,400
 it's more about regularly practicing small acts of kindness

643
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,280
 and mercy than one-off grand gestures.

644
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,680
 So it's about that daily dying to self

645
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,720
 and going that little bit out of our way

646
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,320
 to help somebody pick up books

647
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,040
 or to pay attention to somebody, listen to someone,

648
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,720
 to ask somebody out for lunch.

649
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,840
 And don't underestimate how God wants to work through you

650
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,400
 and touch people's lives.

651
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,160
 Now, I wanna leave you with two, what I call,

652
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,000
 and I'm really excited about this term, by the way,

653
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,320
 river habits that you can practice.

654
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,780
 The first one is reach out to two people each week

655
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,380
 to see how they're doing.

656
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,360
 It's as simple, every one of us can do that.

657
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,760
 And I wanna encourage you to go above and beyond

658
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,680
 the people you usually reach out to or talk to.

659
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,120
 So don't talk to your best friend,

660
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,000
 you're already talking to them anyhow.

661
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,360
 And just give them a call,

662
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,360
 take some time to talk to your neighbor,

663
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,800
 talk to somebody at your workplace,

664
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,120
 but also talk to somebody at church

665
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,000
 that maybe you don't know that well.

666
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,080
 So talk to two people every week and see how they're doing.

667
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,400
 And put that in your calendar, by the way,

668
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,880
 if you don't put it in your calendar, it doesn't happen.

669
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,520
 Second, the second river habit,

670
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,640
 bless someone this week.

671
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,280
 Go again, above and beyond what you normally would do.

672
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,680
 Buy somebody some awesome coffee,

673
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,460
 buy a family that's struggling with groceries,

674
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,320
 buy some groceries and get to know them better.

675
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,200
 Encourage someone with a note

676
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,760
 or with some really thoughtful words

677
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,000
 that you're gonna share with them.

678
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,920
 So I wanna challenge you to choose

679
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,120
 one of these two habits this week and to practice them

680
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,580
 and trust that God will work through them.

681
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,220
 Tell someone that you're gonna do that,

682
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,780
 like invite your community group and talk to your spouse,

683
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,780
 talk to your friend and challenge them to do it as well

684
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,980
 and see what happens as Christ's compassion flows through you

685
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,220
 to the people around you.

686
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,140
 The city that we love,

687
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,260
 the people that we love are in pain.

688
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:05,100
 In 2021, will we make ourselves available

689
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,020
 to be God's river workers?

690
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,060
 Let me pray for us.

691
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:16,020
 Jesus, you have seen our 2020,

692
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,300
 you care deeply about it,

693
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,020
 but not only ours, but also for this whole city.

694
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,580
 And you want everyone to know you as the good shepherd

695
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,420
 and you want your love to flow through the city

696
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:33,500
 where there's hope and new life and transformation.

697
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,040
 And Jesus, I pray that you would cast us out

698
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,860
 as your river workers in 2021,

699
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,900
 that we would say yes to that,

700
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,980
 that we would allow ourselves to be used by you

701
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,060
 for your kingdom purpose.

702
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,100
 Now pray right now also for those who just maybe,

703
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,040
 we don't feel confident that you would give them,

704
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,140
 that you would release faith and encourage to do this,

705
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,380
 that even this week as we practice these habits,

706
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,300
 that we already would experience you working through that.

707
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,580
 And also wanna pray for those

708
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,780
 who are still struggling and in pain,

709
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,080
 that you would bring people around them to walk with them,

710
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,000
 that we know that you are with them,

711
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,800
 that you would continue to reveal yourself

712
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,920
 and just lift those burdens

713
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,480
 and that you would speak to them, give them specific words

714
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,120
 that will guide them and give them direction and hope.

715
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,160
 And so we pray that you would help us

716
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,240
 to wrap up this 2020 well,

717
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,200
 but also that you would bless our 2021.

718
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,920
 And so into your hands, we commit that.

719
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,080
 In your name, Jesus, amen.
