[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Once in a year, I don't have to think about what to wear.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   It's assigned for me by my mommy
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.960]   'cause she arranged the outfit.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.800]   That's great.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.860]   How are you all doing?
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   Okay, half of you feel okay.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.920]   Half of you are good.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.760]   You all right?
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.680]   Doing okay?
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.820]   Yeah, much better.
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.940]   So you know last week we wrapped up
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.440]   the Forward Together series.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.920]   We talked a lot about unity,
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.480]   how we can join together as one church,
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.160]   multicultural, multigenerational.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680]   We walk together.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.120]   And in fact, we cover a lot in this past year.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.880]   We started a year by talking about prayer,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.760]   how we can relate to God during our time of fasting.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.320]   And we joined one time and we fast together.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.560]   And then we talked about this person called Joseph.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.800]   Anybody was here when we talk about Joseph?
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.880]   We talked about all his ups and downs
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.000]   and how he followed God no matter what.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.280]   How he was also a man of discipline.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.320]   When temptation came,
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.000]   he actually stood firm in his temptation.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.560]   And then we had a chance in midst of our Joseph series,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.520]   Pastor Tim and Pastor Ivan brought the vision
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.800]   of the church in 2025 to us,
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800]   which is to reach out to the younger generation.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.120]   That's why we started talking about this idea,
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.840]   what if we could become a multicultural
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.200]   and multigenerational church family here in Yuen Long.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.320]   But then we know in order to reach the next generation,
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.320]   there's so much that we need to do
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.200]   and so much we need to draw from God's resources,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.240]   especially when it comes to what we're seeing
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.000]   in the next generation right now.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.280]   We see a lot of depression.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.200]   We see a lot of people that are giving up on their lives.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.520]   They are taking their own lives.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.040]   We need the resurrection power of Jesus
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.760]   to be in a city, to be in a community.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.120]   And we dedicated some time to that.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.760]   And so finally, in the last couple of weeks,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.200]   we were talking about how we can join hands together
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.760]   and move forward together as one church family.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.200]   Are you following?
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   And so when I was just praying and just waiting on God
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.640]   on what to talk about, what more can I add to that?
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640]   I just, oh, by the way, I just wanna tell you
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.240]   that we're not starting any new sermon series today.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.560]   We, once in a while in our church,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.040]   we normally have some one-off messages.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.720]   And today this is one of those messages.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.640]   And I've been just praying and asking,
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.440]   okay, God, what's on your heart?
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.320]   What do you wanna speak to us?
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.160]   And I felt God has put something on my heart today.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.040]   And in fact, I think he has put that on my heart
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.040]   for some 20 years.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.640]   And so it's been a message that has been brewing in my heart.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.940]   I always felt it.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.240]   And honestly, this week I'm trying to find words for it.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.480]   And I just feel like all my words fall short.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.880]   So that was a great song.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.800]   It was just in, yeah, all my words fall short.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.600]   But I do pray that as, you know,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.560]   during this time when we're here,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.600]   I pray that the Holy Spirit will come
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.280]   and tell us what he wants to tell us.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.520]   And again, amen for that.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.600]   I'm gonna begin with an event
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.260]   that happened almost 20 years ago.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.240]   So maybe a little bit less than 20 years ago,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.000]   I was in a camp.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.240]   Yeah, if you've been hearing my stories,
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.040]   I went to a lot of camps when I was young, do that a lot.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   But this one was slightly different.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.760]   I was not supposed to be there.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.680]   It was actually a pastor's retreat.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.200]   And apparently almost 20 years ago, I wasn't a pastor yet.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.080]   I was just a teenager or late teens, something like that.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.120]   But I remember I joined this camp
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   because if you've heard my story before,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.520]   I left school that summer.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.680]   Like, I mean, I dropped out of school that summer.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.720]   So I got nothing to do.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   And my pastor, he was kind enough to bring me along.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720]   So I said, yeah, sure, why not?
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.980]   Go to this pastor's retreat camp.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.880]   Of course, most of what happened there,
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.000]   I have already forgotten,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.640]   but I remember one particular message
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.800]   by one particular speaker or pastor.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.320]   And he said something like this that really stuck with me
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.280]   for the next 20 years.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.960]   He said, there are a few kinds of people in church,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.060]   from his observation of being a pastor for that long.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.640]   He said, there are some people,
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.080]   they are there or they are here
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.360]   because they want to be blessed by God.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.800]   So in my understanding, I guess that would mean people,
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.920]   they come and have a relationship with God
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.240]   because they want his blessings.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.000]   They needed something from God in their lives.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.520]   So they come join the church.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.880]   They would come and worship.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.200]   They come and read the Bible.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.980]   They come and do all this Christian stuff
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.120]   in order to win the favor of God,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.560]   in order that God would bless them.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.020]   If I behave, if I do good enough,
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.700]   and I'll be in God's good list.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.400]   So I'll have his favor in my life.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.120]   And so we see that some people,
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.120]   they may show up or they may start having this journey
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.340]   of faith because they needed or they wanted
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.040]   the favor of God or the blessings of God.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.200]   And yet the pastor went on,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.500]   he said there are yet another group of people,
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.480]   they want to be used by God.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.440]   They dedicate themselves to ministry.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.920]   They dedicate themselves to serving in church.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.720]   They will be there week in, week out.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.200]   And some of them, they even, they would become,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.160]   they would go full time.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.840]   They would spend all the time in church.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.560]   Well, like myself, spending a lot of time in the church,
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.920]   like serving.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.360]   And don't get me wrong, it's wonderful.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.520]   It's amazing, especially when you start to see in serving
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.100]   that God has given you particular gifts and talent,
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.860]   that you can use those talents for his kingdom,
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.700]   for his work.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.260]   And you said, wow, this is how God can use me.
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.080]   He prepared me.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.380]   That's amazing.
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.240]   It's an amazing experience, isn't it?
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.200]   If you have been in ministry before,
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.560]   maybe you've been to missions,
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.620]   if maybe you've been serving in church
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.300]   and you saw how what you did,
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.160]   how it has made a difference for people,
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.020]   how it has made a difference for those around you,
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.380]   and you will feel glad about it.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.580]   And that's great.
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.880]   Then that this pastor just went on, he said,
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.740]   but yet there are still another type of people in church.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.060]   These are the people that all they want
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.520]   is to walk with God every day.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.900]   All they want is to be his friends.
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.820]   All they want, it's like probably what King David
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.000]   in the Bible did.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.560]   We know that King David, he himself was no perfect man.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.160]   He made a lot of mistakes.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.700]   He did some bad stuff.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.000]   Things that even he was not really proud of.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.840]   But then when God talked about David in the Bible,
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.140]   he used a very specific phrase.
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.240]   God says, this is the man after my own heart.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.040]   That he would all day long, he would search for God's heart.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.400]   Like he will ask God this question,
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.120]   God, what's on your mind today?
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.680]   Like God, what's on your heart?
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   How can I fulfill that?
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.440]   How can I walk according to your heart?
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.160]   How can I do what you want in this kingdom
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.700]   that you have entrusted me?
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.120]   How can I follow you in my everyday life?
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.680]   And not just to follow you,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.120]   not just to check all the checklist,
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.420]   but how can I really bless your heart, God?
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.360]   We saw that David, the guy like this,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.360]   a man after God's own heart.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.320]   I remember walking away from that camp.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.860]   Something inside of me felt different.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.440]   I would say my priorities started changing.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.120]   I would say my prayers started changing.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.960]   I start to pray different things.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.040]   And then I realized that's because my perspective has changed.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.360]   My paradigm has changed.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.200]   And even my purpose in life has changed.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.960]   Like for me, I wasn't just trying to be someone
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.080]   who served God, but I do that.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.440]   I send the Holy Spirit, put that longing inside of me
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.960]   that I also wanna be one of those who walk with God,
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.240]   who journey with him.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.920]   I also wanna be his friend.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.560]   And this paradigm shift I experienced that day,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.680]   some 20, almost 20 years ago,
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.360]   perhaps it was one of the most important things
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.840]   Jesus wanted to communicate with his disciples.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.080]   One of the heart changes that he really wanted to see
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.760]   before he went to the cross.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.400]   Why do I say that?
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.200]   Let's come back to John.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.120]   He spent five chapters talking about the evening
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.160]   before Jesus went to the cross.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.200]   We look at the Bible, John chapter 13 to 17.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.400]   Normally scholars would call these five chapters
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.200]   or these passage, they call it the farewell discourse.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.240]   That's when Jesus share words with his disciples
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   or he has done something before he finally left
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.960]   and went to the cross.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.320]   But if we look at these passage, these five chapters,
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.080]   we know that there's something special about it
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.840]   or actually John employed a very popular literary structure
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.040]   in those days in Hebrew literature
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.600]   to write these five chapters.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.840]   He actually used a very special method
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.320]   called the chiastic symmetry structure.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.160]   Let me say that again.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.400]   It's a chiastic symmetry structure.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.720]   Meaning, what does that mean?
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.840]   It means that simply put, it's a writing technique
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.960]   that arranged different themes or different passages
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.840]   in an inverted parallel structure.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.840]   So it all revolves around one central point.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.760]   This technique is trying to ensure
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.600]   that this central emphasis where the midpoint,
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.000]   where this, oh, maybe we can have the next slide
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.720]   and you will start to see this.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.360]   You can have the next slide, yes.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.280]   You will see where there's a central point,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.360]   there's a midpoint.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.000]   This point always carries the weightiest theological truth
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.680]   or this is the core message that the author
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.840]   wants to communicate.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.160]   And John uses this special method,
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.560]   the chiastic symmetry structure to write these five chapters
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.120]   to help readers focus on that one core message.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.120]   And this is it.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.120]   In the center, we see from chapter 13 to chapter 17,
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.960]   yes, we covered a lot of things.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.240]   We covered how Jesus washed his disciples' feet
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.320]   and then tell them, hey, this is my new command.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.640]   Love one another just as I love you.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.760]   We knew that he talked about the Holy Spirit,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.600]   how the Holy Spirit would come after he's gone.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.440]   We know all that.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.080]   And we actually, if we read on,
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.280]   we see some of the themes were actually repeated
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.040]   like in a symmetrical kind of structure.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.880]   But there is one main point,
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.320]   one central point in the middle of it.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.920]   That's the core message.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.200]   If you ask John, hey, these five chapters,
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.680]   everything that Jesus talked about
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.920]   before he went to the cross,
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.240]   what do you want to tell us the most?
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.720]   John would probably say, this is the message,
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.400]   the first half of John chapter 15.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.800]   That's the passage where we got the name of our church.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.000]   It's even written in this building right now.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.040]   I am the vine and you are the branches.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   This is the message.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.840]   This is our identity, right?
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.000]   And this passage was one of the core message
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.120]   of the entire gospel of John.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.200]   This is what he wanted to communicate with us.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.280]   And so we see that, you know, Jesus said,
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.880]   he's the vine, we're the branches, remain in me.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.360]   So I will remain in you as well.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.880]   And you can go and bear fruit
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.720]   because when you're apart from me, you can't do much.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.080]   That's the message.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.720]   And if we read on, I'll start from verse nine.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.560]   It says this, Jesus said this,
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.080]   said, as the father has loved me, so have I loved you.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.400]   Now remain in my love.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.080]   If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.440]   Just as I have kept my father's command
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.280]   and remain in his love.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.360]   I have told you this so that my joy may be in you
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.840]   and that your joy may be complete.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:16.480]   My command is this, love each other as I have loved you.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.000]   Greater love has no one than this,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.720]   to lay down one's life for one's friend.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.680]   You are my friends if you do what I command.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.520]   And then Jesus said this word in verse 15.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.640]   He said, I no longer call you servants
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.680]   because a servant does not know his master's business.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   Instead, I have called you friends.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.760]   For everything that I learned from my father,
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.960]   I have made known to you.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.560]   You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.080]   so that you might go and bear fruit, fruit that will last.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.760]   And so that whatever you ask in my name,
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.680]   the father will give you.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.040]   This is my command, love each other.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.880]   Apparently Jesus is establishing his church here saying,
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.560]   hey, I am the vine and you are the branches.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.760]   You have to remain in me.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.960]   And when you do that, you will start to have a community
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.480]   where you would love each other.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.720]   But then right before the end of this core message,
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.800]   John wrote down what Jesus told his disciples
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.760]   that I no longer call you servant.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.080]   Now I call you my friends.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.680]   This paradigm shift, this paradigm change,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.600]   perhaps is one of the most important things
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.520]   that Jesus wanted to communicate to his disciples
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.000]   before he went to the cross.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.680]   So John skillfully put this verses
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.120]   at the center of Jesus's farewell message.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.480]   In other words, this is one of the most important things
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.240]   that he wanted to communicate even to us today.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.400]   We know that Jesus gave the new commandment
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.520]   to love one another in chapter 13,
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.960]   right after he washed his disciples feet.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.280]   And we know that, yeah, there's a prayer in chapter 17
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.920]   where he said, I and the father, we are one.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.960]   So you have to become one as well.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.040]   We know our whole unity sermon series was based on that,
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.720]   was based on Jesus's prayer,
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.440]   saying that because him and the father, they are one.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.280]   So he's encouraging us, commanding us, we have to be one,
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.280]   just like him and the father, they are one as well.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.200]   Of course, we know about,
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.040]   which the Holy Spirit was mentioned in chapters 14 or 16,
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   but the heart of Jesus's final words to his disciples
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.840]   at the central point of this passage,
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.640]   it was this invitation for us to abide in him,
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.240]   to abide in Jesus, to abide in his love
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.920]   or to remain in his love,
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.080]   like branches abide or remain to the vine in the vine.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.920]   The sign of us abiding or remaining in Jesus
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.680]   is actually first that Jesus,
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.560]   he would himself lay down his life for you and me,
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.680]   for all his people.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.920]   Jesus is the one who first took action,
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.040]   dying for us on the cross, which soon after he said this,
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.600]   he actually went to the cross
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.640]   to reveal the death of his love for you and me.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.400]   And then in return, we would also lay down our standards,
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.600]   we'll lay down what we want
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.720]   so that we could come to Jesus in obedience
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.320]   to follow his standards,
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.840]   to follow his commands in obedience.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.960]   You see Jesus laying down his life for us
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.560]   to reveal his love to us
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.520]   so that when we respond to that kind of love,
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.680]   we come willingly to surrender ourselves,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.520]   to obey his commands.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.720]   If you've been to a wedding before,
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.160]   if you've heard of a wedding sermons,
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.440]   this is one of the very popular sermons
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.280]   that would be preached in a wedding,
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.560]   like in Ephesians five,
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.320]   like how the husband is supposed to be the head of the family
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.880]   like Christ is laid down,
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.360]   so the husband should lay down his life for his wife
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.480]   and the wife in return should submit to the husband.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.880]   This is where the idea actually came from.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.280]   Jesus first did it himself
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.680]   and he's inviting us,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.360]   he took the first step by dying for us
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.560]   while we're still sinner.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.320]   He's inviting us into that kind of love,
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.040]   into that kind of relationship.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.880]   And not just that,
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.880]   he said, you know, from now on,
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.120]   I'm going to shift this paradigm of our relationship.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.680]   Our relationship, it's no longer a master-servant hierarchy,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.640]   but we will enter into a covenant friendship.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:40.200]   In other words, we're no longer just executors of tasks.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.680]   Like whatever God told us we have to do
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.160]   because we are servants, we got no choice.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.560]   We're Christians.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.160]   If you're a Christian, you must do this
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.280]   and you must not do that.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.320]   Sometimes we grew up, I don't know about you,
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.640]   but I've been in cultures,
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.600]   I've been in traditions like that.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.800]   Sometimes I just do it because I'm a Christian.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.440]   People just tell me, hey, if you're a Christian,
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.280]   you have to do this.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.920]   If you're a Christian, you should not say that,
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.120]   you should not do that.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.320]   You should show up at what time, when, you know,
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.360]   it's our responsibilities.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.000]   I'm not saying that is wrong,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.440]   but I'm just saying that Jesus indeed,
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.520]   before He went to the cross,
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.920]   He tried to shift that paradigm.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.720]   In our relationship with God, He said,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.520]   you're no longer just executors of tasks,
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.960]   but you're confidence of God's heart.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.600]   He shares His heart with you through me now.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.720]   We're no longer duty-driven.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.880]   We're love-compelled.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.600]   We should be compelled by love in everything we do.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.120]   We grew up in this part of the world, Asia,
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.680]   and I know we're quite good at being servants, honestly,
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.120]   'cause we are in one of the most performance-driven,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.960]   duty-driven kind of culture.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.240]   And as servants of God,
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.720]   we seek to do the work of His kingdom,
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.520]   we build churches, we preach the gospel,
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.520]   we witness Jesus, we transform lives with His love.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.560]   These are all great things.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.520]   And most of the time, there's nothing wrong about it.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.800]   But I remember when I grew up, I started serving.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.880]   It was one of the times when,
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.400]   in the lowest point of my life,
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.600]   I've shared a little bit with you all before,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.280]   like when I dropped out of school like two times.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.600]   That was about the time God brought me to places
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.480]   to serve in front of people on the stage
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.760]   and where I would receive recognition.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.160]   So at those days, when I was younger,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.400]   being on the stage doing church ministry
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.720]   is the only place in my life
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.400]   where I received some recognition,
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.560]   where I would have people
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.360]   like putting their hands together for me.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   And soon, I realized, it has kind of become my identity.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:56.080]   So a lot of you know that I actually did translation
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.840]   in a lot of Christian's events.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.960]   And so sometimes when they don't get me to translate,
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.760]   I would feel very insecure.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.680]   What have I done wrong?
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.040]   Have I done wrong that they don't get me
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.440]   back to the station?
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.840]   Or maybe I've been leading worship in church
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.400]   and one day, I'm no longer there.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.680]   And if I go to church and I'm not doing anything at church,
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.000]   just standing there, I would feel,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.160]   what am I doing here?
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.320]   Why am I not doing anything?
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.760]   How come I'm not worship leading or service leading
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.000]   or I'm not speaking or I'm not leading a prayer?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.160]   When ministry has become my identity,
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.560]   we sometimes long for recognition.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.240]   It comes with what we do.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.360]   If we're in a culture where what we do is who we are
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.800]   and we bring that kind of culture,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.160]   we bring that kind of mentality into church
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.640]   and we're a very firm servant of God,
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.800]   that part is still good.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.240]   When we serve, God always appreciate it.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.240]   But if we put our identity,
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.560]   we anchor our identity on what we do,
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.360]   then perhaps we'll miss the point.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.720]   Or maybe in our walk with Jesus,
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.920]   we only know that yes, he will come and bless us
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.320]   and I anchor my relationship with him
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.480]   on all those blessings on what he would do for me.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.160]   What if one day, some of your prayers were not answered
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.360]   and you start to feel these kind of doubts towards God,
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.640]   like, is God asleep?
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.120]   Is he too busy?
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.480]   How come there is like, there should be two blue tapes,
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.040]   but I don't get any reply?
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   And we'll start to doubt God's love for us
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.840]   if all our relationship with him
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.480]   is based on what we get from him,
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.840]   based on his blessings.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.880]   I've been there in my life.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.200]   I've been there like,
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.640]   I've been in times where I felt I've been praying so hard,
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.080]   I've been serving so hard,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.200]   I've been doing everything so hard.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.880]   Why are my prayers not answered?
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.960]   Why God didn't come and help me?
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.960]   Why he didn't heal me?
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.200]   Why he didn't just come and comfort me,
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.440]   help me with whatever I'm asking?
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.120]   I've been trying so hard already.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.560]   But when I put my identity in what I do
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.680]   and not what really God calls me,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.320]   he calls me to be his friend.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.640]   If I see myself as a worker and come before him,
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.840]   hey, I work for you, I should receive my wages.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.520]   You should do something for me in return.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.040]   I'm missing the point.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.880]   God is saying, you know what?
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.440]   I wanna invite you into a new kind of paradigm.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.160]   I wanna invite you into a new kind of relationship with me.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.000]   But funny enough,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.880]   this is actually not a new kind of relationship.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.800]   This is actually sort of like an old relationship,
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.200]   like an old one.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.720]   When he created mankind,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.240]   that's always what he wanted with us.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.480]   Remember like earlier I mentioned,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:03.360]   when I heard this message from that pastor
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.480]   a long time ago,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.360]   I made some prayers in my lives
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.040]   and some things inside of me changed,
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.200]   but well, actually all the ups and downs
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.320]   didn't change immediately.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.880]   I still went through all those ups and downs.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.960]   I remember there was this particular time again,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.600]   like around the time when I dropped out of school,
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.200]   there was one day I was on a bus.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.520]   I was on this upper deck towards the end.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.360]   During that time,
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.720]   I always sit at the end of the upper deck of the bus
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.680]   because every time when I'm alone on the bus,
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.560]   my tears would just run like down my cheek.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.120]   I would just start crying
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.240]   'cause there's so much pain
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.400]   and there's so much things I'm struggling in my life
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.120]   that I cannot figure out.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.760]   I remember there was this one particular time I told God,
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.920]   I said, "Hey, you know what?
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.280]   I think whatever I heard you said all those years ago
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.400]   that I thought you were calling me,
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.920]   I think either I made a mistake,
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.560]   either I heard the wrong voice or you picked the wrong guy.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.280]   That person cannot be me.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.000]   Look at me, I'm such a mess.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.440]   I'm a loser.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.000]   I cannot be that person you're calling
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.760]   to do the work of your kingdom.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.600]   Look at God, I think I'm gonna give up right now.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.560]   Think you got the wrong person.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.640]   I'm walking away.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.000]   If I look at myself,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.160]   if all I wanted to be is a pastor or missionary,
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.760]   if all I wanted to be was just a servant of God,
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.600]   all I wanted to do is just to serve God
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.760]   and I see that as my success or failure,
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.040]   I probably would have walked away that day.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.040]   But it was actually this message that I've heard.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.520]   This is message that the Holy Spirit is gently inviting me.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.480]   You know what, Chapman?
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.040]   Even if you fail as a servant,
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.240]   you will never fail as my friend.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.000]   You're always my friend.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.840]   I have laid out my life for you.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.600]   I will always love you no matter what.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.960]   You don't have to strive to be my servant.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.280]   Come and be my friend.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.240]   All I want is a friend.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:19.920]   So in my tears, I say,
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.520]   okay, you've got a friend in me.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:28.160]   Jesus wants a friend.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.680]   He wants us to understand that, yes,
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.000]   it's amazing when we can work with him
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.440]   and do all those amazing things,
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.360]   using our gifts and talents or ministering to people,
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.680]   going on mission trips or serving in church.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.240]   Those are all amazing things.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.080]   But Jesus says, you know what, from today onwards,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.880]   I don't call you servants.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.120]   I call you friends.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.480]   You are here to share a piece of my heart.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.320]   Whatever I know from my father,
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.080]   I'm going to share with you.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.440]   Servants, they don't know the master's business,
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.280]   but I'm here to share with you.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.960]   I want you to know my heart.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.720]   I want you to understand me a little bit better.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:14.400]   And, you know, actually throughout John chapter 13 to 17,
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:20.600]   we keep seeing, or Jesus keeps repeating words like,
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.280]   the father has loved me, so I have loved you.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.440]   Or things like, I am in my father
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.200]   and you are in me.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.920]   You know, when Jesus talks about his relationship with us,
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.720]   he always referred back to his relationship with his father.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.100]   In other words, Jesus has been inviting us
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.000]   into the kind of relationship with him
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.280]   like the one he had with his father.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.760]   And what kind of a relationship he had with his father.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.760]   Actually, John made it very clear
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.720]   from the first verse of this gospel.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.080]   John chapter one, verse one says this,
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.760]   in the beginning was the word
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.800]   and the word was with God and the word was God.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.360]   I'm highlighting this phrase, the word was with God.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.360]   Yes, in Greek, this word with, pros,
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.200]   sometimes it's translated as with,
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.880]   like being in proximity that we're in the same space
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.360]   or we're near each other.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.640]   But there are other translations as well there.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.880]   The other meanings actually means towards,
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.680]   like facing towards.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.400]   So you can understand this verse not just as the word,
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.040]   Jesus, the son, it's around God in his vicinity.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.120]   The son, the word, Jesus Christ,
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.160]   is actually facing towards God.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.480]   The word was facing towards God.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.960]   The word was having a face-to-face relationship
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.360]   with God the father ever since the beginning of the world,
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.000]   or even before the beginning of the world.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.680]   He has always been in this intimate relationship.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.320]   They're looking at one another.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.060]   They're sharing breath together.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.320]   They are so intimate.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.280]   They know him, he knows the father so well,
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.160]   and he's inviting us into that kind of relationship with him,
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.880]   this kind of face-to-face relationship with him.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.640]   In Exodus, it says this.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   It talks about a man called Moses
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.080]   and his relationship with God.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.920]   The Bible says this,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.960]   the Lord will speak to Moses face-to-face
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.980]   as one speak to a friend.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.720]   Friendship, it's like this,
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.280]   or the kind of friendship that Jesus is inviting us into,
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.400]   it's a face-to-face kind of relationship.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.200]   He's inviting us into this kind of intimacy,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.680]   this kind of face-to-face relationship,
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.520]   this kind of intimacy.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.280]   And you know, sometimes this word face in the Bible,
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.040]   no matter in Old Testament, New Testament,
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.600]   it can be translated as another word.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.600]   This word face sometimes is translated as the presence,
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.760]   such as in Genesis 3, verse eight.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.800]   Genesis 3, verse eight happens after men and women,
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.720]   Adam and Eve, they took the fruit from the tree,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.560]   and after the fall of men and women happened.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.200]   And so let me read this to you.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.520]   And they, Adam and Eve,
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.340]   heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.360]   in the cool of the day,
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.080]   and the man and his wife hid themselves
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.400]   from the presence or from the face of the Lord God
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.140]   among the trees of the garden.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.400]   We start hiding from God's face.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.800]   That face-to-face relationship was broken the day
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.040]   when Adam and Eve took that fruit.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.960]   But in God's heart, this was always what he wanted.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.200]   He always wanted this face-to-face relationship,
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.920]   this friendship with his creation, with humans.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.080]   And Jesus is finally,
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.480]   because his word is done on the cross,
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.080]   he's inviting us back.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.440]   Now the work is done, the redemptive work,
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.000]   it's finally done on the cross.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.240]   So now he could invite us back
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.520]   to that intimate friendship with God.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.920]   It means that we could have this face-to-face encounter
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.000]   with him again.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.200]   And so, although we know that men and women,
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.800]   after they fell, they were trying to hide their face
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.740]   from God, but we also see that
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.000]   throughout the entire biblical narrative,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.120]   people who want a friendship with God,
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.840]   people who wanna walk with God,
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.440]   they have been seeking the face of God.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.640]   They have been seeking the presence of God.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.680]   This is what David said in one of his Psalms.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.640]   He said, "One thing I ask from the Lord,
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.460]   "this only do I seek,
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.860]   "that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.800]   "all of the days of my life,
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.580]   "to gaze on the beauty of the Lord
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.380]   "and to seek him in his temple.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.220]   "And my heart says of you, seek his face,
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.540]   "your face, Lord, I will seek."
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:51.500]   This is a hard cry of a man
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:55.740]   who was described as the one who is after God's own heart.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.400]   Was he perfect?
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.940]   No, far from it.
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.340]   But this is the guy that he would always chase
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.300]   after God's heart.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.140]   He always wanna be his friend.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.340]   He always wanna journey with him every day.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.820]   He always wanna ask God, what's on your heart?
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.380]   What would you like me to do in this kingdom of yours?
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.260]   And that's why he's the one who has served
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:23.700]   the heart of God, the will of God in his generation,
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:28.220]   because he was the one who is after God's own heart.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.380]   He's the one who wants to be God's friend.
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:35.140]   And you know,
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.140]   being God's friend, therefore,
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:45.800]   means we live a life to seek God's face.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.780]   Not occasionally, not when you needed something,
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.860]   when you needed a promotion,
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.220]   when you are sick, you needed healing,
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.380]   you want a relationship,
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.820]   you want a certain boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever,
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.580]   you start to come to God's presence,
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.080]   seek his face and ask for something.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.340]   No, that's not like that.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.900]   Seeking the face of God means like,
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.420]   I just come and enjoy him every day.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.760]   If you've been in love before,
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.820]   you would definitely understand what I mean.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.080]   Just seeing that person in front of you,
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.100]   just looking at that person's face,
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.260]   and you feel and you sense joy
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.040]   overwhelming your heart already.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.380]   That's why David also wrote in one of his Psalms,
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.700]   Psalm 16, he said,
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.340]   there is the fullness of joy in your presence,
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.420]   like in your face,
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.820]   there's fullness of joy when I see your face,
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.280]   when I'm in your presence.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.500]   That joy, I don't need you to do anything for me,
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.620]   I don't need you to bless me,
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.260]   I don't need you to use me to kill a Goliath
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:51.260]   or win a war or serve anyone or to do some king stuff.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.620]   I'm just satisfied and happy in your presence.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:00.260]   I'm so secure in your love.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.140]   And I know I'm your friend.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.380]   A friend of God is a person
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.260]   who just simply come and seek his face
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.740]   before he even seek God's hand.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.500]   It's not about what you can do for me, God,
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:20.500]   it's just you, I enjoy you just as you enjoy me.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:24.460]   And I wanna have that kind of relationship with you.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.060]   I'm here to seek your face,
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.140]   I'm here to immerse myself in your presence
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.700]   and just that, nothing else.
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.980]   You don't have to do anything for me,
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.300]   I'll just enjoy you as it is.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:43.420]   This is the kind of relationship that Jesus died for.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.420]   He died on the cross so that he could invite us
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.940]   back into this kind of friendship with him once again.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:55.720]   But it's also more than just seeking the face of God,
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.620]   being a friend of God is also about sharing the heart of God.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.900]   You see, there's this guy in the Bible called Abraham,
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.860]   he was called a friend of God.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.420]   And God even said, you know,
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.900]   I'm going to wiped out this city
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.180]   'cause they are so sinful,
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.300]   but how can I keep that from Abraham?
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.180]   He's my friend, how can I not tell him?
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.460]   How can I keep things from him?
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.020]   God says, I wanna share my heart with him
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.980]   because he's my friend.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.060]   And in return, Abraham was talking to God,
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.340]   having a dialogue with him.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.660]   He was interceding, praying for people,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.220]   but he was praying according to who God is,
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.540]   according to God's character.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.860]   He said, God, because you are just, but also your mercy,
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.060]   could you not do this or could you do this?
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.220]   Because he knows God's heart
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.060]   because he shares God's heart.
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:54.060]   What if there's a people in a city, in Yuen Long,
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.820]   who don't just come before God and say,
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.740]   God, you know what?
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.060]   I need this this week.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.100]   Oh, I have this need next year, could you help me?
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.100]   What if we have a people who don't just come and say,
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.660]   yeah, I wanna serve, I wanna do something.
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.820]   What if we have a people who come and say,
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.780]   I wanna be friends of God, I wanna walk with him every day.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.540]   And every day when I wake up in the morning,
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.700]   there's one question I wanna ask,
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.620]   God, what's on your heart?
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.020]   Daddy, what's on your heart?
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.140]   What is that?
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.380]   I know Pastor John, he's coming to do this workshop
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.020]   called The Father's Heart of God.
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:31.420]   And this is the basis Jesus made it possible
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.300]   for us to even feel the heart of God
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.660]   because we're his friends and he will share whatever
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.540]   the Father shares with him with us.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.540]   That's why we could have a taste of the Father's heart.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:47.420]   Sometimes when you are with someone,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.940]   if you're open to ask this question,
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.820]   like God, what is on your heart for this person?
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:01.300]   And perhaps you will start to feel what God is feeling,
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.620]   sense what he's sensing or even better,
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.220]   it's written in some lyrics that says,
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.780]   break our hearts for what breaks yours.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.500]   Sometimes you just walk into a place,
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.020]   you just meet people and you immediately feel heartbroken.
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.460]   And then you know, that's because God
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.020]   is heartbroken for them.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.380]   Because of the sin that is entangling their lives,
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.700]   because of the darkness that is surrounding them,
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.620]   because they are in hopelessness,
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.500]   God's heart is broken for them.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.340]   And when you walk towards those people
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.420]   and you ask God, what is on your heart?
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.980]   And you will feel this brokenness in your heart as well.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:44.340]   And whatever you do, it's not just ministry anymore.
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.460]   It's not just what you know
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.140]   as the right thing to do anymore.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.820]   Whatever you're doing, you're sharing God's heart,
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.980]   you're taking that step as though Jesus would have taken
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.580]   if he were here on earth.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.100]   And you move in the direction
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.620]   where his heart is moving as well.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.540]   What if we have more than servants?
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.700]   I mean, servants are great if we're obeying God
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.620]   and doing his will.
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.140]   I believe great things will happen,
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.540]   but what if we have more than that today?
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.300]   What if this paradigm shift happens in this church
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.900]   and we have friends of God in this room,
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.100]   we have friends of God in a community
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.060]   and people are asking all the time,
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.500]   God, what's on your heart?
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.140]   How can I walk with you today?
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.180]   What would you like to share with me today?
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.900]   And when we start walking,
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:34.500]   we start to sense his heart in our neighborhood,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.860]   in our offices.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:41.740]   And like Paul said, I'm just compelled by love.
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.140]   I can't help.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.540]   I must go and help this person.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.740]   I must speak life to that person.
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:51.140]   I must come and make things right in certain situations
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.460]   because that's on the heart of God and I.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.620]   I'm sharing his heart.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:03.460]   What if there's a church like that on earth
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.380]   in Hong Kong and you know,
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.740]   or what if the entire church in the entire world
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.700]   start to think that way,
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.700]   start to be awakened to know that
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.700]   Jesus came to fix one thing,
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.940]   or he fixed many things,
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.020]   but one of the things he fixes
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.620]   that we can be friends with God again,
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:25.060]   that we can walk in this friendship with him.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:29.460]   What if there's a people longing for that,
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.980]   praying for that,
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:34.540]   devoting themselves, their lives for that?
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.820]   How would that look like?
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:46.900]   I've heard of, you know,
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.740]   talking about friendship,
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.540]   I'm gonna close with this story.
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:53.140]   It's a story I heard many years ago.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:57.860]   So another pastor shared this story.
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.740]   And so this pastor,
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.460]   he was serving in a church
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.540]   and there was a deacon or an elder, a leader there.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.940]   He served with him for a while.
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.500]   And after quite some time,
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:13.500]   this elder got older and older and older and older.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.340]   And that elder started having dementia,
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.860]   cannot remember anything.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.060]   So he couldn't serve in church anymore.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.020]   He couldn't even remember people.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.860]   So there was one time,
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.300]   this pastor went to his house to visit him.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.300]   And he just say, "Hey, hi, how are you?"
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.420]   And, but that elder or former elder
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.500]   couldn't even recognize his pastor.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.940]   So the pastor asked him, "What are you doing?"
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.420]   And that elder responded,
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.660]   "I'm just waiting for Jesus.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.900]   I'm just waiting to see his face.
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.540]   I'm waiting for him to come and pick me up,
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.620]   come and meet me."
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:59.660]   I remember that day I prayed, I said,
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.780]   "God, I wish one day if I have dementia,
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.460]   if I've forgotten everything on this planet,
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.460]   of course I wanna remember my family now.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.100]   Now I know, but,
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.860]   well, back then when I was still single, I prayed,
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.900]   "Can I at least remember you?
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.900]   Can I at least remember our friendship?
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.820]   That we are friends?
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.220]   I just want that."
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:30.900]   I'm grateful for people who are serving God
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.540]   very faithfully in our church.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.700]   Truly, I'm very grateful.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.700]   Today as I was praying for us,
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:40.100]   I just felt God is inviting us
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.060]   into a journey even deeper.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.140]   As we talk about unity,
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.340]   as we talk about how we can walk forward together
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.860]   as a church, as a multicultural, multigenerational church.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.420]   You know, these are the, you know,
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.300]   the John 13, John 17,
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.260]   I felt God wants to bring us into John 15 today,
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.900]   the core message that he wants us to be his friends,
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.900]   that he has made it possible on the cross.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.420]   And he said, "Divine Yuen Long,
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.180]   I'm inviting all of you into a friendship.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.100]   The kind of relationship that I have with my father,
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.460]   I wanna have that relationship
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.060]   with each and every one of you."
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.860]   Shall we pray?
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.180]   (sniffling)
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.340]   (sighing)
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:33.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
