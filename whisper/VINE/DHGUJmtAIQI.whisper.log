[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.300]   >> Well, we are in our final sermon for our series
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.980]   of Blowing Water.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.240]   Are you ready?
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.080]   Let's welcome Pastor Ellison.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.080]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.280]   So, Ellison started us off.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.120]   Ellison curated this sermon series
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.100]   and Ellison will now finish.
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.260]   Can we pray for you?
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.040]   >> Yes, please.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.800]   >> Father, we thank you for Ellison and we thank you
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.540]   for his humility and for his prayerful approach
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.940]   to your throne room.
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.180]   I pray, Father God, now as he releases this word
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.480]   that our hearts would be open to receive truth.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.560]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.480]   >> Amen. Thank you, Carla.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.400]   Good morning, church.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.620]   It's good to be with you guys.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.660]   We're celebrating my son's third birthday at home today.
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.840]   So, this morning there was a lot of bubbles
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.880]   and balloons and everything.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.420]   Yeah, so it's been a good morning so far.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.540]   Isaiah turned three.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.940]   Yes, so we're very tired but very glad
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.680]   to be here this morning.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.360]   But it has, it's been a great honor to journey with you
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.580]   through this summer over this sermon series and I hope
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.660]   that it has led to you having better conversations
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.240]   with the people around you,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.160]   especially conversations about Jesus.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.420]   The hope is that you've been reminded and inspired to know
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.360]   that a good conversation can be life-giving,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.040]   can even be life-changing,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.920]   especially if it's centered upon who Jesus is.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.400]   And so, we hope that this is an ongoing thing
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.840]   that you'll take with you as you go about.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.780]   But this series, you know, we have, like Carla says,
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.740]   it's been called Blowing Water as a play on the idea
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.060]   of having conversations and, you know,
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.760]   with chit-chatting with the people around you.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.560]   But actually, the term chozo, right,
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.140]   to blow water can actually also mean something else.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.240]   Right, because it can actually also mean to sort
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.280]   of tell a little bit of a lie, right,
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.840]   to exaggerate the story a little bit, to embellish the truth.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.600]   Now, that's a weird word though, truth.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.160]   It's such a problematic word, right.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.200]   What is truth?
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.680]   How would you define truth?
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.280]   Right, this is an answer that, this is a question
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.720]   that people have been attempting to answer for many,
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.480]   many years in many, many different ways.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.920]   Right, so one area where you might be able to find truth is
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.280]   in the area of mathematics, right.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.560]   Okay, don't switch off, okay.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.940]   One plus one equals two.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.860]   Simple mathematic, we've all learned this in school.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.080]   Simple arithmetic, even a toddler can figure
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.920]   out one plus one is two.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.080]   Now, you see on the screen, you know it, but is it really true?
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.360]   Does one plus one always equal two?
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.960]   Are there times when one plus one does not equal two?
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.960]   So, for example, let's say I had one glass of water,
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.880]   I had another glass of water, so two cups of water,
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.260]   but if I poured them into one cup,
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.380]   then one plus one doesn't equal two.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.920]   One plus one somehow became one again.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.920]   All right, so maybe math doesn't always give us the truth.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.240]   How about logical statements, right.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.860]   Those of you who studied a bit of logic at university
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.540]   or in high school, something like that, right.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.520]   One of the things that people say is that statements
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.840]   that are true should lead to a true conclusion.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.780]   For example, some Hong Kongers are women.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.440]   Andy Lau is a Hong Konger.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.460]   Therefore, Lau is a woman, right.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.620]   Now, I don't think that's not true either.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.080]   Side note, by the way, I have a very interesting encounter
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.700]   with Andy Lau, if you guys ever want to hear about that,
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.820]   take me out for coffee, I'll tell you all about it.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.320]   Very interesting, okay.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.180]   But, okay, you can see it's actually, you know,
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.900]   it just creates more confusion.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.260]   Okay, if we just put theory aside, you know,
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.780]   all these are just theories and mathematics, you know,
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.060]   you guys just started school,
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.660]   you don't want to talk about that yet.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.920]   What about things that really have an impact on our life?
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.340]   Like, for example, for me growing up,
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.300]   there were a few things, three things my grandma
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.140]   and my mom always drilled into my mind,
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.180]   and they swore they were true, okay.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.520]   You might be able to relate, okay.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.580]   They told me these three things. Number one,
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.780]   if you sleep with a fan blowing in your face,
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.520]   you will suffocate and you will die, okay.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.220]   So, don't turn the fan on when you're sleeping, okay,
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.160]   all the time.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.020]   Number two, every piece of rice that you left uneaten will
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.260]   become a scar on your future spouse's face, right,
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.780]   which 好豆皮婆, right.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.460]   So, if you don't finish your rice,
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.100]   you're going to have an ugly wife, okay.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.460]   That was the other thing, okay.
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.160]   Thirdly, don't drink cold water.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.280]   Even if it's super hot outside, do not drink cold water.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.160]   Cold water is like the worst thing for you.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.440]   If you drink cold water, oh, Caleb's agreeing, okay.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.040]   If you drink cold water, you will die, okay.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.480]   So, like, all these things to try and control,
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.600]   to try and, you know, tell me.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.720]   Needless to say, my childhood was spent very full,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.520]   but very hot and very thirsty all the time, okay.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.360]   So, here's the truth, right.
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.700]   Because it's such an elusive thing,
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.020]   that we want to try and grab it,
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.780]   we want to try and understand it,
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.220]   but we can't use our logic, we can't trust mathematics,
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.460]   we can't even trust the people who love us.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.340]   So, what is, how do we get to know the truth?
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.620]   And as we come to the end of the series today,
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.820]   I want us to be sure, I want us to know that the conversations
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.860]   that we've looked at through the past few weeks have been
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.140]   more than just casual conversations.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.420]   It's more than just choice.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.940]   So, it's definitely hasn't been lying or exaggeration
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.100]   or embellishing, because each and every word
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.740]   that we've looked at has been the truth.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.820]   Because they're conversations surrounding who Jesus is.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.580]   And if the truth is what we're after,
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.420]   then we'll only find our answer
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.740]   when we turn our attention to Him.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.780]   So, let's turn our attention to Scripture
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.980]   and see what we can discover.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.420]   John chapter 20, 2018, I can't remember the chapter.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.060]   Anyway, you can follow along on the screen, okay?
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.580]   Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.260]   to the place of the Roman governor.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.380]   By now, it was early morning,
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.020]   and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness,
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.780]   they did not enter the palace,
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.220]   because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.100]   So, Pilate came out and asked them,
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.780]   "What charges do you bring against this man?"
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.260]   "If we were not a criminal," they replied,
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.540]   "we would not have brought him over to you."
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.780]   Pilate said, "Take him yourselves
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.460]   "and judge him by your own law."
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.260]   "But we have no right to execute anyone," they objected.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.020]   This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.220]   about the kind of death he was going to die.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.500]   Pilate then went back inside the palace,
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.140]   summoned Jesus, and asked Him,
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.100]   "Are you the King of the Jews?"
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.820]   "Is this your own idea?" Jesus asked.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.180]   "Or did others talk to you about me?"
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.380]   "Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.740]   "Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.420]   "What is it that you have done?"
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.100]   Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.300]   "If it were, my servants would fight
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.660]   "to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders.
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.100]   "But my kingdom is from another place."
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.660]   "You are a king, then," said Pilate.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.860]   Jesus replied, "You say that I am king?
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.700]   "In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.420]   "is to testify to the truth.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.020]   "Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.940]   "What is truth?" retorted Pilate.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.060]   And with this, he went out again.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.660]   Now, before we get into the details,
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.740]   let's just get a bit of background foundation
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.980]   and context to what the passage is talking about this morning.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.100]   This passage happens in the middle
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.500]   of what is sometimes known as the Passion of Jesus.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.900]   Right, he is in his last hours before going to the cross.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.580]   And in these last hours, a lot has happened.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.940]   Jesus has spent some deeply personal
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.020]   and intimate time with his disciples.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.980]   He's washed their feet.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.340]   He's had their last supper with them.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.780]   He's prayed prayers of comfort over them
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.700]   and explained to them what's about to happen,
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.460]   that he is about to die.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.780]   But he's also explained to them the dangers
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.380]   that lie ahead for them, the hatred,
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.180]   the risk they would face as followers in the days to come.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.660]   He's been betrayed by one of his own disciples,
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.740]   arrested by a group of soldiers,
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.980]   abandoned then by the rest of them,
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.500]   and Peter, one of his closest friends,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.060]   has just denied him three times.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.660]   He's then been mocked, slapped, and judged by the high priest.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.740]   It's been a really difficult couple of hours.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.140]   And this is where the story picks back up.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.260]   And the Jewish leaders took him from the high priest,
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.380]   that's Caiaphas, to the place of the Roman governor.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.540]   By now, it was early morning,
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.940]   and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.540]   they did not enter the palace
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.260]   because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260]   So one thing we've seen throughout this series
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.100]   is consistently the tension
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.780]   between the religious leaders and Jesus.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.140]   Right, they're always trying to get him.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.340]   They're always out to attack him.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.620]   From the moment Jesus starts his ministry,
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.020]   many of the religious leaders are determined
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.780]   to do whatever they can to put a stop to him,
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.260]   right, to have him arrested, to ultimately kill him,
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.820]   stop this movement, you know, stop his followers,
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.420]   and just be rid of Jesus once and for all.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.500]   And in this moment, it seems like
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.660]   they're finally about to be successful.
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.900]   If there was a newspaper around at the time,
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.860]   the headline would have probably read something like,
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.460]   "Trouble-making false teacher finally apprehended."
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.980]   Right, this was going to be their big moment.
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.340]   By the way, sidestep,
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.660]   the slides for this series have been amazing.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.340]   I mean, Anshan has been our designer,
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.020]   and I've just really appreciated the creativity
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.060]   she's put behind the slides.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.180]   So Anshan, if you're out there, if you're listening,
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.980]   thank you for your creativity
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.940]   to help bring these messages alive.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.820]   But this would have been the title, right?
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.500]   They finally find Jesus where they want him.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.580]   And Jesus finds himself under custody,
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.140]   face-to-face with a Roman governor.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.340]   Pilate, this was the man
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.180]   who had the authority to decide his fate.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.500]   And so from the perspective of the religious leaders,
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.940]   this was perfect.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.020]   They have Jesus exactly where they want him.
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.860]   Finally, he's going to get what he deserves.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.700]   Right, after all, this was the guy
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.820]   who flipped tables in the temple.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.260]   This was the guy who was constantly breaking Sabbath rules.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.180]   This was the guy who hung out with sinners and prostitutes,
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.860]   tax collectors, adulterers, Gentiles,
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.300]   all those kind of unclean people.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.940]   And worst of all, this was the man who lied
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.340]   because he claimed to be one with God.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.260]   They said he was out of his mind.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.140]   They said he was the prince of demons.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.900]   But this was far from the truth
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.660]   because the truth was that throughout his whole life,
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.020]   throughout his whole ministry, Jesus never sinned.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.580]   The truth was that these religious leaders
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.100]   were the ones who were unable to see the truth
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.100]   because they were so bound up and blinded
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.580]   by their own judgmental and hypocritical hearts.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.780]   You see, there's something really ironic happening here
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.420]   that John wants us to notice.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.580]   He tells us that the religious leaders
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.740]   wanted to avoid ceremonial uncleanness.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.820]   So that's why they didn't enter the palace
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.700]   because entering into a Gentile's home,
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.540]   which the Pilate was, would have made them unclean.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.340]   And because of that, they wouldn't have been able
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.380]   to eat the Passover.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.540]   So they didn't go in to meet with Pilate
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.540]   because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.700]   But do you see what's happening?
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.220]   Right, this Passover was one of the biggest celebrations
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.700]   in the Jewish calendar.
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.180]   Right, this is where the Israelites commemorate
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.420]   and celebrate God bringing them out of exodus,
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.460]   right, bringing them out of slavery into freedom.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.100]   And one of the key elements in the Passover in Egypt
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.580]   was when God asked them to sacrifice a lamb
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.100]   so that they would be kept safe
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.540]   and the angel of death would pass over the homes
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.060]   that had the mark of the blood of the lamb.
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.100]   And since then, after every Passover,
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.780]   lambs were slaughtered and sacrificed
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.060]   in memory of what God had done for his people.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.020]   So it's interesting, right?
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.260]   They wanted to be ceremonially clean,
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.660]   but at the same time in their hearts,
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.660]   they were planning to execute an innocent man.
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.620]   Right, in other words,
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.420]   they just wanted to look clean on the outside.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.740]   Inside though, they were planning for evil.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.100]   They were willing to lie,
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.540]   to throw out false accusations, to condemn,
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.140]   but at the same time claiming to want to worship God.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.100]   Right, they were doing exactly what Jesus saw in them
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.140]   in the first place.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:39.260]   Matthew 23, "Hypocrites, you are like whitewashed tombs,
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.340]   "which look beautiful on the outside,
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.860]   "but on the inside, full of the bones of the dead
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.300]   "and everything unclean.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.340]   "In the same way, on the outside,
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.300]   "you appear to people as righteous,
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.860]   "but inside, you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness."
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.500]   And here's the irony.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.060]   As the lambs were being prepared
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.940]   to be sacrificed in the temple for the Passover,
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.180]   they couldn't see that standing before them
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.420]   was the ultimate sacrifice,
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.900]   the most purest and innocent lamb without sin.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.140]   And this time, his sacrifice wasn't just
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.820]   gonna be leading the Israelites out of Egypt,
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.780]   but it was to lead the entire world
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.900]   out of sin and into freedom.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.180]   But they weren't able to see it.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.500]   See, hypocrisy is when we believe
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.780]   or claim to believe in the truth, but we live out a lie.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.820]   And this is something we all need to be careful of
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.260]   because it's a trap that any one of us
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.220]   can very easily fall into.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.860]   Right, we want to come to church,
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.660]   we want to worship God, enjoy Christian fellowship,
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.420]   serve in the community, and all these things
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.100]   are good and great, but as we do these things, church,
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.060]   we have to ask ourselves,
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.100]   are our hearts in the right place?
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.020]   Because it's really, really easy
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.020]   to look good on the outside.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.220]   Now, hopefully, most of us in this room
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.940]   aren't conspiring for murder
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.980]   and put innocent people to death, right?
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.700]   We're not going to that extreme.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.100]   But this doesn't mean it's something that we can ignore.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.540]   Because I think in our context,
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.420]   it works itself out in our everyday lives.
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.700]   And if we're not careful, I think we can very easily
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.940]   begin to live what I call a sort of like a double life, right?
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.980]   Doing whatever we want during the week,
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.340]   getting a spiritual high on Sunday,
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.580]   feeling a little bit of remorse,
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.780]   only to forget about it all again on Monday.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.140]   Rinse, repeat.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.220]   I know this 'cause my own experience was like this.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.660]   For many years of my life, I really felt as though
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.580]   I was living two separate identities, right?
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.980]   And church on Sunday, around my church friends,
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.860]   everyone thought I was doing great, right?
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.020]   I grew up in the church.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.540]   My third language is Christianese, okay?
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.860]   So anytime someone asks you,
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.700]   I knew exactly what to say.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.540]   Oh, how you doing?
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.340]   Oh, yes, you know, really plugged in to my small group.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.980]   I really got good at doing my QTs
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.020]   and all this kind of stuff, all those language.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.900]   I knew what people wanted to hear
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.100]   and I was able to pretend really, really well.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.700]   But I know in my heart, on the inside,
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.060]   and how I live my life, it was far from God.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.660]   And it was probably some of the most confusing
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.260]   and tiring seasons of my life.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.700]   And I thought I could keep it up,
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.700]   but in truth, I was living a lie.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.060]   Because the truth is,
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.620]   the truth is what Jesus is seeking
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.740]   is for people to worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.540]   And what Jesus is looking for
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.660]   is people who are willing to take a good look
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.660]   and do something about the log that is in their own eye.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.700]   What Jesus is looking for
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.580]   is people who are willing to cut off their hand
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.180]   if that's what it takes for them to stop sinning.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.700]   Not that we have to be perfect, right?
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.620]   It's not calling for that,
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.100]   but the only way scripture tells us
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.100]   that we can seek and find God
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.340]   is when we do so with all our heart.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.500]   So for some of us here,
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.380]   before we have a conversation with anyone else,
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.780]   maybe the first conversation you have to have today
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.300]   is with yourself.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.020]   Are you claiming to love Jesus
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.700]   with your words and appearance,
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.220]   but in reality, your heart is far from him?
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.220]   If this is you this morning, keep listening,
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.020]   because maybe this is a wake-up call,
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.300]   a reminder to find out what it means
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.380]   to truly follow Jesus.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.540]   So let's go back to the passage and see what it has to say.
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.100]   So Pilate came out and asked them,
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.260]   "What charges are you bringing against this man?
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.300]   "If we were not a criminal," they said,
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.940]   "we would not have handed him over to you."
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.060]   And Pilate said then,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.080]   "But take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.860]   "But we have no right to execute anyone," they objected.
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.900]   This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.080]   about the kind of death he was going to die.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.680]   Right, so since they're being stubborn
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.220]   and they won't go in, Pilate has to come out.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.480]   Now, Pilate, who was Pilate?
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.740]   Pilate was the governor of this area at the time,
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.460]   but he had a reputation for being a brute and a bully.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.260]   He had a reputation for being a man
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.540]   who wasn't afraid to use violence
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.620]   in order to bring order back into his jurisdiction.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.860]   And he was the one with the authority to execute someone.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.980]   It was the perfect opportunity.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.480]   But what exactly has Jesus done wrong?
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.980]   Pilate wants to know.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.580]   Right, what charges are you bringing against this man?
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.460]   Right, there's a legal procedure that needs to happen here
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.100]   before we sentence him to death.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.100]   And like we said, right, these people,
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.420]   the religious leaders believe Jesus as a blasphemer,
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.180]   one who dared to put himself with equal footing with God,
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.700]   breaker of rules, a false teacher, son of the devil,
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.420]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.660]   But Pilate doesn't care about these things, right?
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.180]   As far as he, in his mind,
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.860]   those things are just internal Jewish squabbles.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.040]   You just squash that yourself.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.180]   Don't bring me into this.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.540]   But they're insistent, and they say,
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.480]   "If he were not a criminal," they replied,
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.260]   "we would not have handed him over to you."
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.180]   So this is one of those classic answers
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.560]   that tries to answer the question
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   without really answering the question.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.060]   You know, it's like when you ask,
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.540]   when I ask my wife, "Hey, how much did that dress cost?"
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.360]   And she says something like, "Well, it was on sale."
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.840]   Right?
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.820]   Okay, that doesn't really tell me anything, okay?
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.260]   It's sort of what's happening here, right?
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.660]   They're trying to convince Pilate,
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.500]   hey, if we can convince Pilate
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.300]   that this guy really is a rebel rouser, right,
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.620]   this guy's a subvert of the Roman Empire, right,
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.540]   he's gonna threaten your rule,
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.380]   he's gonna bring instability to the province,
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.020]   then maybe we can get him to sign off with our evil plans.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.100]   Right, so this was the way they thought
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.060]   they were gonna convince Pilate,
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.420]   only they have no real evidence,
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.160]   so they just throw out something really general,
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.660]   like, oh yeah, this guy is a criminal.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:13.020]   Again, something very ironic is happening here.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.880]   See, ultimately, what the Pharisees
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.520]   are trying to convince Pilate of
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.080]   is that Jesus is treasonous, he's committing treason,
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.840]   he's going against Caesar himself,
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.120]   and he's gonna be a threat to this governor.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.060]   But as they were accusing Jesus of treason,
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.360]   they were also committing treason.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.280]   Only it wasn't the earthly government
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.180]   that they were going against,
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.920]   but it was a going against God himself.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.120]   But they're blind, they can't see it.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.540]   But there's also one other thing they're blind to.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.100]   You see, this whole time,
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.100]   religious leaders at the time think they're being sly.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.140]   They think they're being clever,
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.180]   they think that, you know, this is the perfect plan,
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.520]   they're carrying out.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.400]   But the truth is this.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.760]   The reality is that this, all this that's happening,
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.240]   took place to fulfill what Jesus had said
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.360]   about the kind of death he was going to die.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:20.480]   So, on the surface, it looks like Jesus is under arrest.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.440]   On the surface, it looks like his fate has been sealed,
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.400]   he's been stripped of his power.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.080]   On the surface, it looks as though Jesus is done for.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.160]   But the truth is, everyone involved in this story
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.840]   are just players living out,
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.760]   acting what God has already said.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.160]   They just don't realize it.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.820]   And the truth is, despite of what things look like,
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.680]   Jesus is in full control of the situation.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.960]   In fact, Jesus could have put a stop to this at any moment.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.640]   In Matthew, he says, in Matthew 26, he says,
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.960]   "Don't you think that I can't call on my Father
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.920]   "and at once, at my disposal,
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.680]   "more than 12 legions of angels would come to my side?
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.920]   "But then how would Scripture be fulfilled
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   "to say that it must happen this way?"
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:18.120]   In talking about death, also, Jesus had once said,
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.560]   just that Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness,
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.360]   so the Son of Man must be lifted up.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.880]   This is what Jesus was talking about,
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.560]   that it had to happen in this way.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.160]   Now, to understand this, we need to, again,
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.840]   go back to the Exodus.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.000]   In the Exodus, after the Israelites left Egypt
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.760]   and they were wandering out in the desert,
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.520]   the Israelites were constantly failing
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.140]   into the habit of complaining against God,
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.080]   complaining against Moses, turning to idols,
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.160]   saying things like, "Oh, it was so much better
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.180]   "when we were back in Egypt.
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.440]   "Why did you lead us out here to die in the wilderness?"
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.960]   And as a result, every now and then,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   God would have to send punishment to remind them
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.680]   of their wrongdoing in turning to idols
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.640]   and complaining against Him.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.360]   And one of the punishments that God sent
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.960]   was quite weird and quite unique.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.320]   He sent poisonous snakes into the camp,
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.960]   and people started getting bitten by these poisonous snakes
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.100]   and they would die.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.160]   And as this was happening,
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.280]   the Israelites would realize their sin,
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.600]   and once again, they called on God for help.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.760]   And in order to save them, God told Moses to do this.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.480]   He told Moses, "Make a snake and put it up on a pole.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.880]   "Anyone who is bitten can look at it and live."
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.320]   So then Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.960]   Then when anyone was bitten by a snake
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.800]   and looked at the bronze snake, they lived.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.160]   Jesus is living out this prophecy here
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.600]   because in the same way, Jesus knows that in a little while,
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.200]   like the bronze snake was gonna be hoisted up,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.040]   he too was gonna be hoisted up.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.520]   Only it wasn't on a bronze pole.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.120]   Jesus was gonna be hoisted up on the cross.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.440]   And just as the Israelites received life
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.720]   when they looked at the bronze snake in the desert,
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.520]   anyone who would look up toward Jesus on the cross
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.400]   and have faith in His healing would too receive life.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:19.600]   All this to say, none of this was happening by accident.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.320]   Pastor Promise talked about this last week,
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.680]   but I want it to really be dwelling in our minds, Church.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.960]   Remember this well.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   The truth is that Jesus is always in control.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.600]   Jesus is always in control.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.100]   Even as these men worked together
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.880]   to plot injustice and evil,
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.720]   God was gonna work all of this
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.280]   to bring about the destruction of sin and darkness.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.880]   Even what people planned for evil,
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.100]   God was gonna use it for good.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.240]   Excuse me, this is why Jesus is so confident
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.880]   as He continues to be grilled and to be questioned.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   He never wavers.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.640]   Pilate goes back inside the palace.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.920]   He summons Jesus and asks Him,
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.280]   "Are you the King of the Jews?
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.760]   "Is this your own idea?" asked Jesus.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.460]   "Or did others tell you about me?"
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.640]   "I'm not a Jew," Pilate replied.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.780]   "Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.480]   "What is it that you have done?"
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:19.900]   You know, when I read the Bible,
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.680]   sometimes I like to insert myself into the stories.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.440]   In this section of Scripture, I always wonder,
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.500]   what was Pilate thinking as he looked at Jesus?
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.800]   'Cause as he sees this man standing before him, right,
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.000]   Jesus at this point probably looking kind of feeble,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.640]   kind of weak, a man whose followers
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.280]   have left Him high and dry.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.000]   What possible, in what possible realm of imagination
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.300]   could this guy be a king?
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.060]   So what Pilate's really asking is this, right?
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.780]   Who are you?
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.940]   Who are you?
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.540]   People say you're this, people say you're that.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.360]   Who are you?
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.340]   Are you here to make trouble for me?
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.940]   Are you really gonna be a threat to my power?
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.780]   Who are you?
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.980]   Who is this man that's standing in front of me?
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:10.240]   And in true fashion, Jesus answers his question
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.940]   with another question.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.500]   "Is this your own idea?" Jesus says.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.740]   "Or did others tell you to talk about me?"
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.860]   You see, Jesus answers this way
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.900]   because I think he knows Pilate's heart.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:28.900]   In other words, as Pilate is asking Jesus, "Who are you?"
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.940]   Jesus is asking Pilate, "Do you really want to know?"
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.100]   Like, is that question really coming from your heart?
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.200]   Do you really want to know who I am?
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.300]   Because if you do, if Pilate is genuinely interested,
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.120]   like the woman at the well,
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.740]   like the woman caught in adultery,
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.300]   like the Canaanite woman,
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:54.300]   Jesus was ready to tell him who exactly he was.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.660]   And Pilate is being offered the same opportunity here.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.920]   But let me also turn this question to us this morning.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.500]   Maybe it's a question we have to ask ourselves.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.540]   Do you know who Jesus is?
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.460]   Have you really asked that question?
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.560]   Jesus, who are you?
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.240]   And in your thinking about Jesus,
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.160]   maybe you see Jesus as a threat to your lifestyle.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.660]   Maybe it seems like Jesus is here
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.000]   to dictate how you live your life, right?
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.300]   To derail your plans, to threaten the authority you have
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.880]   over your own life right now.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.520]   And I know this is a stumbling block for many,
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.700]   to fully give the life to Jesus,
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.100]   because maybe you're in a good place.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.320]   Things are going well,
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.000]   and to invite Jesus into the equation
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.800]   seems like it's gonna be a threat to how you live your life.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.960]   But I'm gonna ask you again,
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.560]   because how you answer this question
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.200]   will 100% have an effect on how your life turns out,
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.280]   how you live your life.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.440]   Do you really want to know who Jesus is?
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.200]   Or are you seeking Jesus for some other reason?
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.440]   Maybe your parents force you to.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.720]   Maybe your spouse drags you to church every week
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.680]   and say, "Come on, let's just go."
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.940]   Okay, fine, I'll go.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.680]   Maybe there's someone you're interested in
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.320]   that's a Christian, and you're here just to,
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.220]   you know, trying to get to know them a little bit better.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.760]   Maybe you come to church 'cause you like the music,
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.000]   and we have a good kids program.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.080]   There could be a whole bunch of reasons
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.880]   why we come in the name to church and to seek Jesus.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.760]   And we love you, God loves you,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.280]   and we're so glad you're here.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.360]   But you're being challenged here today
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.640]   to check your hearts and motives,
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.240]   and be honest before God.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.440]   And if you've never seriously asked yourself this question,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.360]   or you're in a place where you need a good reminder,
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.880]   then perhaps today is the day you open up yourself to Him.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.640]   Let me ask us again.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   Do you really want to know who Jesus is?
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.360]   Well, let me try and help us out a little bit.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.640]   Because knowing the truth to this question,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.120]   like I said, is not only gonna change your life,
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.080]   it's gonna have the most amazing impact on your life,
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.520]   now and forevermore.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.600]   Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.540]   "If it were, my servants would fight
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.060]   "to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.160]   "But now my kingdom is from another place."
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.480]   Ah, you are a king then, said Pilate.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.840]   Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.200]   "In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.580]   "is to testify to the truth.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.160]   "Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:51.600]   Jesus finally tells Pilate plainly who He is.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.480]   Yes, I am a king.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.720]   I am a king.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.960]   Jesus has a kingdom, but His kingdom
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.440]   isn't like the sort of kingdom that He has in mind.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.400]   Jesus' kingdom is not like the kingdoms of this world.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.200]   His kingdom isn't one that's been secured by war,
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.040]   violence, political maneuvering, like earthly kingdoms are.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.840]   See, in that time, this is how kingdoms were won, right?
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.160]   Through violence, through power, through control,
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.240]   through defeating the enemy with your army.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   But Jesus has always been adamant
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.740]   that this is not what I'm about.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.380]   Not that He's not capable to fight.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.440]   We said just now He was very capable of that.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.480]   He could dominate easily in that way if He wanted to,
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.880]   but the kingship and kingdom of Jesus
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.140]   was gonna be like nothing this world has ever seen.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:41.040]   So how does this play in our context?
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.720]   We don't really live in land ruled by kings and queens,
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.440]   but other things do rule our lives and our culture,
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.880]   and other forces attempt to exert
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.580]   similar control over our lives.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:58.000]   So what do our kingdoms look like?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.760]   Our kingdoms are ruled by our own comfort,
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.460]   love of money and power and popularity.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.940]   Our kingdoms are dictated by our own selfish desires.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.760]   Our kingdoms appeal to our senses and say it's okay
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.960]   to follow the lust of your eyes, the desires of your flesh.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.800]   Our kingdoms tell us you only live once,
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.960]   so just go and do whatever you want to do.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.000]   Our kingdoms tell us that there are many ways
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.360]   to know the truth, that you are the captain of your destiny.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.500]   But Jesus says my kingdom is from a different place.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.040]   My kingdom functions differently
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.600]   because it's not of this world, it's for this world.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.520]   And my kingdom is here to show you
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.820]   that we don't have to be enslaved
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.400]   by these things that we just talked about.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.640]   Jesus says my kingdom is the kingdom of truth.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.600]   And because I am king,
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.240]   and because my kingdom is represented by truth,
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.400]   if you want to know the truth, listen to me.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.640]   "What is truth?" retorted Pilate.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.440]   With this, he went out.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.320]   Unfortunately, it was only a half-hearted rhetorical question
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.000]   and every time I get to this part in passage,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.880]   what is truth, I can't help but to feel
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.080]   like a twinge of sorrow for Pilate
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.600]   because here he is face to face with Jesus
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.520]   with every opportunity to find out the definition
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.680]   of what truth was and yet he fails to figure it out.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.920]   He fails to feel it.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.480]   He fails to experience it.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.080]   He fails to understand it.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.320]   He fails to believe in it and he walks away.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.720]   But like I said, today might be the day for you.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.280]   And if today you found yourself asking that question,
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.280]   if God's speaking to your heart, do not walk away
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.740]   because here's the truth.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.640]   The truth is this.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.920]   The truth is that you were not made for this kingdom,
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.480]   the kingdom of this world,
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.760]   but you were created for the kingdom of Jesus.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.400]   The truth is that Jesus loves you.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.320]   He doesn't condemn you for the things
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.400]   that you yourself are not proud of.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.920]   And the truth is Jesus wants to change your life
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.000]   for the better.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.040]   He wants to give you a testimony
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.040]   so that you can proclaim what he has done to other people.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.440]   The truth is that everyone, everyone is welcome
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.600]   in the family of God and God will never discriminate
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.480]   against you no matter who you are.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.920]   The truth is that God is with you.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.600]   Even as you have to go and fight through the most horrible
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.840]   and darkest of times, God is with you.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.040]   And the truth is God is also with us
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.240]   as we struggle through trials and temptations.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.780]   God is there to lead us and to guide us.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.040]   The truth is that God is with you through it all
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.920]   and that he works all things for your good.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.480]   And the truth is that Jesus came into this world
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:59.200]   because he loves you to die for your sins,
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.320]   to bear the punishment that we couldn't bear
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.160]   so we too can have a place in Jesus' kingdom.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.480]   The truth is church, there's only one way to live
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.040]   that will leave you truly fulfilled.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.740]   And that's through listening, obeying, and loving Jesus.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:21.680]   You see, when we come into a relationship with Jesus,
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.480]   you'll find the truth is not some sort
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.920]   of far-fetched philosophical concept.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.360]   It's not religious stories made up to scare you
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.040]   to behave better.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.840]   It's not the strongest opinion or the loudest voice.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.140]   It's not a method or a scientific formula.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:41.140]   The truth is Jesus is the way, the truth, and life.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:46.120]   And salvation and freedom are found in him and him alone.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.780]   There's a very precious gift that we have here, church.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.920]   If you know Jesus, you hold the truth within you.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.040]   And this is the truth that everyone is looking for.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.920]   Everyone needs to hear this.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.160]   And since we have it, we've been told to share it,
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.280]   to declare it, for conversations of truth
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.040]   is what this world truly needs.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.460]   So I pray if you know Jesus and you love Jesus
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.920]   and you're following the truth,
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.360]   continue to blow water in his name
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.980]   and let more people know about who he is.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:27.000]   But perhaps you're in this room today
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.920]   and his truth is something you once held near.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.120]   But for whatever reasons, you've lost sight of it.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.380]   And you started going on your own path.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.360]   And somewhere along the way, you've got a bit lost
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.620]   and it's hard for you to know what the truth is anymore.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.080]   Today might be the time for you to find it again,
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.680]   to believe again, to come back to the path
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.880]   that Jesus has set before you, to talk to Jesus again
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:02.240]   and hear that familiar voice of love calling out your name.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.980]   And maybe for some of us in this room,
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.380]   this is the first time you're hearing about this.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.160]   And maybe God's been speaking to you.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.240]   You felt something in your heart, in your mind,
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.200]   and you say, yes, actually, this is what
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.160]   I've been seeking for.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.400]   This is what I've been longing for.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.280]   This is what I've been needing in my whole life.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.000]   I've never heard it like this
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.440]   or I've never understood it like this,
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.880]   but I've heard Jesus speak to me
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.440]   and your heart is changing, your mind is changing.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.160]   I want you to know that that's not me speaking to you,
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.440]   that's Jesus.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.760]   Because he wants you to know the truth.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.960]   And he's been waiting, he's been ready,
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.320]   his love has been there for you all this time
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:54.160]   to bring you out of the darkness into the light,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.160]   to truly show you what your life on this earth is about,
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.200]   to give meaning and purpose and hope to your life.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.120]   So I wonder, Church, if we could just
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.720]   close our eyes for a second and just take a moment
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.500]   to think, where are you in this journey?
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.260]   You know, there's so many different things
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.660]   in this world that distract us
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:24.660]   and it is easy to stop putting our faith in other things.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:36.500]   It is easy to go astray and follow another voice instead.
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.740]   And it is a long journey sometimes
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.980]   of just seeking and seeking and trying to find the truth
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.780]   and the meaning of why am I on this earth?
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.180]   And is there a God that really loves me?
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.760]   (gentle music)
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.320]   Why am I on this earth?
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.040]   And is there a God that really loves me?
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:12.680]   Wherever we are in this journey,
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:20.000]   the true destination for every person
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.660]   that's ever walked on this earth,
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.880]   what you were created for was a life-giving,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   life-changing relationship with Jesus.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.160]   That's the only true way to live.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:44.080]   And so, Father, wherever our hearts are,
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.280]   I pray that you would lead us towards you.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.420]   (gentle music)
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:55.160]   And Jesus, I pray especially for those
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.280]   who are maybe making that decision for the first time today
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.200]   to lay everything else down,
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.680]   to lay down their own plans and things
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.440]   which they thought were right and they thought were true,
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:14.720]   that they would respond to your voice,
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.280]   they would listen to you and join the side of truth,
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.580]   join the side of life, join the side of light,
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.880]   join the side of love because that's where you are, Lord.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:30.080]   So, Jesus, I thank you that you are for us
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.320]   and not against us.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:39.240]   Help us to hear, to see, to follow the truth
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.100]   and that's you, Lord.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.560]   In your name we pray, amen.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.140]   (gentle music)
