1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Stop, think, don't do something stupid.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Sounds quite simple, right?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 We stop whatever we're doing,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 we take time to reflect and we think,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 and because we do that,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 we're able to make better decisions

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 that are good for ourselves,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 but also decisions that are better for other people.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 But I have a question.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Do we actually really do that?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Sometimes we do, but a lot of times we don't.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 And I want to share with you a time when I have not done that.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 So in 2010 to 2013,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I was living in Hong Kong,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 this was the first time around.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I was working for a church full-time,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 but I also studied full-time for three years.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And so the way I did my work was,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I worked, I came home, I studied, I went to bed.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And then I repeat the next day.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And then on the days that I was off,

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I also worked all day because that was the time

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 when I really could get my studies,

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 take care of my studies.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And so I just kept going in this brutal cycle,

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 and one thing I didn't do

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 was I didn't schedule in some rest.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I just, you know, went for it.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 But the problem was there were signs

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 that something was not going right that I ignored.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I don't know if you ever do that.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 So I started gaining a lot of weight.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 My back started hurting.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Friendships started to suffer

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 because the only way I could carry friendships was at work.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 But I still kept going.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I ignored the warning signs.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And so I ended up having so much back pain,

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I had a prolapsed disc

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 where I had this sharp pain running down my leg.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 So prolapsed disc, slipped disc.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I started to not be able to walk that far anymore.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And I suddenly had these sharp pains

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 where it didn't matter where I was,

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I had to sit down on the floor

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 and curl up in some position

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 so that I could deal with the pain.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And so we're talking Hong Kong streets.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Laying on the streets, curling up in a position

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 so I wasn't in pain.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And as you know, Hong Kong streets are not very clean.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 So not a great place to do that.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 But I kept going, right?

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And that was not the only thing that suffered.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 My friendship suffered

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 and also my relationship with God suffered as well.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Because when you keep going and going and going

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 and you're just grinding

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 and you're in this brutal cycle of work without rest,

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 it's hard to actually enjoy

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 and be in a relationship with God

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 and to hear from God.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And so spiritually I was also dry

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 a lot of the times during that time period.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 But I'm sure that I'm not the only one who does it.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I'm sure that I'm not the only one

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 whose life has started to spin out of control

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 because of a relentless schedule.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 As Benedict already mentioned,

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 the city can be relentless in terms of what it demands of you.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Maybe it's your workplace

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 where you have a job,

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 your colleague quits,

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 suddenly you need to do your colleague's work.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But guess what?

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 They're not hiring somebody to replace your colleague.

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Boo!

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Right? Boo!

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Well, so suddenly you have this crushing workload

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 that you need to carry.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Or maybe, I just learned this, I'm very proud of this,

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 the 9-9-6 work culture.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 9am to 9pm, six days a week.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Maybe that is your schedule.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And beyond that,

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 there's not much time for anything else.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Then sometimes also work doesn't just take place in a workplace.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Work also takes place at home.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 So there might be demands at home.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 So there's a lot of things that can make our schedule

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 quite brutal, quite relentless.

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And if we don't have times of rest,

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 this relentless schedule starts crushing us.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And it comes at a high cost.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And there's pressures that work two ways.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 There's internal pressure and there's external pressure.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 External pressure is what I was describing with our jobs

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 and our circumstances, maybe at home.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 But then there's the internal pressure as well.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And that's actually striving.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Where we're trying to be someone, please someone,

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 be accepted by someone.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And there's something within us that makes us feel like

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 we cannot relax.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Because if I relax, I'm not going to pass my studies.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 If I relax, I'm not going to be able to hold this degree.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 So I always need to work.

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I just need to keep going.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I need to keep pushing.

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And so there are these external and internal forces

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 that we experience.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Is anyone tired by now?

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Talking about not resting?

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I feel kind of tired.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 But what I want to do with you,

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 I want to explore with you a question.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And that's this.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 How can we cultivate a life that is marked by rest

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 and not striving and exhaustion?

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 How do you do that?

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And what does God's word have to say to us about that?

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Like how can God speak into our life about this topic?

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 So we're going to be in Genesis chapter 1 and 2 today.

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Again, actually mainly in chapter 2.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And we're going to explore what that has to say.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Now the first Sunday of the Stewarding Our Life sermon series,

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 I think four or five weeks ago,

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 we talked about that we are created in God's image.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And that part of what it means to be created in God's image

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 is that we are rulers, we are cultivators,

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 we image God in this creative work,

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 and we're actually created for good work.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 We're created to cultivate, to make culture,

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 to organize the structure,

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 to contribute to the flourishing and the thriving

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 of the world in general and of people specifically.

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And that when we do that,

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 that's what we are partially created for.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 We can be fully human, fully who God has made us to be.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And if we're not able to do that, we suffer.

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And we've experienced that.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I shared about a time of unemployment in my life

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 that was difficult, even mentally, for me.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 But today we're going to look at the other side of it,

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 because work is not the only thing that we're meant to do

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 or that we're created for.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 We're also created for rest and enjoyment.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And so let me take you to Genesis 2,

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 where starting in verse 1, it says this.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 This is day 7 of creation, by the way.

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 It says this,

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 "Thus the heavens and the earth were completed

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 in all their vast array.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 By the seventh day, God had finished the work

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 he had been doing."

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 So on the seventh day, he rested from all his work.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 "Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy,

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 because on it he rested from all the work of creating

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 that he had done."

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So this is the beginning of the Bible,

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 and it talks about God working

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 and then God seizing and resting.

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And I want to explore these few verses with you

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 by three words.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And that's rested, blessed, and made holy.

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So let me start with rested.

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 So God created the world six days,

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 and he looked at it, it was very good,

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 and then he rested.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Now the word rest is Shabbat,

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 and Shabbat, that's also where we get the word Sabbath from.

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 It means to rest, to stop, to cease, to desist,

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 to celebrate, to be completed.

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So God had completed his work, and he stopped.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And he paused.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 So that's the first thing.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 God just didn't keep relentlessly going.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 He enjoyed what he had made.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 The second thing is blessed, Barach.

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Now this is interesting because this is the third time

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 in the creation narrative that God blessed something.

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 First he blesses living creatures.

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Then God blesses human beings.

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And he blesses them because he wants them to multiply,

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 to flourish, to thrive.

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And now thirdly, he blesses a day.

187
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Now that's kind of strange.

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 It's like living creatures, people,

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 but now he blesses a day.

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 What in the world does that mean?

191
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 It means that God, that this day is fruitful,

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 that there is something that he does when we observe that,

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 that it bears fruit in our lives.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 There's a blessing over it that God has spoken over time

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 that when we observe it, we experience the fruitfulness

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 of this day.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 So God spoke a blessing over it, and he made the day fruitful.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Interesting, right?

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Because a lot of times the only way we feel like it's fruitful

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 is if we're productive and get stuff done.

201
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 But God makes a day of rest fruitful.

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 He blessed it.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And then the third word is made holy, Kedesh.

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And so that means to set apart, to consecrate, to make holy.

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Now that's also an interesting concept.

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 How can you make a day holy?

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Like we might expect a site to be holy,

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 that there's a holy mountain or a holy person,

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 but for a day to be holy.

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Now holy means basically to be set apart.

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 So God has set apart this day for himself,

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 and he has made it holy.

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Now let me put all of this together.

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 What we see here from this in Genesis 1 and 2

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 is that in creating the world,

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 God establishes a pattern of work and rest for human beings

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 that is essential for human flourishing.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Six days we work, one day we rest.

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 When we observe that rhythm, we can flourish.

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 When we ignore it, it's like going against a grain of wood.

221
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 You get splinters.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 There's a price to pay when we ignore it.

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 That's just generally part of the rhythm that God has established.

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 So that's the first thing.

225
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 But I want to follow this idea of rest in the scripture

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 through the Old Testament and then also the New Testament.

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 So how does it continue?

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Well, the next book of the Bible is the book of Exodus.

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And there God actually commands his people to observe the Sabbath,

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 to keep the seventh day holy.

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And this happens after the Exodus.

232
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 So God has powerfully delivered Israel out of slavery.

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And then they're at Mount Sinai,

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 and God reveals through the Ten Commandments

235
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 part of who he wants his people to be,

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 how they can flourish and thrive,

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 how they can be a society that has a character that honors God.

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And part of that is the Sabbath and observance of that day.

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So let me read that to you.

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 It's in Exodus 20, starting in verse 8, it says this.

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Six days you shall labor and do all your work.

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 But the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord your God.

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 On it you shall not do any work,

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 neither you nor your son or daughter,

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 nor your male or female servant,

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns."

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I'm just going to pause you for a second.

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I love that this applies to everyone, right?

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 This is not just for the Israelites.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 This is God's principle for everyone.

252
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from,

253
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 what your role is.

254
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 This is for everyone.

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 But let's continue in verse 11.

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 "For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth,

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 the sea and all that is in them.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 But he rested on the seventh day.

259
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."

260
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 So the Sabbath command in this first time

261
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 that the Ten Commandments are or appear in the Bible,

262
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 it is rooted, it is grounded in God's creation narrative.

263
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 You know, that God worked and God rested,

264
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 and therefore you are to work and you are also meant to rest.

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 But there is actually a second time

266
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 where God gives the Ten Commandments.

267
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And this is Moses shares them to a new generation.

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And there's a difference.

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 He roots the reason for why Israel is supposed to observe the Sabbath

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 in a different reason.

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Let me show you.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Deuteronomy 5, verse 15, it says this.

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 "Remember that you were slaves in Egypt,

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 and that the Lord your God brought you out of there

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 to observe the Sabbath day."

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Interesting.

279
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 So here Moses grounds the observance of the Sabbath

280
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 in the Exodus story, not the creation story.

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And the Exodus story is a redemption story

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 because remember, the Israelites, they were slaves in Egypt.

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 They had a relentless schedule.

284
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 They had to work every day.

285
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 There was no break.

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 They had a brick-making quota for the Egyptian building project

287
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 that was brutal.

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 They had to go get their own straw for making bricks.

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And so God is saying, "I have delivered you.

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I have set you free.

291
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 You have now freedom.

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And when you're a free person, you rest.

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 You don't just keep going like when you were enslaved in Egypt."

294
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And it's interesting because when you look at Deuteronomy 5, verse 15,

295
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 it says, "Remember that you were slaves."

296
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 You were.

297
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 You're not anymore.

298
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And so Israel needed to remember that,

299
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 and they needed to live in this freedom that God had given them.

300
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 You're no longer under Pharaoh's rule.

301
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 You're under God's rule.

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 You're no longer under a tyrant's rule.

303
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 You're under loving God's rule.

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So observe the Sabbath and rest.

305
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Now, the Sabbath was a sign of the covenant

306
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 that God had made between Israel and himself.

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And so observing it was a way of keeping the covenant.

308
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 So they were commanded to do it.

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 They had to do it.

310
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 But both the creation story and the Exodus story,

311
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 they shape how the Sabbath was lived out.

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So first, the creation story, on the one hand,

313
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 reminds Israel that God is the ultimate creator,

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 that he is the ultimate provider,

315
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 and all source of blessing comes from him.

316
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And that means because God is the source of our blessings,

317
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 not our own striving and work,

318
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 that means we can actually afford to rest and cease and start working

319
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 because he will provide.

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And then on the other hand, the Exodus story reminds Israel

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 that they are beloved, redeemed children of God.

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 It reminds them that they're supposed to leave Egypt behind.

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 You do not have to work.

324
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 You don't have to exist in this way anymore,

325
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 that the surrounding culture is existing.

326
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 I want you to live differently.

327
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And so you're going to cease and you're going to pause.

328
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And isn't that interesting because I feel like for us,

329
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 we have pressure from our surrounding culture, right,

330
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 to just keep going, to keep working, to produce more.

331
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And sometimes that's pressure from within us,

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 but it's also pressure from around us.

333
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 So actually observing rest as a powerful declaration in faith in God

334
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 that he provides, that I am his, that I am free,

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 and I do not need to give in to the tyranny of this relentless,

336
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 restless schedule that is placed on us.

337
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And so this is what the Sabbath practice of Israel is rooted in.

338
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 So let's fast forward to the New Testament.

339
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And here that could be a lot that could be said,

340
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 and I'm going to keep it quite simple and to the point.

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 I'm going to address the question,

342
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 do Christians still need to observe the Sabbath?

343
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And the quick answer is no, but I want to explain.

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And I also want to point out that the creation rhythm that God has established

345
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 of work and rest is still that rhythm, and if we ignore it, it impacts us.

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 So that's very important.

347
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 So I just want to say that straight away.

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 There is blessing on resting, and it is fruitful when we rest.

349
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 But we don't have to observe the Sabbath like Israel had to.

350
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And so I want to take you to one of Paul's writings in Colossians 2, 16.

351
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 He says this, "Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink

352
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 or with regard to religious festivals, a new moon, celebration of a Sabbath day.

353
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 These are a shadow of the things that were to come.

354
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 The reality, however, is found in Christ."

355
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Now what does this mean?

356
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Well, it points to that Christ has fulfilled what the Sabbath points to.

357
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 The Sabbath was a sign pointing forward, a weekly reminder

358
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 that our own work can never save us.

359
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 It can never fully give us rest.

360
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 It can never fully make us whole.

361
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 And that this rest and this wholeness is alone found in Christ,

362
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 and Christ has fulfilled that.

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 And so when we're anxious and striving people and we can't stop,

364
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 we find rest in Jesus because our striving doesn't really bring us security.

365
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 It doesn't really bring us wholeness that we think it will.

366
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 We think it will establish us.

367
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 We think that we can save ourselves in essence through our efforts.

368
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 We're going to make ourselves whole by trying harder,

369
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 by working harder, by positioning ourselves better,

370
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 but we never fully arrive.

371
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 But in Jesus, there are true rest and wholeness is found.

372
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 He gives us our identity.

373
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 You are beloved children, sons and daughters of God,

374
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 and you can find rest in that.

375
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 It's not rest in your striving, which we think will bring us that security and rest,

376
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 but it never does.

377
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 You never arrive, but you can find rest in Christ.

378
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 So that's what Paul is saying, that Sabbath was a shadow

379
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 and was observant that pointed towards the ultimate rest,

380
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 which is found only in Christ Jesus.

381
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And that is part of the gospel message,

382
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 that when we come to Jesus, we can experience this peace

383
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 and we can experience this rest over our striving, over what wears us out.

384
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 But all of this brings me back to this question I asked at the beginning of the message.

385
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 How can we cultivate a life that is marked by rest and not striving and exhaustion?

386
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 What does that look like?

387
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 How do we actually break this cycle that so many of us find ourselves in,

388
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 that many of us here today are stuck in?

389
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 How can we start seeing that changed?

390
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Well, for one, we learn from the creation story

391
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 that there is this rhythm that God has established of work and rest,

392
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 and that when we observe it, that there is blessing in that.

393
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 So that's always true.

394
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And if we go against that, we will pay a price for that.

395
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 But then we also see that through Jesus, there is this greater rest.

396
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 In him, in Galatians 5.15, it says this,

397
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 that it is for freedom that Christ has set us free.

398
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Stand firm then and do not let yourself be burned again by the yoke of slavery.

399
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Christ has set you free for freedom.

400
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 You no longer need to live this way.

401
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Live as free people, not as enslaved people.

402
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And this is still true for us Christians.

403
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Yes, in Jesus there is rest when we come to know him, and there is peace.

404
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 But then we need to learn to live in this rest, and it doesn't automatically happen.

405
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 We can still be restless, anxious, worn out, even as Christians.

406
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 So again, how do we cultivate this life of peace and rest and wholeness?

407
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 What does that look like?

408
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Where do we start?

409
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Well, the first thing is we actually need a schedule, a time.

410
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Is that a German thing? Schedule time?

411
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Got to go to a schedule, let me look.

412
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 But you somehow have to put it in your schedule.

413
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 If you do it officially, on your phone, or in your planner, or mentally,

414
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 however you do that, you actually need a schedule time of rest.

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Now for a lot of us, of course it's amazing if you can take a whole day

416
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 and somehow figure out how to do that.

417
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Praise God that you're able to do that.

418
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 And some people are. Others struggle with that, with the demands that are on them.

419
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 So what I want to encourage you is actually just start somewhere.

420
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 This is not about perfection. Start somewhere.

421
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 If you can carve out two, three hours, maybe one hour is like sleeping in longer,

422
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 and then there's two hours of drawing close to God, put that in your schedule.

423
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And start doing that regularly.

424
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 So the first thing is we need to schedule it.

425
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Second, spend unhurried time with God.

426
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 So this is where observing rest in the way that Scripture encourages

427
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 is different from taking time off.

428
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Time off is like I'm watching Netflix, I'm just laying in bed, doing whatever.

429
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 But when we want to cultivate this life of rest, it does take time,

430
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 spending time in a relationship with God.

431
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 So we need to have unhurried time with God.

432
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Now what might this look like?

433
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 I think this looks quite different for different people.

434
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I'm a little bit hesitant to say this is exactly what you need to do.

435
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 But I'll just share what I do and some things that I know people do,

436
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 and I hope you can decide what will be helpful for you.

437
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 So for me, what I do is I need about an hour and a half time.

438
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 I don't necessarily use that hour and a half, but I just need that time

439
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 because otherwise it's not unhurried time.

440
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Because, for example, in the mornings when I do my devotions,

441
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 a lot of times I'm rushed.

442
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 It is unhurried time, even if I try for it not to be.

443
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 So when I want to set aside this time to really rest and spend time with God,

444
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 I need unhurried time.

445
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 So I might spend 45 minutes, maybe an hour, maybe a little bit longer with God,

446
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 but I just have the freedom because there's a margin.

447
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 And then in that time I might worship, I read Scripture,

448
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I pray over Scripture, I journal, I pray for you, I pray for my family.

449
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And so those are like some of the components that are part of my unhurried time with God.

450
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 But for you, maybe it's like prayer walking.

451
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Maybe you're like a person who connects outside with God,

452
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 and you're walking out in nature, and you're praying outside in that way,

453
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 and you're worshiping.

454
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 So whatever is helpful to you, do that, to spend unhurried time with God.

455
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Does that make sense?

456
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 All right, third one.

457
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And this is be renewed.

458
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Now, this is not something that we do.

459
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 This is something that the Spirit of God does.

460
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 But when we schedule a time of rest, when we spend unhurried time with God,

461
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 God does renew us and refresh us.

462
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Remember earlier there's just blessing over when we have time of rest.

463
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Well, God blesses that time.

464
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 He makes it fruitful.

465
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And he wants this time to bear fruit in your life.

466
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And so there's two main ways that I believe that God wants to make this time fruitful.

467
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Or let me put it this way, two ways that I want to share.

468
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 The first one is this.

469
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 When we spend time in this intimacy with God, God actually reminds us of who he is.

470
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 That he is the loving father.

471
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 He is redeemer.

472
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 He's rescuer.

473
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 He's creator.

474
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 He's almighty and powerful.

475
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And it puts God back into focus because he gets out of focus when we're rushing around

476
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 and we're spinning like crazy and we lose focus of who God is.

477
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And so it puts God back into focus and reminds us of who he is

478
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 and it gives us perspective on all of our lives, on all the stuff that's going on.

479
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And I have this quote from John Oswald that I want to share with you.

480
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 He says this, "If we make God our focus, knowing he, the transcendent holy one, is in control of all things,

481
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 then we can live in confidence in the sanctuary of his power and his love."

482
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And I love this.

483
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 When we make God our focus, we can be confident and we can live in his place

484
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 in the sanctuary, this peace of rest of his power and his love.

485
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And that means that as we make God our focus, we can start setting aside our anxieties

486
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 and replace it with an awareness of the presence of God.

487
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 That God is with us.

488
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 You are not alone.

489
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 He is right by your side.

490
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 That he loves you and that he is powerful.

491
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 He has power above everything.

492
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And so regardless of what challenge you're facing, regardless of what circumstances you're facing,

493
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 you can live in the sanctuary of his power and his love.

494
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 And I think that's a beautiful description of rest.

495
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 That it doesn't matter where you're walking around, doesn't matter what circumstance you're in,

496
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 you can live in the sanctuary of his power and his love because you know him

497
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 and because he is the focus and the center of your life.

498
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Isn't that a beautiful picture? Am I the only one?

499
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Yeah.

500
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 So that's the first thing.

501
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 When we spend this time with God, we are renewed through that.

502
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 But then that's not the only thing.

503
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 We're also reminded of who we are.

504
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Now the external and internal pressures, they try to tell us all sorts of things about who we are.

505
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 They try to tell you, you are not enough.

506
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 You're not producing enough.

507
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 If you only work a little bit more, if you only try a little bit harder, maybe one day you'll be okay.

508
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 That's what internal, external pressure tells us.

509
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 But when we spend our time with God, he speaks over you.

510
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 You are my beloved child.

511
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 You are my son, my daughter with whom I am well pleased.

512
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And so when we know our identity, our identity is not found in striving and accomplishing things

513
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 and getting a million things done and being 10% more productive than last week

514
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 and meeting more KPIs.

515
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 God also just powerfully allows us to rest in our identity that he gives us.

516
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Not that other people try to give us or that we think we can somehow earn, but that's never stable.

517
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And so he renews you through that.

518
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 And I believe he is speaking that over some of you even right now,

519
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 just reminding you of your identity, that you are loved.

520
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 You're not your performance or your lack of your performance.

521
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 You are a beloved child of God.

522
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And he wants you to be able to find rest and peace in your identity in him.

523
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And then, of course, a final blessing of this renewal is just simply we get to enjoy,

524
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 and that's a grace blessing, just be in relationship with God.

525
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 We get to enjoy our relationship with God.

526
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Now, so how can we respond to this message?

527
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 How can we start living in a sanctuary of his power and his love?

528
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Well, for one, you actually need to set aside time to rest and to spend unhurried time with God.

529
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 So if you're not do that and you just keep doing what you're doing,

530
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 your life's going to continue just to spin out of control,

531
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 and there's going to be consequences, just like there was with me, right?

532
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Back problem, sitting on streets, laying on streets of Hong Kong,

533
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 relationship problems, marriage problems,

534
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 because you keep ignoring those things and just keep going in that cycle.

535
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 So you need to schedule a time to rest and to connect with God.

536
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 So right now, maybe that's the thing that you need to do.

537
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 So when are you going to do it this week?

538
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 So take out your calendar and actually put it in.

539
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Find that time, find that moment.

540
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Maybe it's during the week, maybe it's in the weekend.

541
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 So that's for some of us what we need to do.

542
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 But for others of us, rest is found in Jesus.

543
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 So for one, all of us need to come to Jesus.

544
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 But I want to right now speak specifically to those of you who actually don't know Jesus fully yet.

545
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And I want to give an opportunity to actually come to Jesus and to become a Christian.

546
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 And it's easy to come to church.

547
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Sometimes we think coming to church makes us a Christian.

548
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Coming to church doesn't make you a Christian.

549
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Sometimes we grow up in a Christian country, and we feel like I'm a Christian because I grew up in this country.

550
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Growing up in a Christian country doesn't make you a Christian.

551
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Growing up in a Christian family does not make you a Christian.

552
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 There comes this point in our lives where we have to make our own decision.

553
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Am I going to receive Jesus into my heart?

554
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Or am I going to cross that line?

555
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 And so I want to give that opportunity to do that right now.

556
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just in a simple way, I'm going to do the ABC, just an acronym.

557
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 You know, we admit that we're sinners, that we're broken people, that we have this need for Jesus for His forgiveness.

558
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Believe that Jesus is Savior and Redeemer and Lord, that He died, that He rose.

559
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 And then finally confess, confess that Jesus is your Lord.

560
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Not somebody else's, not your neighbor's, but your Lord.

561
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 And so I'm going to lead you in a prayer.

562
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 You can quietly pray it along in your heart, and you can become a Christian and take that step.

563
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 So let me do this right now for us.

564
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I want to invite the worship team to come up as well.

565
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Jesus, thank you so much that you love me.

566
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 I admit that I am a sinner, that I have done things that I know are wrong.

567
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 That I've sinned against you, and I've sinned against other people.

568
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Please forgive me.

569
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And Jesus, I will now place my faith in you.

570
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 I believe that you died on the cross for my sins, and that you rose again so that I can have new life and be forgiven.

571
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 And so Jesus, I invite you in my heart right now.

572
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 I confess that you are my Lord and my Savior.

573
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Will you come into my life?

574
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Will you fill me with your Holy Spirit?

575
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And I pray this in your name, Jesus.

576
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 And all God's people said, Amen.

577
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Now if you've prayed this prayer, you know, God's Word says that if we can confess with our tongue that Jesus Christ is Lord, we are saved.

578
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 You have crossed over.

579
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Now we still need to learn what that means, what it means to follow Jesus, and that's what we're here for as a community.

580
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 But I would love to, if you've taken that step, I would love to hear from you about it, so I can encourage you and walk with you in that.

581
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 So right now I want to invite all of us to stand, and I actually want to pray over all of us.

582
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 So if you've been exhausted and you're tired, whether that's just through striving or maybe your external pressure,

583
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 I just want to invite you to stretch out your hands just as a symbol of just wanting to receive from God.

584
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 I just want to pray over you.

585
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 Jesus, thank you so much that you are the one in whom we truly find rest.

586
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 Thank you that you love every single person here, that you know every single person, you know what's going on, you know the challenges that they're facing.

587
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 And I just pray right now that you will come, that you will meet them, that you release the peace of God over every single heart right now.

588
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 That you renew us and refresh us with your Holy Spirit.

589
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Lord, I also pray for change.

590
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 I pray for freedom, that you have set us free to live a different life, not a life of slavery anymore, but a life of freedom in you.

591
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 So I pray if striving has been what's been driving us, Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus that the striving is broken right now.

592
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 Thank you, Jesus.

593
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 So I pray, Lord, that you make us a community that rests in you, that knows your peace, that knows your wholeness, that you restore us, that you refresh us and renew us.

594
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 And that we can live differently because we know you.

595
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 So we thank you, Jesus, for your work that you are doing right now.

596
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Thank you, Jesus.

597
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 And I pray all that in your name.

598
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Amen.

599
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Amen.

600
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 Let's worship church.

601
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,580
 (gentle music)
