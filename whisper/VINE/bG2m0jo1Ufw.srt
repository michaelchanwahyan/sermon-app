1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
 We look forward to it, we thank you for it in Jesus' name.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,300
 Amen.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,840
 - Amen, thank you, Promise.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,740
 And welcome to everybody.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,700
 If you're joining us online, welcome to you too.

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,860
 And out in the overflow, we're glad

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,580
 that everybody's here this morning.

8
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,180
 I do, I have problems remembering things.

9
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,700
 It was encounters with God, but for some reason

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,520
 I keep on saying encountering God.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,460
 Last, a couple weeks ago when I was preaching,

12
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,700
 kept on saying persevere instead of,

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,260
 I have that anyway, okay, forget about it, okay.

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,580
 I have many problems, okay,

15
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,260
 is that what I'm trying to say, okay.

16
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,140
 One particular, apart from the obvious, right,

17
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,140
 things I am working to improve about myself, okay.

18
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,700
 There's honestly, there's one thing,

19
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,980
 one area that I see that I really don't like,

20
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,820
 but I'm trying to improve, okay.

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,440
 And this problem is this.

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,600
 My problem is that every time someone starts

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,460
 giving me instructions or directions,

24
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,100
 my brain shuts down, okay.

25
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,300
 Now you could see it's like a male thing, okay.

26
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,420
 I don't know, okay.

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,340
 I don't do it on purpose, okay, I don't think I do,

28
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,540
 but it's weird because, you know,

29
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,420
 I think I'm a relatively good listener.

30
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,100
 I like to be helpful, I like people.

31
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,680
 I generally think I'm quite teachable.

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,900
 You can ask Carla and my colleagues if that's the case,

33
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,460
 all right, but for whatever reason,

34
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,640
 when someone starts describing something to me,

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,400
 or especially when it comes to directions,

36
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,620
 how to get somewhere, or it's an instruction book

37
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,100
 or a recipe, I suddenly stop listening to words,

38
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,620
 like the words just don't make sense,

39
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,260
 and it all sounds like waka, waka, waka, waka, right,

40
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,180
 and my brain goes off.

41
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,700
 You know those dreamlands when people go off to

42
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,180
 in the movies, like, (imitates dream land)

43
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,560
 I'm thinking about like paddling on the ocean

44
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,460
 or whatever else, right.

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,640
 Anything but listening to the instructions.

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,920
 Now the most messed up thing is sometimes I'm the one

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,140
 that asks for the instruction in the first place, right.

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,020
 Even then, my brain shuts down, right.

49
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,540
 But, okay, the skill, I'm not sure if you could call it

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,500
 a skill, right, the trick is I look like I'm engaged.

51
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,240
 Okay, so I'll be nodding my head, mm-hmm, yep, wow,

52
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,600
 that's interesting, wow, wow, that's wild, you know.

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,940
 Also works when you want to pretend to be listening

54
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,140
 to your significant other and they're saying things,

55
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,740
 you know, it's like, wow, mm, that's crazy, right.

56
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,240
 Those kind of phrases, okay.

57
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,180
 But if you ask me, like, what did that person just say,

58
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,420
 or you know, what were the instructions?

59
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,300
 If you wanted me to repeat that, forget about it, okay.

60
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,260
 Now it's kind of funny sometimes, but I think for me,

61
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,860
 this really gets me in trouble when I start hearing

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,240
 from God, 'cause many times when I talk to God,

63
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,500
 I'm talking to God because I feel like I need

64
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,820
 some sort of guidance, some sort of instruction.

65
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,380
 But then my problem is, okay, when God responds

66
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,460
 and he answers, when he's giving me good instruction

67
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,460
 in what to do, am I willing to listen and to obey?

68
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,980
 And in our journey, in this series of encountering God

69
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,740
 or encounters with God, we are looking at today

70
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,500
 the story of Joshua.

71
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,860
 And if I could turn up, if I could sum up the story

72
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,620
 of Joshua in just one phrase, it would be this.

73
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,820
 Remember the importance of obedience.

74
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,080
 So let's take a look at the story and see what it has to say.

75
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,180
 Now the story of Joshua sort of serves as a turning point

76
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,040
 in the lives of the Israelites.

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,460
 Last week, Promise talked to us about Jacob

78
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,940
 and how God changed Jacob's life, right?

79
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,940
 He wrestled with Jacob and he changes his name to Israel.

80
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,740
 Well now, Jacob, aka Israel, then goes on to have 12 sons

81
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,380
 and one daughter.

82
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,260
 And the sons go on to establish what becomes known

83
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,660
 as the 12 tribes of Israel.

84
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,860
 And so the beginnings of a new nation

85
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,720
 are already starting to be formed, right?

86
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,700
 Now through one of Jacob's sons, Joseph,

87
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,020
 they all end up in the land of Egypt.

88
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,340
 But it's interesting because Egypt is not their land.

89
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,820
 They're starting to become a nation,

90
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,460
 the great big people group,

91
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,400
 but they don't have their own land.

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,160
 That's been promised to them ever since Abraham,

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,660
 but God is yet to fulfill this promise.

94
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,540
 And so the Israelites start to grow and prosper in Egypt,

95
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,640
 but the Pharaoh then becomes threatened

96
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,900
 and decides to take them into slavery, right?

97
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,980
 This group of people, they're growing,

98
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,180
 they're not our own people.

99
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,920
 We need to keep this under control.

100
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,340
 And so the Israelites get taken into captivity,

101
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,100
 into slavery.

102
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,700
 And whilst they're in slavery, they cry out to God for help.

103
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
 They cry out to God, you know, where are your promises?

104
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,980
 Where are you, Lord?

105
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,740
 And so God raises and sends Moses

106
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,060
 to deliver them out of slavery.

107
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,020
 So Moses leads the Israelites out of Egypt

108
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,260
 into freedom through the wilderness.

109
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,560
 And through the time in the wilderness,

110
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,140
 they continue to see God work and provide for them

111
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,060
 in miraculous ways.

112
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,520
 Things like parting the Red Sea,

113
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,260
 giving them the daily bread and meat,

114
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,140
 making water gush out from the rocks.

115
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,340
 He helps them defeat the enemies around them

116
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,140
 when they're attacked.

117
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,780
 But the most important thing God does with them at this time

118
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,380
 is to make a covenant.

119
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,940
 And within this covenant, there are rules,

120
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,620
 instructions, and directions on how to live their lives

121
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,080
 so they can live as an example to the nations around them

122
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,200
 and demonstrate what God is like.

123
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,280
 This is their calling, right?

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,440
 You're God's chosen people set apart.

125
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,080
 This is how then I want you to live as my people.

126
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,520
 This is what the covenant is about.

127
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,400
 And so all this time, they're slowly stumbling their way

128
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
 towards the promised land

129
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,920
 where God will eventually settle them.

130
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,880
 Now Moses, right, their leader at the time, however,

131
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,860
 is not able to lead the Israelites into the promised land.

132
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,900
 He actually dies just before he can see it happen.

133
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,140
 And so the book of Joshua starts as the Israelites

134
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,500
 are on the cusp of entering the new land,

135
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,620
 entering this promised land that God has given to them,

136
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,540
 and Joshua takes up the mantle

137
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,660
 to become Israel's new leader.

138
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,500
 This is the turning point.

139
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,820
 Now put yourself in Joshua's shoes for a minute.

140
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,780
 Think about, excuse me,

141
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,940
 think about what this moment has, sorry, Bex,

142
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,320
 what this moment must have been, okay?

143
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,720
 Again, if you hear, if you remember the story,

144
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,320
 Joshua had actually seen the promised land before.

145
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,520
 Way back in the day when Joshua was a younger man,

146
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,720
 he was a spy sent by Moses along with 11 other spies

147
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,800
 to check out the promised land.

148
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,680
 Now if you know the story, right, the 12 spies come back,

149
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,080
 10 of them give a bad report,

150
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,880
 say, "Aiya, too big a people, right, too strong.

151
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,020
 "We cannot enter the land.

152
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,840
 "We're too weak, they're too big."

153
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,020
 Okay, it's not going to happen.

154
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,700
 We're not able to defeat them.

155
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,200
 But two of the spies, Joshua and Caleb,

156
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,760
 God says had a different perspective.

157
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,000
 They had a different spirit.

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,600
 They had faith, and they knew that if God was the one

159
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,920
 who had told them to take the land,

160
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,800
 yes, the enemy might be strong,

161
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,020
 yes, it might look like it's impossible,

162
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,760
 but if God had said it would happen,

163
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,140
 then nothing would be able to stop them.

164
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,880
 And so as a result, God said the other spies

165
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
 and that generation of people who did not believe

166
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,160
 would not be allowed to enter into the promised land

167
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,640
 because they didn't obey God, because of the lack of faith.

168
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,240
 And only Joshua and Caleb would, in the end,

169
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,840
 end up entering into the promised land.

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,160
 And so what happens is they end up roaming around

171
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,760
 in the desert until this unbelieving generation had died off.

172
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,520
 But now, as I said, the moment is here.

173
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,160
 Joshua is ready.

174
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,920
 You can sense his anticipation, it's palpable.

175
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,800
 The promised land awaits, and God reassures him

176
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,820
 with these famous words, Joshua 1:9.

177
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,040
 You probably have a coffee mug with this on it, right?

178
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,760
 Have I commanded you, be strong and courageous.

179
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,480
 Do not be afraid, do not be discouraged,

180
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,480
 for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.

181
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,520
 So Joshua starts making preparations.

182
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,800
 There's a battle ahead, right?

183
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
 Because even though this land has been promised to them,

184
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,880
 like I said, they are cities and strongholds,

185
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,740
 there's people already living there

186
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,200
 that need to be defeated.

187
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,640
 And the first city he needs to take over

188
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,080
 is the city of Jericho.

189
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,380
 Now Jericho was a big, strong, fortified city,

190
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,960
 a city that did not worship God,

191
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,040
 they worshiped the pagan gods who religious practices

192
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,000
 involved the evils of things like child sacrifice,

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,880
 right, things like that.

194
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,320
 They definitely did not follow the God of gods,

195
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,720
 the king of kings.

196
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,060
 A big, strong city though, thick walls.

197
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,480
 From the outside it looked strong and shakable.

198
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,080
 It looked like an impossible challenge.

199
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,840
 And so Joshua, being the good military leader that he is,

200
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,600
 he had some tactics, he had some plans in mind.

201
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,040
 And he sent spies to check out what the situation is there.

202
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,320
 But when the spies come back this time,

203
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,020
 the report is a bit different.

204
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,460
 So during the spy mission, the spies are helped

205
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,120
 by a woman called Rahab.

206
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,160
 Rahab is a Canaanite prostitute

207
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,560
 that lives within the walls of Jericho.

208
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,120
 And through Rahab, they realize that the whole city

209
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,900
 is in fact terrified of the Israelites.

210
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,960
 They're terrified because they have heard

211
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,600
 the stories of the Israelites, right,

212
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,640
 how God defeated the Egyptians,

213
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,060
 how God parted the Red Seas,

214
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,900
 how God helped them with the different nations.

215
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,160
 And so Rahab begins to realize who this God is.

216
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,240
 Rahab recognizes, these are words,

217
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,400
 that the Lord your God is God in heaven

218
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,240
 and above and on the earth below.

219
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,000
 And so Rahab promises, I will help you, spies.

220
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,800
 I will help you, I'll keep you hidden, I'll keep you safe,

221
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,480
 if in return, when the time comes for Jericho

222
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,060
 to be destroyed, me and my household,

223
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,580
 those in my house, we're gonna be spared.

224
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,640
 And the spies oblige, they say, yes, if you help us,

225
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,300
 you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours,

226
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,260
 you know, good guanxi, you know, good Chinese practice,

227
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,080
 you know, the spies oblige, and so they move on.

228
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,760
 Now, there is one more situation, though,

229
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,240
 that the Israelites need to face

230
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,120
 before finally entering into Jericho.

231
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,040
 The entire nation of Israel has to once again

232
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,200
 cross over a body of water.

233
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,520
 This time, it's the Jordan River.

234
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,960
 And God is faithful.

235
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,840
 Just as God parted the Red Sea, God does the same thing.

236
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,960
 The waters of the Jordan River are parted,

237
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,840
 and the Bible tells us the Israelites

238
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,400
 are able to pass through on dry ground.

239
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,520
 The entire nation, the millions of people

240
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,000
 are able to pass through on dry ground.

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,460
 And so the Israelites celebrate, God is faithful,

242
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,480
 God is good, they build an altar in the middle of the river

243
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,760
 to remind them of this moment.

244
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,960
 It only serves, though, to remind the surrounding nations

245
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,820
 around Israel at this time who God is.

246
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,480
 And it says, when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan

247
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,720
 and all the Canaanite kings along the coast

248
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
 heard how God had dried up the Jordan

249
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,980
 before the Israelites until they crossed over,

250
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,980
 their hearts melted in fear,

251
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,220
 and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.

252
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,120
 So the enemies are shaken,

253
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,180
 but the Israelites are celebrating.

254
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,080
 Now, why are we recalling all of this?

255
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,080
 It's always good, I think, for us to take a moment

256
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,720
 and remember God's faithfulness in the past,

257
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,360
 just as Emma encouraged us to do just now.

258
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,920
 Because yes, the task at hand for Joshua

259
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,280
 was big and seemingly impossible.

260
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,840
 But look at what had God done for them in the past.

261
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,280
 Look how faithful God has been.

262
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,920
 Whenever the Israelites had something that needed,

263
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,760
 God was there for them.

264
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,280
 Whenever God gave them instruction

265
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,480
 and told them what to do and they listened,

266
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,660
 things go well for them.

267
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,520
 Even the impossible situations, God always comes through.

268
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,220
 It's only when they disobey and turn away from the laws,

269
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,960
 turn away from the covenant that they have made with God

270
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,640
 that things start going badly.

271
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,620
 It's a reminder for us today.

272
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,740
 As we live our lives, as you look ahead,

273
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,260
 are you facing challenges?

274
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,440
 Are you noticing some things that are coming up

275
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,060
 that are gonna be tough, that are gonna be hard?

276
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,820
 Take time.

277
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,580
 Think back to how God has guided you in the past.

278
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,880
 Remember that there was one point in your life,

279
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,460
 I'm sure we've all been there,

280
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,380
 a point where you thought this is the lowest of the low.

281
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,620
 There is no way I'm moving on from here,

282
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,220
 but by the grace of God, here you are sitting today.

283
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,500
 Let that be an encouragement to how he will continue

284
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,660
 to walk with you and be with you in the future.

285
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,860
 I think this is exactly what Joshua would have been thinking.

286
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,700
 Like I said, on the cusp of entering

287
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,740
 into the long-awaited promised land,

288
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,980
 like the boxer on the eve of the biggest fight of his life,

289
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,000
 recalling all the past battles and all the past pain,

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,620
 it's about to be worth it.

291
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,260
 From growing up as a slave boy in the land of Egypt,

292
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,380
 seeing God rescue them in the most miraculous of ways,

293
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,700
 fighting alongside Moses.

294
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,300
 Now, of course, he's going through the grief,

295
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,660
 burying one of his mentors and his best friends.

296
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,660
 40 years later, Joshua's moment arrives.

297
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,580
 The new Israel, the new leader,

298
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,160
 finally seeing the fruit of his faith.

299
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,740
 Remember what Promise was saying last week

300
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,760
 about the waiting?

301
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,340
 Sometimes that waiting might take 40 years.

302
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,880
 40 years Joshua waited.

303
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,220
 For those of us waiting on things that God has promised you,

304
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,320
 hopefully this is an encouragement too.

305
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,980
 Your time is coming yet.

306
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,420
 And God is not slow to fulfill his promises

307
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,260
 as we understand slowness, but God will always be faithful.

308
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,060
 And in this moment, just before entering into Jericho,

309
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,160
 the Bible tells us Joshua has an encounter with God.

310
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,660
 Now, when Joshua was near Jericho,

311
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,220
 he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him

312
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,500
 with a drawn sword in his hand.

313
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,620
 Now, this would have been quite an unusual sight indeed.

314
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,440
 Doesn't really tell us what Joshua was doing.

315
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,900
 Maybe he was taking like one more scouting, one more trip,

316
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,420
 I'm really ready for the next day.

317
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,960
 Remembering the situation, right?

318
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,860
 He is about to go into war.

319
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,300
 He's just outside of enemy territory.

320
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,900
 And Joshua himself, a military man, a warrior,

321
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,440
 so seeing a man with a drawn sword

322
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,260
 would have put him on high alert.

323
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,220
 A drawn sword was a sign that this person

324
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,540
 was ready to fight.

325
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,740
 It's, you know, I'm about to engage in battle,

326
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,300
 why else would you draw your sword?

327
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,020
 But I don't think this was ever supposed

328
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,380
 to be an act of aggression.

329
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,440
 I think this was God's unique way

330
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,580
 of trying to capture Joshua's attention.

331
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,380
 You see, God did the same thing to his leader,

332
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,920
 to his mentor Moses a few years ago.

333
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,780
 The whole thing is the echo of what Moses experienced

334
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,540
 in his wilderness.

335
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,960
 When God first called Moses,

336
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,540
 he too was walking around in the wilderness

337
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,140
 looking after the sheep.

338
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,740
 He sees a strange sight, right?

339
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,220
 A bush that's on fire but doesn't burn up.

340
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,820
 So in his context, this is strange, right?

341
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,260
 I've been in the wilderness all this time,

342
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,540
 you know, a bush that doesn't burn up that's on fire,

343
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,060
 I'm gonna go and check it out.

344
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,660
 God uses something he knew would capture Moses' attention

345
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,020
 to draw him close and Moses responds.

346
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,500
 And in the same way now,

347
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,980
 God is trying to capture Joshua's attention.

348
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,220
 And he too does it in a way that he knows

349
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,460
 Joshua will notice.

350
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,200
 A man with a drawn sword would have captured

351
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,620
 the attention of a military man.

352
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,860
 And so Joshua responds.

353
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,260
 Our question for today, church.

354
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,860
 I wonder how God might be trying to grab your intention

355
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,160
 and initiate an encounter with you.

356
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,660
 This is a reminder for us to be on the lookout

357
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,020
 for these moments.

358
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,980
 Okay, they're probably not gonna happen all the time

359
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,500
 but God knows you and he knows the things

360
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,940
 are gonna grab your attention.

361
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,180
 The question is, will we have the eyes

362
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,340
 to recognize these moments and when we recognize them,

363
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,100
 will we then have the heart to respond?

364
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,820
 And we see that Joshua is ready.

365
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,740
 He sees a man and he responds by engaging with the man

366
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,980
 and asking him a question.

367
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,420
 Are you for us or for our enemies?

368
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,660
 It's beautiful, I love how direct Joshua is in this moment.

369
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,060
 His heart reflects the heart of a warrior and a leader.

370
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,860
 He doesn't back down.

371
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,420
 He stays true to his calling as God gave him, right?

372
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,260
 To be strong and courageous.

373
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,860
 Because as the leader of Israel now,

374
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,780
 there is a certain sense of a responsibility on him.

375
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,060
 He needs to know what he's dealing with here

376
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,180
 because if this person is for them,

377
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,660
 then maybe he could invite them,

378
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,060
 invite him to join them and help in his fight.

379
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,220
 But if he's part of the enemy,

380
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,460
 this is gonna be a problem, right?

381
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,180
 You have your sword, okay, I'm gonna draw my sword,

382
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,820
 let's throw down right now, okay?

383
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,420
 So he's thinking these things, right?

384
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,340
 He is relishing his role as the leader.

385
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,660
 He's ready.

386
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,060
 But what he's not ready for, I think,

387
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,900
 what he didn't think was gonna happen

388
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,220
 was the answer that this man gives.

389
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,100
 And the answer the man gives makes Joshua realize this,

390
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,140
 actually, this isn't just a normal person I'm talking to,

391
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,540
 but he's having an encounter with someone

392
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
 who is truly divine.

393
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,140
 The response is this, "Neither or no," he replies,

394
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,580
 "but as a commander of the army of the Lord,

395
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,180
 "I have now come."

396
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,020
 Then Joshua fell face down to the ground in reverence

397
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,140
 and asked him, "What message does my Lord

398
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,340
 "have for his servant?"

399
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,060
 Now, if you look through commentaries,

400
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,980
 that's a lot of questioning as to the identity

401
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,660
 of this person, who he really is.

402
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,940
 There's a common understanding,

403
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,100
 where this is an example of the theological term for this,

404
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,620
 is a theophany, right?

405
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,660
 Meaning this was an example of God himself

406
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,800
 manifesting in human form.

407
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,240
 Maybe a bit like what Jacob experienced last week,

408
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,760
 or Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace,

409
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,260
 there's a fourth person with them, that kind of a thing.

410
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,560
 Some people say that this was maybe a high-ranking angel

411
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,920
 in the Lord's army, right?

412
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,860
 We know that God has legions and legions of angels

413
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,760
 ready to fight on his behalf at any moment.

414
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,360
 Some people think it was an angel representing God,

415
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,720
 so sort of like a heavenly spokesperson.

416
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,760
 No matter who it is, there is no doubt

417
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,000
 that this is not a human being.

418
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,080
 But this was God's way of encountering Joshua.

419
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,080
 And so his first response is to fall in worship, right?

420
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,620
 Probably the only appropriate thing he could have done.

421
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,400
 Now, as I was reading this, it made me wonder,

422
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,380
 how would I respond, or how would we respond,

423
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,020
 if we suddenly found ourselves face-to-face with God?

424
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,400
 I mean, on a comical sort of level,

425
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,040
 I wonder if we could even handle it, right?

426
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,240
 I've seen people lose their minds

427
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,840
 when they encounter celebrities.

428
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,740
 I remember when I was about probably eight or nine years old,

429
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,960
 I was swimming at the YMCA,

430
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,640
 and Andy Lau suddenly appeared, right?

431
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,840
 Wow, yeah, there was already, yeah.

432
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,280
 Back then, okay, this was the early '90s,

433
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,420
 dating myself a little bit,

434
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,560
 but Andy Lau was probably like the most popular pop star,

435
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,220
 movie star in Hong Kong at that moment, okay?

436
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,160
 It's such a vivid memory.

437
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,280
 I remember what he was wearing.

438
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,240
 He was wearing, he wasn't wearing normal swimming shorts.

439
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,920
 He was wearing a bathing suit for men,

440
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,560
 so he had the straps that went down,

441
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,080
 like a mankini, I guess is what you call it, okay?

442
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,160
 It was black and white stripes, okay?

443
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,640
 Now, girls were going absolutely crazy.

444
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,200
 Wow, that's, you know, like, literally,

445
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,680
 flocking towards him, trying to push him into the pool, okay?

446
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,400
 Literally, the girls were going crazy for Andy Lau,

447
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,360
 and I thought to myself, I've got to get myself

448
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,720
 one of those swimming costumes, okay?

449
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,220
 Maybe that's what's working for him, I don't know.

450
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,200
 But we react when famous people come into,

451
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,380
 if Taylor Swift walked into this room right now, right,

452
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,920
 we would go nuts, right?

453
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,880
 This place would be bonkers,

454
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,280
 we'd all over YouTube, all over the news, right?

455
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,580
 She would start singing, we would sing along, okay?

456
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,220
 It would be crazy.

457
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,280
 And sometimes, I think, we think that's what

458
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
 encountering God's gonna be like.

459
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,160
 Oh, yes, it's gonna be amazing.

460
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,020
 It's gonna be so exciting, so cool.

461
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,800
 It's gonna be so great.

462
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,240
 But I think we might have to take a step back

463
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,260
 and think again, if that's what's in our minds.

464
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,520
 Because here's the thing.

465
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,640
 We say we want to have these encounters with God,

466
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,620
 but are we really ready for them?

467
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,900
 We say we want to see God's glory,

468
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,880
 but do we really know what seeing God's glory really means?

469
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,600
 Because when we look back through Scripture,

470
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,240
 a lot of times when people have these encounters with God,

471
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,800
 two things happen.

472
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,640
 First, there's the initial reaction.

473
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,860
 Right, often this includes things like fear and trembling.

474
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,360
 Like Joshua falling face down is a common reaction.

475
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,640
 Being unable to move is a common reaction.

476
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,680
 Realizing that we are sinful in the presence of holiness

477
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,220
 and a sense of impending doom upon our lives,

478
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,720
 that's a common reaction.

479
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,160
 But the second thing, this is usually followed,

480
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,160
 an encounter with God is also almost always followed

481
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,520
 by a command.

482
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,440
 Something we are to do.

483
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,900
 Something we need to follow.

484
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,660
 Something that's gonna require our obedience to Him.

485
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,320
 So let me ask this again.

486
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,320
 Do we really want to have an encounter with God?

487
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,560
 Because having a true encounter with God

488
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,920
 will most likely demand something from you

489
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,120
 and end up changing your life.

490
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,440
 Now sometimes I think we want to encounter with God

491
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,040
 because then we can finally have Him where we want Him.

492
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,280
 We can tell Him what we want and He'll give it to us, right?

493
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,240
 We want God to come into our space.

494
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,160
 We think we want to encounter God

495
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,000
 because that's the way to get God on our side.

496
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,620
 But when we look at God's response to Joshua,

497
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,480
 it's a reminder for us, this is a truth

498
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,840
 that maybe we don't talk about very often.

499
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,040
 Let me remind you, Joshua asked the questions,

500
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,200
 are you for us or for our enemies?

501
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,120
 God's answer is no, neither.

502
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,040
 I beg your pardon.

503
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,880
 These are the Israelites, these are God's people, right?

504
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,800
 Hasn't God been leading them precisely

505
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,760
 to this time and place?

506
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,600
 And yet before the biggest battle they're ever gonna face,

507
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,700
 God is saying, I'm not actually on your side.

508
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,480
 What happens with the promise that He would be with them

509
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,200
 wherever they go?

510
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,980
 You sometimes, as human beings,

511
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,960
 we want to give God our agenda.

512
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,160
 This is something we've become very good at, right?

513
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,620
 We want to drag God into our preferences and our ideas,

514
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,680
 claim that God is on our side

515
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,000
 because we want to make God fit into our plans,

516
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,140
 to what we think it's right.

517
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,940
 But really, church, it needs to be the other way around.

518
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,360
 God is reminding us He doesn't take sides.

519
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,080
 God stands alone.

520
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,440
 He is holy, He is set apart.

521
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,840
 And God's purposes are not subject to human agenda.

522
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,760
 God is not a God that can be manipulated

523
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,540
 into acting on our behalf and for our benefit.

524
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,640
 Now, this stands in stark contrast

525
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,000
 to what the worshipers of the pagan gods believed.

526
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,960
 Right, they were of the belief

527
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,120
 that there's certain rituals if you do this,

528
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,460
 if you give certain offerings,

529
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,240
 you can manipulate the gods into answering your prayers,

530
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,240
 into doing whatever you ask them to do, whatever it is.

531
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,320
 And actually, we still, this play out in Hong Kong today,

532
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,840
 in our modern-day context,

533
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,120
 some of this thinking still prevails.

534
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,000
 We're just at the tail end of the Hungry Ghost Festival,

535
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,360
 right, Yulanti, at the tail end of the Hungry Ghost Festival.

536
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,040
 And what's all that about?

537
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,820
 Right, burning offerings and incense and food

538
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,520
 and all these effigies of different things, right,

539
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,180
 appeasing these hungry ghosts and spirits

540
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,740
 so that we can manipulate them

541
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,600
 into actually not coming near us or staying away from us

542
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,520
 or blessing us in some way.

543
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,040
 Not so with our God.

544
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,460
 God will not be manipulated.

545
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,060
 Our God is the one true God.

546
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,120
 He is not one that can have his mind changed

547
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,220
 with gifts and offerings, no.

548
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,860
 We do not try and make God align with us.

549
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,880
 We are called to be fully committed to him.

550
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,220
 [audience member speaks faintly]

551
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,520
 This is an important part for us to rest on

552
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,220
 because unless we understand this,

553
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,240
 we'll spend hours and hours in prayer,

554
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,560
 doing good deeds, giving tithes and offerings,

555
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,200
 not because we are actually worshiping

556
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,340
 and submitting to him.

557
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,180
 Rather, we're trying to twist God's arm,

558
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,020
 but that's not how it works.

559
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,300
 The most beautiful thing about Joshua's response

560
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,140
 is he immediately realizes that this isn't about him.

561
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,240
 He doesn't say, okay, now I have you, God.

562
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,440
 This is what I want you to do.

563
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,340
 These are the enemies.

564
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,040
 This is how I want you to fight the battle.

565
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,100
 Instead, he says, God, what message do you have for me?

566
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,740
 What do you want me to do?

567
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,460
 Joshua fell face down to the ground in reverence

568
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,140
 and asked him, what message does my Lord

569
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,180
 have for his servant?

570
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,100
 The commander of the Lord's army replied,

571
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,840
 take off your sandals for the place

572
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,600
 where you're standing is holy, and Joshua did so.

573
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,440
 The three things that Joshua does here

574
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,680
 that I think we should adapt for ourselves

575
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,140
 when we ask for and when we find ourselves

576
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,620
 having an encounter with God.

577
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,920
 Firstly, like I said just now, it's this.

578
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,760
 Worship, face down in reverence.

579
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,420
 Worship has to be the first response to God.

580
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,000
 When we realize we're in the presence

581
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,340
 of the holy, almighty God, the first thing we do

582
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,800
 is bow down in worship to him.

583
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,280
 Secondly, though, it's submission.

584
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,980
 What message does my Lord have for his servant?

585
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,460
 Joshua gives up his agenda so he can hear from God.

586
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,140
 I can almost guarantee you that if God said at that moment,

587
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,020
 Joshua, you are not ready, the nation is not ready,

588
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,560
 turn around, go back into the wilderness

589
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,040
 until I call you again, Joshua would have done it.

590
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,460
 Obedience, God calls him to take off your sandals

591
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,780
 and Joshua did so.

592
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,180
 He obeys because he knows he's in the presence

593
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,020
 of a holy God.

594
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,980
 Church, the question for today is this.

595
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,820
 Will this too be our response?

596
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,780
 Will we be a people who are willing to live

597
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,220
 in total worship, submission, and obedience

598
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,600
 to our holy God?

599
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,300
 Because if we really want to see God move in our lives,

600
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,300
 if we wanna see victory in the challenges

601
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,340
 that we're facing, if we wanna see God do the impossible

602
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,380
 to bring the walls down, then this is how we need to live.

603
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,060
 Now the problem is we might say yes at first.

604
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,100
 Even in that, okay, yes, it's exciting.

605
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,220
 But what if living, because living this way

606
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,580
 might not make sense to us, though.

607
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,020
 We have to be ready for that.

608
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,140
 What if living this way means that you are no longer

609
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,180
 in control of your lives?

610
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,200
 What if living this way means you're gonna look

611
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,060
 absolutely silly and ridiculous and stupid

612
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,560
 to the rest of the world?

613
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,580
 This is sort of what happens to Joshua

614
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,220
 in the next chapter, in chapter six.

615
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,260
 The battle for Jericho finally begins.

616
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,720
 Only the tactics that God gives to Moses

617
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,920
 sound completely ridiculous.

618
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,060
 Listen for yourself.

619
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,180
 This is how you bring the most fortified city

620
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,820
 in the area down right now, okay?

621
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,180
 This is what God says.

622
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,980
 March around the city once with all the armed men.

623
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,700
 Do this for six days.

624
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,100
 Have seven priests carry trumpets of ram's horns

625
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,180
 in front of the ark.

626
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,640
 On the seventh day, march around the city seven times

627
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,520
 with the priests blowing the trumpets.

628
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,240
 When you hear them, sound a long blast on the trumpets,

629
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,420
 have the whole army give out a loud shout,

630
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,660
 then the wall of the city will collapse

631
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,980
 and the army will go up, everyone straight in.

632
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,340
 What?

633
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,100
 Okay, I'm not military trained,

634
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,700
 but no matter how you see it, this makes no sense.

635
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,180
 Right, there is no military strategy,

636
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,220
 whatever, that God gives, but that's precisely the point.

637
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,100
 Jericho was already ready for the taking.

638
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,820
 Like we found out just now, everyone was already scared.

639
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,120
 The battle was already won by God.

640
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,420
 Everyone inside was already shook with fear.

641
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,700
 God is saying, I'm not interested, Joshua,

642
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,500
 in your leadership skills or your military knowledge

643
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,980
 and your power.

644
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,340
 My heart is to find out if you are indeed a people

645
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,500
 that represent my name.

646
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,620
 Are you a people that are really willing to follow

647
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,220
 and obedient to me no matter what I call you to do?

648
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,380
 And it's the same for us today.

649
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,940
 If we wanna be God's people,

650
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,060
 if we wanna represent his name well,

651
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,340
 if we wanna encounter him, if we want him to work

652
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,340
 in our lives, we must be willing, church, to be obedient.

653
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,180
 And being obedient is gonna mean that at times

654
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,460
 our actions are gonna be strange and unusual

655
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,300
 to those around us.

656
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,460
 It's not just this.

657
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,100
 The Bible is full of examples about people willing

658
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,260
 to do ridiculous things in the Lord's name

659
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,620
 because God told them so.

660
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,720
 Noah was told to build an ark when the earth

661
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,840
 had never even seen rain before.

662
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,780
 Abraham was told to get up and go

663
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,580
 without knowing where he was going.

664
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,420
 Daniel ate nothing but vegetables,

665
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,980
 but yet still became bigger and plumper and fatter

666
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,580
 than everyone else around him.

667
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,680
 All right, how's that for the Daniel diet?

668
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:55,000
 Ezekiel was told to lie on his side for 360 days.

669
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,960
 Hosea was told to marry a prostitute.

670
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,440
 Isaiah preached naked for three years.

671
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,340
 Attendance would go down to zero.

672
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:09,400
 John the Baptist lived in the desert and ate locusts.

673
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,080
 Zacchaeus gave people back four times

674
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,640
 the amount that he took.

675
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:19,240
 Jesus went to the cross and gave his life.

676
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,420
 None of what these people did makes sense

677
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,240
 from our perspective, yet they did so

678
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,220
 out of their obedience to God.

679
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,000
 You see, this was never about God preferring

680
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,280
 the Israelites over another group of people.

681
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,420
 This was always about God seeking those

682
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,720
 who were obedient to him.

683
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,940
 To prove this point, look what happens to Rahab.

684
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,340
 Rahab, who was part of the enemy,

685
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,660
 part of the Canaanites living in Jericho,

686
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,300
 Rahab would have been destroyed with the rest of Jericho,

687
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,220
 but God keeps his promise to Rahab

688
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,800
 because she and her household were willing

689
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,460
 to be obedient to God.

690
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,260
 And what does Rahab go and do?

691
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,300
 She features in the lineage and the genealogy

692
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,740
 of Jesus himself.

693
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,260
 What about you?

694
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,860
 You see, as Christians, obedience is going

695
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,100
 to be a roadblock that we're gonna run into.

696
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,740
 Right, we have these goals in our lives,

697
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,180
 goals that we wanna reach, things we wanna see happen,

698
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,940
 walls that we wanna see brought down and removed,

699
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,860
 prayers that we wanna see answered,

700
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,620
 but yet when God gives us instructions

701
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,260
 on how to overcome them and how to reach our goals,

702
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,300
 sometimes I think we become like what I said

703
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,540
 I was in the beginning, right?

704
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,980
 We don't wanna follow his guidance,

705
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,260
 we don't wanna follow his instructions,

706
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,740
 like okay, okay, Lord, whatever,

707
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,820
 I'm just gonna do it my own way.

708
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,700
 We think we can do it better ourselves,

709
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,180
 so we strive and we try and we stumble and we fall,

710
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,980
 and then we have the audacity sometimes

711
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,540
 to go back and blame God and say,

712
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,140
 well, it didn't work out for me.

713
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,760
 The story of Joshua, though, reminds us.

714
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,060
 God's thoughts are not our thoughts.

715
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,540
 His ways are not our ways.

716
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,220
 And the wisdom of the world is foolishness in God's sight.

717
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,220
 What God is looking for are people

718
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,720
 who are willing to be obedient.

719
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,060
 Now, we have to think what that means in our context,

720
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,460
 in our culture, in our society for today.

721
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,060
 Now, I don't know, it could be a bunch of stuff,

722
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,420
 but for example, it might be choosing to reserve sex

723
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,480
 within the context of a marriage relationship.

724
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,280
 Maybe it means loving your enemies

725
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,060
 and praying for those who persecute you

726
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,320
 instead of attacking them and drawing these divides

727
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,380
 that we so have.

728
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,100
 Maybe it's being truthful

729
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,500
 in the way you conduct your business,

730
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,060
 when all the other businesses around you

731
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,580
 are known for leaving figures out

732
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,900
 and skimming off the top and all that kind of stuff.

733
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,260
 Maybe God is calling you to give faithfully,

734
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,480
 even if it's at a sacrifice to you.

735
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,740
 Things like this might make you look strange.

736
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,180
 Things like this are not easy to do,

737
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,580
 but it's obedience to God.

738
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,180
 And today, if you hear this message,

739
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,660
 how is God asking you to be obedient to him?

740
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,220
 The point of Joshua's encounter

741
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,260
 wasn't that God would give him victory over the enemies.

742
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,340
 Like I said, that was already a given.

743
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,980
 But what it gave him was a deeper heart,

744
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,580
 a deeper understanding, and a deeper desire

745
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,780
 to be obedient to God and see him working in his life.

746
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,220
 It helped Joshua to understand

747
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,340
 that God's work in our lives

748
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,580
 isn't about how big or good, how strong,

749
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,300
 and how great our plans are,

750
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,580
 but rather it's how devoted we are

751
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,940
 to doing whatever God has called us to do.

752
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,780
 And our prayer for us, church, this morning is the same,

753
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,580
 that as we encounter God, our hearts will be turned,

754
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,700
 our hearts will be changed,

755
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,940
 and that he would give us hearts

756
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,620
 that are more obedient to follow him,

757
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,000
 no matter where he leads us to go.

758
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,980
 So if you would, church, just close your eyes.

759
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,400
 Let's pray for a moment.

760
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,160
 [pages flipping]

761
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:26,320
 One thing that I know we haven't talked about yet,

762
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,200
 but as we pray about it,

763
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,960
 the word obedient triggers so many things

764
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,800
 in our hearts and minds, I feel like.

765
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,840
 'Cause often we feel like obedience to do with punishment.

766
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,080
 [soft music]

767
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,680
 And I can hear the words ringing in my head.

768
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,880
 [speaking in foreign language]

769
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,940
 You're not listening to me again.

770
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,600
 You didn't do what you're supposed to do.

771
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,840
 Now I'm gonna punish you.

772
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:56,160
 I want you to know that's not God's heart today.

773
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,000
 He's not using your lack of obedience

774
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,140
 as an opportunity to chastise you.

775
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,560
 [soft music]

776
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,500
 But it's a call back towards him.

777
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,340
 And yes, there might be some pain in that,

778
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,420
 leaving things that we're not supposed to behind

779
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,460
 that we've become so attached to will have pain.

780
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,000
 And there are consequences to disobedience, as we've said.

781
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,220
 But God's heart in calling you back close to him,

782
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,940
 calling you to be obedient to him,

783
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,600
 it's because he loves you.

784
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,800
 It's because this is what you were created for,

785
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,260
 to represent him,

786
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,220
 to do the good works that he has prepared for you to do,

787
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,320
 to praise and to worship him.

788
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,500
 That's where true life is found, no matter who we are.

789
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:56,540
 And so Jesus, I pray that above all things,

790
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,440
 we would look to you.

791
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,820
 [soft music]

792
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,580
 We thank you for your example,

793
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,940
 that you were willing to be obedient even to death,

794
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,320
 and death on a cross.

795
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,220
 And so Father, I pray that you would shape

796
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,020
 and mold our hearts in the same way.

797
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:22,700
 That as you call us,

798
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,500
 we would be willing to give up whatever it is that we have,

799
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,740
 whatever it is that we've been holding on to.

800
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,080
 So that we can have you.

801
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:37,360
 So Holy Spirit, I pray that you would guide us

802
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,440
 in this endeavor as well.

803
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,920
 It is a challenge.

804
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
 It is not something we're gonna be able to muster up

805
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,120
 our own will and power to do,

806
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,280
 but only when accompanied by the power of the Holy Spirit,

807
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,120
 can we walk in line with how God has called us to live.

808
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,240
 May this, Lord, be what we're known for.

809
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,860
 A people, a church, the body of Christ,

810
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,380
 in total submission and obedience

811
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,020
 to what you have called us to do.

812
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:10,860
 We pray in Jesus' loving, powerful, saving name.

813
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,780
 Amen.

814
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,200

815
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,780
