1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 that as we open your scriptures, we would see you.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 And we thank you for this.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,320
 In Jesus' name, everyone says, amen.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,520
 Hey, can we thank our worship team as always?

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,400
 (congregation applauding)

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,960
 Have a seat, have a seat.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,800
 Welcome to the Vine, if you're relatively new here.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
 We're so glad you're with us.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,960
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors.

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,960
 And I honestly, I cannot tell you how excited I am

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,200
 for what's about to happen.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,520
 We're about to do something very different here

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,720
 at the Vine.

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,440
 In a moment, we're gonna take a moment

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,840
 to invite every single one of you

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,040
 to be personally prayed for this evening.

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,320
 In fact, I'm gonna share a message in a moment,

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,040
 but really my message is just a warm up

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,520
 to the real message, which will be the Holy Spirit

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,560
 speaking to each one of you privately and personally.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,640
 But I do wanna share something

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,680
 'cause I wanna set up why we're doing this,

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,560
 why we're creating space for this tonight.

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,600
 If you've been coming to the Vine for a while,

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,360
 you'll know that this year is a year

26
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,960
 where we're calling us to action.

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,880
 Where we're calling the church, us,

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,440
 to really living our faith more publicly in 2025

29
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,360
 than we've ever done so before.

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,000
 Because we really sense the need that there is

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,120
 in our city for a revival that we were just singing about.

32
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,960
 And if we can understand this,

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,400
 as much as we long for revival in these 90 minutes

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,320
 on a Sunday, the true revival we should be longing for

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,200
 is that the lost would come to Jesus.

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,840
 And when we get a heart for the passion

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,800
 of sharing the gospel in creative, in new,

38
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,480
 and loving, and gracious, but courageous and bold ways,

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,720
 whether with our colleagues or our families

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,920
 or with the people that we have in our sphere of influence,

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,800
 I think then we begin to see a movement of God.

42
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,480
 And so this desire we have here at the Vine this year

43
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,320
 is to be a church on the move, a church in action,

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,600
 a church living its faith far more publicly

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,680
 than ever before.

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,440
 And as I was praying for us at the beginning of this year,

47
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,640
 I sensed God just say three very specific words.

48
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,960
 He says, "Andrew, the Vine, the people of your church,

49
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,840
 "of this church, are primed for purpose."

50
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,920
 I love that idea.

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,680
 I'd never thought of it this way.

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,160
 These are words that I felt like the Spirit

53
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,360
 has dropped into my heart.

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,360
 He said, "The people are primed for purpose."

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,960
 And so I wanna just say over you here this evening,

56
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,880
 you are primed for purpose.

57
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,840
 That in this room, there are people

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,360
 from different backgrounds and cultures.

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,680
 There are people who are doing different things,

60
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,440
 working in the marketplace, teachers, lawyers, bankers.

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,480
 We got stay-at-home parents, we got domestic workers,

62
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,720
 refugees and asylum seekers in our midst.

63
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,120
 We have people that make a lot of money

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
 and people that don't make any money at all.

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,160
 We have people that are incredibly gifted,

66
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,200
 people that have a call and a passion.

67
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,200
 Every single one of you, if Jesus is your Lord and Savior,

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,320
 He has primed you for the purposes

69
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,600
 of His kingdom in Hong Kong.

70
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,280
 Oh, I'm gonna say this again.

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,680
 If you call Jesus your Lord and Savior,

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,320
 you have been primed for the purposes

73
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,040
 of His kingdom in Hong Kong.

74
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,560
 So you are primed for purpose.

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,520
 But I wanna just say that what I think

76
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,240
 the Holy Spirit wants to do tonight

77
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,560
 is to release you into that purpose,

78
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,440
 to release you through the empowerment of the Holy Spirit

79
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,560
 into the purpose that He has for you.

80
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,840
 And as I was praying about this,

81
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,720
 I felt led to a famous passage of scripture

82
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,920
 in the Old Testament.

83
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,720
 It's one that we've actually spoken on a few times before

84
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,800
 in our years in the past, Ezekiel 37,

85
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,560
 which is the famous chapter of the Valley of Dry Bones

86
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,720
 and Ezekiel's vision of this Valley of Dry Bones.

87
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,480
 And I know it's a familiar passage,

88
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,720
 but I wanna jump into it briefly here tonight

89
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
 because I think we see some principles there

90
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
 that will then facilitate the prayer time

91
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,080
 that we wanna focus on here this evening.

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,240
 When Ezekiel's prophesying,

93
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,520
 it's really important that you understand

94
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,160
 he's prophesying in the exile period.

95
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,120
 He's known as one of the exilic prophets.

96
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
 The exile period, it was about 650 or so years before Christ

97
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,720
 and it was the time where the Babylonians

98
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,200
 had come into Jerusalem because God was judging His people

99
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,400
 because of their idolatry and idol worship,

100
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,960
 He allowed Babylon to come in.

101
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,640
 They destroyed much of Jerusalem.

102
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,480
 They pulled down the temple and destroyed much of the temple

103
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,280
 and they took a remnant of Israel into exile.

104
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,280
 Now, this is one of the darkest times of Israel's history.

105
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,160
 It's one of the driest times that they have spiritually

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,120
 because whilst they're in exile,

107
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,160
 they're asking some pretty big questions

108
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,840
 of God and themselves.

109
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
 They're like, why is this happened?

110
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,640
 We thought God was on our side.

111
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,280
 Why are we now in this place where it feels like God

112
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,520
 is so distant from us?

113
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,080
 It feels like things are so dry

114
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,600
 and it feels really hard for us.

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,920
 And then they began to realize that actually the reason

116
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,240
 they're in exile is because of their sin,

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
 because of their idolatry and their brokenness.

118
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,600
 And so then they're beginning to be discouraged

119
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,320
 'cause they're like, well, is God ever gonna forgive us?

120
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,480
 Is God ever gonna change the situation

121
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,080
 or are we now just kind of condemned people?

122
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,120
 And so God raises up prophets like Ezekiel

123
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,760
 to speak into that dry moment of Israel's history.

124
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,960
 And Ezekiel speaks both the judgment side

125
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,720
 and he helps Israel to wrestle with the reality

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,120
 that their sin has brought them into this place.

127
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,640
 But then in chapter 36, 37 and onwards,

128
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,520
 he shifts the narrative.

129
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,680
 And he begins to speak hope again.

130
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,800
 He begins to speak a change is going to happen.

131
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,280
 That the spirit of God is gonna pour out and change hearts.

132
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,760
 That the old and stone kind of concrete style hearts

133
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,240
 are gonna become hearts of flesh again.

134
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,480
 And that he's gonna bring a revival by his spirit.

135
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,360
 And Ezekiel begins to prophesy for this messianic hope

136
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,600
 that is going to come a new savior

137
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,800
 where God will act in the world again

138
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,520
 like he has never acted before.

139
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,800
 And so, although this is a dry time,

140
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
 change is going to happen.

141
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,920
 Are you with me?

142
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,280
 And I wanna pick up the story right here

143
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,240
 where he sees this incredible vision,

144
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,000
 because this is the turning point

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,440
 for a people who were primed for purpose,

146
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,480
 but we're currently lost.

147
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,840
 He says this, Ezekiel 37 verse one.

148
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,920
 "The hand of the Lord was upon me

149
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,680
 and he brought me out by the spirit of the Lord

150
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,840
 and set me in the middle of a valley.

151
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,200
 It was full of bones.

152
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,680
 He led me back and forth among them

153
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,760
 and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley,

154
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,040
 bones that were very dry.

155
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,280
 And then he asked me this,

156
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,600
 'Son of man, can these bones live?'"

157
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,800
 Son of man, can these bones live?

158
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,480
 What might seem like a pretty straightforward question

159
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,120
 for us that we would think probably has some sort

160
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,120
 of straightforward answer was anything but for Ezekiel.

161
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,600
 Because Ezekiel understood the bigger context

162
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,920
 behind the vision that he was seeing.

163
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,360
 It's really important you understand this.

164
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,600
 This is not the first time that God has spoken to a prophet

165
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
 about a valley of dry bones.

166
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,280
 In fact, God has previously spoken to Jeremiah

167
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,880
 about the very same thing.

168
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,600
 Interestingly, Ezekiel remember is prophesying

169
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,320
 during the exile period, Jeremiah prophesied pre-exile.

170
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,600
 So before Babylon had come in and destroyed Jerusalem

171
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,000
 and pulled down the temple,

172
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,080
 Jeremiah is raised up by God to prophesy

173
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,960
 about the way in which Israel was in idol worship.

174
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,720
 And Jeremiah has some pretty tough things to say to Israel

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,320
 because they're at a point where Jeremiah is like,

176
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,240
 "If you don't repent, if you don't change,

177
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,760
 then something is going to happen."

178
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,080
 Of course, that's the exile.

179
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,000
 So in Jeremiah, I want you to,

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,240
 I'm just gonna jump back to chapter eight of Jeremiah

181
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,040
 and I wanna read you some words that God brings

182
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,680
 through Jeremiah to bring this idea

183
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,040
 of the idol worship to Israel.

184
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,520
 Chapter eight, verse one of Jeremiah.

185
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,400
 "At that time, declares the Lord,

186
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,480
 the bones of the king," notice this,

187
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,400
 "the bones of the kings and the officials of Judah,

188
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,440
 the bones of the priests and the prophets,

189
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,560
 the bones of the people of Jerusalem

190
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,040
 will be removed from their graves.

191
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,240
 They will be exposed to the sun and the moon

192
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,960
 and all the stars of heaven,

193
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,880
 which they have loved and consulted and worshiped."

194
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,120
 There's the idol worship.

195
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,280
 "But we will be like refuge."

196
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,520
 So they will not be gathered up or buried,

197
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,720
 but they will be like refuge lying on the ground.

198
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,120
 I wonder if you can hear what's happening here.

199
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,600
 God through Jeremiah is bringing this judgment

200
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,200
 upon God's people and he's saying,

201
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,480
 "Look, there's a valley that's gonna happen

202
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,920
 and there's all these bones

203
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,760
 that are gonna be brought out of the graves

204
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,720
 and they're gonna be scattered in this valley

205
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,600
 and the sun and the moon are gonna beat down on them

206
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,040
 and they're gonna dry up

207
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,440
 and it's gonna be like refuge on the ground."

208
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,720
 This was God's judgment against Israel.

209
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,040
 So a number of years later, here's Ezekiel

210
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,560
 and he suddenly gets a vision

211
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,640
 and it's a vision of dry bones

212
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,200
 and immediately he connects it

213
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
 to what happened for Jeremiah.

214
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,600
 Immediately he goes back and he makes that connection.

215
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
 So when God says, "Son of man, can these bones live?"

216
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,800
 Notice this, Ezekiel is now in a tough spot.

217
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
 Can you understand the context here?

218
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,040
 Imagine if you put yourself in Ezekiel's sandals.

219
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,920
 It's almost like this is a lose-lose question.

220
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,000
 'Cause if he says, "Yes, they can live."

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,760
 God's like, "But I brought judgment on these people."

222
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,400
 If he says, "No, they can't."

223
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,680
 God could say, "Well, don't you think I can?"

224
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,040
 And so Ezekiel is sort of in this tough spot.

225
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,320
 Now notice God says to him,

226
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,840
 "Son of man, can these bones live?"

227
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,320
 God is emphasizing the humanity of Ezekiel

228
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,640
 and he's basically asking Ezekiel as a human being,

229
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,320
 "Do you think as a human being

230
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,760
 that these things can come to life?

231
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,800
 The things that I have judged as dead?"

232
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,240
 Notice how smart Ezekiel is.

233
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,520
 Notice how he responds, I love this.

234
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,200
 He says, "Oh, sovereign Lord, you alone know."

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,760
 Oh, that was clever.

236
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,000
 Wasn't that good?

237
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 You alone know.

238
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,400
 But I want you to see actually what's happening here.

239
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,920
 Notice first of all, what Ezekiel says.

240
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
 He says, "Oh, sovereign Lord."

241
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,800
 God has just said to him, "Oh, son of man."

242
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,160
 By emphasizing his humanity,

243
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,720
 he responds with, "Oh, sovereign Lord."

244
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,560
 Emphasizing, you could argue overemphasizing God's divinity.

245
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,000
 Notice the word sovereign here

246
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,320
 'cause this is really important.

247
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,760
 Ezekiel is saying, "Look, you are sovereign.

248
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
 You are the ultimate power."

249
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,000
 Ezekiel is walking in the opposite spirit

250
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,280
 to what Israel had done before when Jeremiah judged them.

251
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,720
 'Cause in those days, they were looking up to the skies

252
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
 and worshiping the stars

253
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,680
 and worshiping anything other than the true Yahweh.

254
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,720
 Here's Ezekiel in exile, and he's saying,

255
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,880
 "You're sovereign.

256
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,960
 You're the greatest.

257
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
 There is no other name better than your name.

258
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,160
 You know everything.

259
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,680
 You hold everything together."

260
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,760
 It's him walking in the opposite spirit.

261
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
 Do you see that?

262
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
 This is not a desperation.

263
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,240
 This is a statement of faith.

264
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,680
 He's saying, "Oh, sovereign Lord,

265
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,760
 because you are the ultimate power,

266
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,560
 you hold everything in your hands."

267
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,480
 He then says, "You alone know."

268
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,320
 He's not saying, notice this.

269
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,440
 He's not saying, "I have no idea."

270
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,240
 He's not saying, "I'm completely confused.

271
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,120
 I don't know what's going on.

272
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,400
 I have no idea."

273
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,880
 He's simply saying this, "You are sovereign.

274
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,800
 I am not.

275
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,040
 You are God.

276
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,960
 I am not."

277
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,600
 Because you're sovereign,

278
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,040
 if you wanted to bring something

279
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,440
 that you condemned to death to life again,

280
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,800
 that's your prerogative.

281
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,160
 That is in your hands.

282
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,080
 You alone know.

283
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,400
 This is an expression of Ezekiel saying,

284
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,120
 "I trust you, and I expect that whatever it is

285
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,000
 that you wanna happen will take place."

286
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,520
 It's a beautiful expression of faith.

287
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
 Some of you in this room,

288
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,160
 you're wondering at the start of this year,

289
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,600
 will this marriage live?

290
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,560
 Some of you perhaps are wrestling,

291
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,280
 will my job survive?

292
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,960
 Or will I get laid off in the economy

293
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,000
 that we're facing at the moment?

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,040
 Some of you might be like,

295
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,360
 "I don't know if my body is gonna get healed

296
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,200
 of this disease."

297
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,480
 We know that there's a number of people in our community

298
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,440
 who are dealing with very difficult

299
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,440
 terminal illnesses right now.

300
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,000
 And perhaps you're wondering,

301
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,360
 will I actually live?

302
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,760
 And these are the big questions of life.

303
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,480
 But I wonder whether we could take a little page

304
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
 from Ezekiel's book here,

305
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
 who basically says, "Oh, sovereign Lord,

306
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
 you alone know."

307
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,880
 In other words, I believe that you can do all things.

308
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,640
 I believe that everything is in your hands.

309
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,680
 I believe that you could move

310
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,280
 and do something that I could never do.

311
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,600
 You're a miracle-making God.

312
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,360
 You alone know if that's something

313
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,280
 you're gonna do or not.

314
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,160
 But I'm gonna submit myself,

315
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
 not to the worship of stars,

316
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,400
 not to the worship of some moons.

317
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,280
 I'm gonna give myself only over

318
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,520
 to the sovereignty and the power of God

319
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,720
 and say, "If it's in your hands to do it,

320
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,440
 it will happen."

321
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,600
 Are you with me?

322
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,040
 You alone know, he says.

323
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,560
 You alone know.

324
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,520
 Notice how God responds to this,

325
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,360
 picking it up from verse four.

326
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,320
 So then God said to me,

327
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,280
 "Prophesy to these bones and say to them,

328
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,680
 'Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.

329
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,160
 This is what the sovereign Lord says to these bones.

330
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,400
 I will make breath enter you,

331
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,880
 and you will come to life.

332
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,640
 I will attach tendons to you

333
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,280
 and make flesh come upon you

334
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,600
 and cover you with skin.

335
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,240
 I will put my breath in you

336
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,520
 and you will come to life.

337
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,320
 Then you will know that I am the Lord.'

338
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,400
 So I prophesied as I was commanded.

339
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,680
 And as I was prophesying,

340
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,880
 there was a noise and a rattling sound.

341
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,680
 And the bones came together, bone to bone.

342
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,880
 I looked and tendons and flesh

343
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,960
 appeared on them and skin covered them,

344
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,440
 but there was no breath in them."

345
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,880
 I love what happens here.

346
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,360
 Follow the story.

347
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,280
 God has said, "Son of man, can these bones live?"

348
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,920
 Asking if Ezekiel was gonna walk

349
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,280
 in a different way to his ancestors.

350
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,360
 Ezekiel responds, "Sovereign Lord, only you know.

351
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,840
 You alone know."

352
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,120
 Now, what God could have done at this moment

353
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,960
 is said, "Great answer, Ezekiel.

354
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,040
 Okay, I want you to stand back, Ezekiel,

355
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,360
 'cause watch what only I can do."

356
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,760
 And God could have jumped into the scene

357
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,960
 and sort of gathered up all those bones

358
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,240
 and had Ezekiel stand there eating popcorn

359
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,200
 whilst he does the most amazing thing ever

360
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,920
 and brings his army together and releases them.

361
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,000
 And basically says, "Israel is gonna go forward

362
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 and do all these great things."

363
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,960
 And basically Ezekiel could have been a bystander

364
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,280
 to the amazing miracle,

365
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,680
 but that's not the way God works.

366
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,760
 You need to see this 'cause this is so important.

367
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,600
 God could have done it that way,

368
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,920
 but he doesn't do it that way.

369
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
 He instead says to Ezekiel,

370
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,600
 "I want you to partner with me in this process."

371
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,120
 He says, "I want you to prophesy to the bones.

372
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,240
 I want you to prophesy to the flesh.

373
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,840
 I want you to prophesy that this is going to happen."

374
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,800
 In other words, God's like, "The miracle is still mine.

375
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,680
 It's not yours, Ezekiel.

376
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,000
 I'm the one who's actually gonna make the change.

377
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,040
 I'm the one who's gonna bring the bones together,

378
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,120
 but I want you to partner with me in that process.

379
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,040
 I want you to be a mouthpiece, a conduit.

380
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,000
 I want you to be involved in this process.

381
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,840
 It's not your miracle, Ezekiel.

382
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,760
 You are right, only I know, but guess what?

383
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
 I wanna involve you.

384
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,560
 I want you to be a part of it.

385
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,880
 I want you to actually get to experience what it's like

386
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,920
 to see my glory come to the earth

387
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,240
 through the brokenness of you."

388
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,480
 Isn't that beautiful?

389
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,920
 See, we need to understand that this is the way God

390
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,720
 has always worked from this point forward,

391
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,040
 that he's always decided to use his broken vessels

392
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,280
 for his glory.

393
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,080
 Paul would later write of it this way.

394
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,360
 He would say, "It's like we're jars of clay,

395
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,800
 but there's this treasure that has been placed

396
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,280
 inside of jars of clay.

397
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,440
 In our brokenness, that treasure is released.

398
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,960
 There's something beautiful.

399
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,480
 It's his glory.

400
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,760
 It's his treasure, not ours.

401
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,920
 But there's something about the glory of God

402
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,600
 that is seen even more glorious when it comes out of us."

403
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,040
 When it comes through these broken vessels

404
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,640
 who for some reason God has decided

405
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,000
 he's going to partner with.

406
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,600
 See, God chooses to work through us,

407
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
 not because he thinks we're so great

408
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,560
 that we need to be involved,

409
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,680
 but because he is so gracious,

410
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,400
 he doesn't want us to be left out.

411
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,960
 Come on, church, follow this.

412
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,240
 'Cause he could have done it all on himself

413
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,160
 and Ezekiel would have stood back and gone,

414
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
 "Wow, that was amazing."

415
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,800
 Instead he said, "Prophesy, speak, take action, Ezekiel.

416
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,200
 I want you to be a part of this.

417
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,720
 In fact, I'm not gonna bring the bones together

418
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,880
 unless you open your mouth."

419
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,080
 What a challenge that must've been for Ezekiel.

420
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,120
 And he says, "So I start prophesying."

421
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,080
 I love the obedience of Ezekiel.

422
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,360
 He doesn't know what's gonna happen,

423
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,040
 but he starts prophesying how he's taught to be prophesied

424
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,480
 and he sees this thing happen and this stuff takes place

425
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,160
 and it blows him away.

426
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,360
 But then he goes, "But there's no breath in them."

427
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,320
 This is interesting.

428
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,120
 He's seen bones come together,

429
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,720
 flesh and muscle come on those bones,

430
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,960
 but he's basically like, "There's no breath here though."

431
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,840
 Now this is interesting 'cause in scripture,

432
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,280
 breath and life are always brought together.

433
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,480
 And in Ezekiel saying, "I didn't see breath on them."

434
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,800
 What he's basically saying is,

435
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,000
 "I don't see that these things can actually do

436
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,640
 the thing that you're calling them to do

437
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,800
 'cause there's just no life there yet."

438
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,960
 He's going back to Genesis chapter two

439
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,000
 into that beautiful moment

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
 where God creates the first human being.

441
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,400
 Remember that moment?

442
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,960
 God creates Adam out of the dust of the ground

443
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,800
 and he forms and shapes Adam.

444
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,760
 Now I want you to see this.

445
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,160
 He shapes Adam as a human being,

446
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,280
 but there's no breath in him to begin with.

447
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,560
 You need to understand that Adam was primed for purpose.

448
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,000
 Come on church.

449
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,800
 He was primed for purpose.

450
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,880
 He was about to be told that he was gonna basically go

451
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,480
 and look after the land and flourish it,

452
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,080
 that he was gonna meet with Eve

453
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 and that they would come together

454
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,880
 and begin to multiply in the world.

455
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,320
 He's about to be given all this incredible stuff.

456
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,720
 Adam is primed for purpose, but he's not yet alive.

457
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,280
 So the breath of God comes in Genesis two

458
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,760
 and brings Adam to life

459
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,320
 so that his purpose could be into action.

460
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,720
 You with me?

461
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,720
 So here's years later, Ezekiel seeing a valley of dry bones,

462
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,240
 seeing all these bones come together

463
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,920
 and creating lots of Adams in his vision.

464
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,480
 Lots of human beings have come together,

465
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,240
 but he says there's no breath in them.

466
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,200
 There's a vast army that is primed for purpose without life.

467
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:08,240
 And then God says this.

468
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,920
 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath,

469
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,600
 "prophesy son of man and say to it,

470
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
 "this is what the sovereign Lord says,

471
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,920
 "come from the four winds, oh breath

472
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,640
 "and breathe into these slain that they may live."

473
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,720
 So I prophesied as he commanded me and breath entered them.

474
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,720
 They came to life and stood on their feet, a vast army.

475
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,640
 See, they were primed for purpose, but without life.

476
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,360
 And as he prophesied the breath,

477
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,600
 the purpose that they had been primed for

478
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,920
 was able to come to life.

479
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,200
 They came to life to be able to live out

480
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,480
 and do the things that they were being called to do.

481
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,200
 This is a prophetic vision

482
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
 about what's about to happen to Israel

483
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,040
 as they come out of exile, go back into their land

484
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,360
 and begin to pray for a Messiah to come.

485
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,640
 And I want you to see the process

486
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,760
 that's taking place here in this passage.

487
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
 This is really important.

488
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,760
 So from dry and weary bones scattered across the valley floor

489
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,640
 to a group gathered together with flesh and muscles

490
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,960
 with primed for purpose, but yet waiting for life

491
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,200
 to then a situation where the breath of God has come

492
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,960
 bringing them to life and therefore to action.

493
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,680
 That three-step process you can find

494
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,080
 throughout the scriptures from this point forward.

495
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,040
 That when God comes with his spirit,

496
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,560
 he takes things that are lost and broken and scattered.

497
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,920
 He draws them together.

498
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,760
 He then fills them with his spirit, his life, his breath,

499
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,840
 his purposes, and then they move forward

500
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,720
 in what it is that God has them to do.

501
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,880
 The most profound example of this, of course,

502
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,640
 is found right there at the end of Jesus's life.

503
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,320
 Remember the moment where he's gathered

504
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,680
 his disciples together,

505
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,600
 and they're still confused at this time.

506
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,520
 They're a little bit overwhelmed

507
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,880
 and they're confused about what's going on.

508
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,920
 And they see Jesus in his resurrected form

509
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,960
 and he takes them up a mountain, all 11 of them.

510
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,280
 Judas is no longer there with them, Judas.

511
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,240
 They're up there on this mountain.

512
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,400
 And this amazing thing happens.

513
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,680
 Jesus gives them the great commandment,

514
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,280
 the great commission, sorry,

515
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,640
 to go out into all the world

516
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,600
 and to preach the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit,

517
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,160
 and to baptize people,

518
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,600
 and to help them to follow all the teachings that God has,

519
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,840
 and I'll be with you forever.

520
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,440
 So they're suddenly, notice this, primed with purpose.

521
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,560
 You with me?

522
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,960
 They're filled with the purposes of God,

523
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,080
 but then he says something to them very importantly.

524
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,160
 He says, "But do not yet go."

525
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,240
 Oh, you're primed for purpose.

526
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,920
 Oh, I've just given you the great commission.

527
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,360
 You know what you need to do.

528
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,440
 But if you try to do it in your own strength,

529
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,320
 if you try to get out there and try to preach my gospel

530
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,600
 without my breath on you, that's not gonna go well.

531
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,640
 So stay in Jerusalem and receive power from on high.

532
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,760
 He says, "You will receive that power

533
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,080
 and then you will be my witnesses."

534
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,280
 If you go before that power, you won't be my witnesses.

535
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,760
 But when you receive that power, that breath, if you will,

536
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,880
 will come upon you, the dry bones will come to life,

537
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,040
 and you will see what I can do through you.

538
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,840
 Remember, it's his miracle still.

539
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,000
 Just like for Ezekiel,

540
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,560
 Ezekiel doesn't bring the bones together, God does that.

541
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,240
 But in partnership with Ezekiel,

542
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,040
 he gets to see the glory of God at work.

543
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,000
 And here's what you can see in the New Testament.

544
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,520
 These disciples who were confused and scared

545
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,280
 and hiding behind locked doors,

546
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,040
 thinking that they might be the next ones crucified,

547
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,200
 they are so filled with the Holy Spirit in Acts chapter two,

548
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,680
 that suddenly they begin to courageously preach the gospel

549
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,000
 and 3,000 are added to their number on the first day alone.

550
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,880
 The fact that you're sitting in this room tonight

551
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,920
 confessing Jesus as your Lord and Savior

552
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,680
 was because they were filled with the breath of God.

553
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:58,320
 This is what Ezekiel sees.

554
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,040
 He sees a vast army stand before him,

555
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,800
 alive with the breath of God,

556
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,520
 primed for the purposes of his kingdom.

557
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
 And here's what I'm sensing God is saying to us at the Vine.

558
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,280
 He's saying, "You guys are primed for purpose.

559
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,000
 2025 is gonna be the most incredible year

560
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,960
 for the church, for you personally,

561
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,480
 for your families, for your work.

562
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,200
 I believe that this is gonna be your greatest year ahead.

563
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,760
 You are primed for purpose.

564
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,200
 I wanna pray for you then.

565
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,800
 I want our pastors and our leaders and our elders

566
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,880
 to lay our hands on you."

567
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,320
 If we really believe this, and this is not just words,

568
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,760
 then we need to put this into action.

569
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,800
 'Cause this is a year of action.

570
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,960
 And so I'm gonna shut up, praise God.

571
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,480
 And in a moment, I'm gonna invite you to come forward

572
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,120
 to be prayed for.

573
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,640
 And we're gonna have about 25 minutes to do this.

574
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,040
 We got plenty of time.

575
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,400
 Now we're not gonna pray for one person for 25 minutes.

576
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,600
 Just wanna be clear.

577
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,840
 We did that, about 30 of you will get prayed for, okay?

578
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,400
 We're gonna pray for a couple of minutes.

579
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,920
 A couple of minutes for the glory of God,

580
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,880
 for the spirit of God to come and to touch your life.

581
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,080
 For some of you in this room,

582
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,840
 this will be the first time that you will feel

583
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,520
 like you've received the Holy Spirit.

584
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
 And I couldn't be more excited for you.

585
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,400
 I want you to be courageous and come forward for prayer.

586
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,080
 For some of you, perhaps you've received

587
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,240
 the Holy Spirit before.

588
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,960
 This is about an empowerment for the purposes

589
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,080
 of which God has for you this year.

590
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,720
 And so it's just inviting us to pray for you for that.

591
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,840
 For some of you, you might have some very specific things

592
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,120
 that you would like prayer for.

593
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,160
 Please share that with us.

594
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,400
 We will pray that the Holy Spirit will empower you

595
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,280
 for whatever it's had.

596
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,360
 This is for everyone.

597
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,640
 In the upper house, we have four of our pastors.

598
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,400
 There'll be two at the front and two at the back.

599
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,520
 We wanna encourage you to get up out of your seat.

600
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,680
 I know it's gonna be messy.

601
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,960
 I know it's gonna be crazy

602
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,080
 'cause the rows are pretty tightly packed up there.

603
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,440
 But if you would like prayer,

604
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,160
 we will be here until every person gets prayed for.

605
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,480
 Upper house, are you okay?

606
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,000
 Upper house, are you okay?

607
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,320
 All right.

608
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,760
 Here at the lower house,

609
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,040
 we've got a whole bunch of pastors and elders

610
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,880
 who are prepared.

611
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,200
 They've been praying for this moment.

612
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,440
 They would love to pray for you.

613
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
 So here's what I would love you to do.

614
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,800
 Let's have everybody stand.

615
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,240
 We're gonna have some worship happening,

616
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,840
 but it's gonna be quiet in the backgrounds

617
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,560
 because this is about prayer right now.

618
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,000
 And so can I invite all the pastors and elders

619
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,160
 and the prayer team to come forward

620
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,920
 just to make themselves available right here in the middle.

621
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,200
 You'll notice that they'll be wearing lanyards.

622
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,240
 So if you would like to receive prayer from someone,

623
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,440
 I wanna encourage you, come on,

624
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,600
 let's not miss this opportunity.

625
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,960
 You're primed for purpose.

626
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,800
 Now the Holy Spirit wants to come and touch you,

627
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,640
 fill you, release you,

628
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,280
 and send you out into the purposes

629
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,160
 for what He has for you in 2025, amen.

630
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,320
 So let me pray for us to begin with.

631
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,000
 And then I wanna encourage you to be courageous

632
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,080
 to come forward for prayer.

633
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,720
 Father, we just thank you so much.

634
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,800
 We thank you that what you did with Ezekiel

635
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,600
 was to change the way that he thought

636
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,080
 about the way in which you worked in this world.

637
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,200
 From that point forward, Lord,

638
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,000
 people began to look for you to step in

639
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,160
 and do what only you can do.

640
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,120
 And we begin to see in the New Testament

641
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,280
 how the disciples who were most of them unlearned,

642
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,960
 not from great backgrounds,

643
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,880
 people that the world would have rejected,

644
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,160
 who become the most courageous and bold people,

645
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,960
 that they would see the gospel eventually

646
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,000
 in just 300 years completely transform

647
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,760
 the Greek Roman Empire.

648
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,040
 Lord, I believe that there is a vast army

649
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,760
 standing in this room right now.

650
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,600
 Children of God who have been called by God

651
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,080
 who are here in Hong Kong.

652
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,080
 And Lord, your city desperately needs a vast army

653
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,320
 filled with courage and boldness

654
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,280
 for the gospel of Jesus Christ.

655
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,880
 So Lord, we pray.

656
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,880
 Lord, we pray.

657
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,960
 So if you'd like prayer, upper house, lower house,

658
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,960
 don't be shy, come on forward,

659
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,320
 and we're gonna pray for you.

660
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,920
 (gentle music)

661
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,520
