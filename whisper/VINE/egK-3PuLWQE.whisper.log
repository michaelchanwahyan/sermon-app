[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   "O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   who mourn in lonely exile here,
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.000]   until the Son of God appears."
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.920]   I wonder if you can hear the longing
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.020]   and the crying out for change
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.200]   that is found in those beautiful lyrics
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.220]   of that famous carol and in the visual imagery
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.480]   that our creative team created in that opener for you.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.460]   Because this longing, this crying out
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.740]   for the Son of God to appear
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.680]   is what sits at the very heart of the Advent season
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.880]   that we enter into today and over the coming Sundays
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.280]   that lead up to Christmas morning.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.980]   Advent itself is driven actually
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.040]   from the Latin word adventus,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.600]   which literally means arrival or coming.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.200]   And here at The Vine over the last many, many years,
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.720]   we've always celebrated this idea
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.120]   that we must prepare ourselves as a church
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.560]   for the arrival of Jesus who is born on Christmas day.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.680]   And so Advent in our celebrations here at The Vine,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.720]   for as far back as I can remember,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.000]   have always been about this thought
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   that Christ was born on Christmas day
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.680]   and we need to prepare ourselves for his arrival.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.560]   And so all of our sermon series
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.080]   and everything we've kind of preached during this season
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.680]   has been out of the gospels,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.560]   out of the story in Matthew and Luke
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.080]   of Jesus's birth and the prophetic ways
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.240]   in which that birth happens
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.400]   and the miraculous things that take place in that moment.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.560]   But here's the reality.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.240]   The birth of Jesus is actually just one side
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.280]   of the whole Advent story.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.860]   In fact, the season of Advent historically
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.120]   in the global church for over 2000 years
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.320]   actually contains two sides to its story.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.560]   Yes, it is the side of the story
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.720]   of the arrival of Jesus as a child in Bethlehem,
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.880]   in the manger and everything that we've celebrated usually,
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.920]   but it is also the story of Jesus coming back
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.840]   to the world again at the end of all things
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.640]   as a conquering king.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.560]   Advent, if you will, holds intention
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.880]   these two parts of the Christmas story.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.640]   Christmas, you may not realize,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.840]   is not just about the birth of Jesus.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.780]   The birth of Jesus starts the redemptive story
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.620]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.000]   And so Advent as a season for the church
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.460]   also looks forward in longing for the reality
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.200]   of the return of Jesus at the end of all things.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.320]   And when he comes back, he will, if you will,
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.680]   complete that total story of redemption,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.540]   of humanity and creation.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.240]   Advent is the wonder of longing
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.640]   for Christmas to be complete.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.640]   It celebrates the birth and the return of Jesus.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.840]   If you will, Advent is kind of emphasizing the bookends
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.800]   around the redemptive story of Christ,
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.920]   his birth and his return with the idea
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.720]   that if you could really understand
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.020]   what is there at the end of all things,
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.640]   if you can really understand what it's like
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.520]   to long for Christ to come and step back into this world,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.800]   if you can understand that, that actually critically
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.200]   helps you to fully understand what happens on Christmas day.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.040]   Or I would say it a little bit more challenging
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.960]   to you in this way.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.160]   If you really want to live as best you can
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.800]   as a Christian in this day's world,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.000]   you don't need to know just only
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.800]   how your Christian story began,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.400]   you also need to know how it will end.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   For once you see what Christ does at the end of all things,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.040]   it makes everything that happens now
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.120]   come in to the right focus.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.400]   I don't know about you, but I'm the sort of person
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.680]   that actually enjoys watching a movie
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.360]   the second time more than the first time.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.840]   Is anyone else like that?
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.040]   Like when I watch a movie for the first time,
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.000]   I have no idea how that movie's going to end.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.680]   And of course that creates an excitement
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.840]   when you're watching it, you're wondering
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.640]   how it's all gonna turn out at the end,
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.080]   but it also, at least for me,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.800]   creates a little bit of anxiety.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.840]   I don't know how this is all gonna play out,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.200]   and I don't know if it's gonna end
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.960]   in a way that I'm gonna be happy with.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.240]   Will it all resolve?
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.560]   Will I leave the theater at the end of watching the movie
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.040]   feeling like all my expectations were met?
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.280]   And so when I watch a movie for the first time,
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.600]   I'm kind of excited, I'm kind of nervous,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.280]   I don't know how it's gonna turn out.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.360]   When I watch it the second time, I know how it ends.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.200]   And because I know how it ends, it informs so much
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.800]   of how I watch it for that second, third, fourth,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.040]   or fifth time.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.120]   It's fascinating to me that when I know
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.360]   how the movie's gonna end and resolve itself,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.080]   I actually enjoy it so much more.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.840]   And I get to see all the little nuances
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.600]   that I missed the first time I watched it.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.780]   All those little things that the director included
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.600]   about characterizations and conversations
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.200]   and little plot turns and twists
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.960]   that actually when you've seen it before,
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.080]   you watch it and you go, ah, I know what that's really about.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.040]   Oh, I know what's gonna happen to that character
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.200]   later on, right?
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.400]   And it brings this whole different perspective
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.920]   to the movie as a whole.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.960]   I found for me when I watch a movie a second or third time,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.800]   when I know how it ends, I actually find more purpose
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.480]   and joy in the journey itself.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.860]   And I think it's exactly the same for the Bible,
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.520]   for our scriptures.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.160]   I wonder if you've ever wondered why the Bible
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.320]   doesn't finish with the letters of the New Testament,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.480]   these incredible letters that the writers write
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.080]   about how to live now in the reality of the life,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.720]   death and resurrection of Jesus
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.000]   and letters that were written by the apostles
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.800]   into the churches to help them to understand
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.280]   what life is like now because of all that.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.140]   Why didn't the Bible just finish with those letters?
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.360]   No, it doesn't.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.960]   The Bible actually finishes with this crazy revelation
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.360]   that God gives John on the island of Patmos
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.420]   where he sees this apocalyptic vision
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.000]   of what the end of the world is going to be like.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.960]   And he writes down all these crazy imageries
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.080]   and all these things that he senses God has given him.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.200]   And right at the end of that book
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.320]   in chapters 21 and 22 of Revelations,
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.920]   John shows us what our end of the movie is like.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.400]   And he paints this beautiful picture
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.880]   of how all the world is gonna be made new
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.520]   under this new Jerusalem that comes down to earth.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.860]   And he shows us this picture of a new city coming down
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.200]   from heaven to earth, fulfilling Jesus's prayer
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.800]   when the disciples said, "How should we pray?"
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.160]   He says, "Pray that heaven will come to earth."
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.840]   And we see in Revelation 21 and 22
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.760]   that that's exactly what happens.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.400]   Heaven literally comes to earth in this new city.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.200]   And we find Jesus in the fullness of his presence
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.240]   living for all eternity in that city.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.620]   And not only that, but in those last chapters,
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.880]   we see that every tribe and every tongue,
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.440]   every race and every background
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.480]   is there in unity together, praising God.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.360]   And not only that, but because God is there in his fullness,
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.940]   we suddenly see the end of poverty,
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.560]   the end of pain, the end of suffering,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.080]   the end of need for anything other
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.060]   than the incredible presence of God.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.520]   We see the end of sin, literally,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.800]   and therefore the end of death.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.400]   And all that is in this city is a river that flows,
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.880]   a river of life.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.160]   And there are trees on either side of this river
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.340]   and there are leaves for the healing of the nation
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.440]   and everybody who's a part of this city
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.320]   knows for the final time for the rest of their lives,
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.160]   the fullness of Shalom,
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.040]   what the peace of the Lord is all about.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.220]   It's a glorious vision.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.920]   And the Bible finishes on that vision.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.640]   It's almost like God is peeling the curtain back
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.800]   and going, "Hey, this is how the movie ends."
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.360]   And in the same way that I enjoy movies so much more
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.240]   when I know how they're gonna end,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.300]   'cause I can find more purpose in my joy of watching it,
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.900]   so I think God pulls the curtain back
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.980]   and shows us the end of all things,
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.900]   shows us Christ returning so that we can find more purpose
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.480]   and joy in how we live today.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.300]   That, my friends, is Advent.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.720]   That is the joy of this season.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.300]   You see, the way we live today is not just informed
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.180]   by what we read in the Gospels.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.740]   As important as the Gospels are,
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.220]   it's not just informed by what we see in the life
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.820]   and the death and the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.540]   Actually, the Bible presents to us
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.780]   another way of understanding how to live today.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.080]   It's done by seeing what is gonna happen
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.180]   at the end of all things
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.700]   and wanting to live on behalf of that vision today,
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.020]   saying, "If this is the future that we're heading into,
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.020]   "then how can I live today with purpose,
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.240]   "with promise that gives honor to the future
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.320]   "that God is gonna bring to all of creation?"
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.860]   So listen to this, church.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.460]   Anytime that you fight for justice today,
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.580]   anytime you care for the poor, you give to the needy,
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.740]   you walk with the broken, you stand for the abused,
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.380]   you help the vulnerable,
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.100]   anytime that you liberate the oppressed,
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.820]   anytime that you find yourself being a voice of peace
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.580]   and collaboration and unity amongst people
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.980]   that don't like each other,
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.780]   you're beginning to live as if God's future is now.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.740]   You're beginning to stand in such a way
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.260]   that you say, "Advent matters.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.940]   "This longing that I have inside of me
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.740]   "for the coming of Christ again,
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.800]   "I can begin to show the world
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.540]   "what that place will look like."
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.380]   We can't create it now,
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.580]   but we can begin to prophetically live in such a way
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.260]   that people would say, "That's a future
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.780]   "I wanna be a part of."
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.740]   Oh, I'm getting excited.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.820]   You're not, but I am, that's okay.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.380]   That's because we wanna live
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.100]   on behalf of this grand vision today.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.500]   This, my friends, is Advent.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.740]   Not only the celebration of a Savior
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.500]   who stepped into the world as a child,
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.740]   but also the longing for the future arrival of a Savior
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.060]   who will step back into the world as a king,
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.260]   and then living on behalf of both of those realities today.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.060]   That is Christmas.
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.700]   Christmas is so much more
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.540]   than just the reality of Jesus coming as this child.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.060]   Christmas opens up for us a much bigger, wider,
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.180]   larger, redemptive narrative
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.660]   that when we celebrate
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.700]   in what has been pulled back from that curtain,
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.900]   and we know how the movie ends,
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.740]   and we live on behalf of both the birth
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.980]   and the return of Christ,
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.900]   we begin to show the world something different.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.380]   Christmas should be the most transformative season
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.820]   in the life of the church than any season,
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:05.300]   because it is Christmas that our story begins
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.740]   and leads us towards its ultimate culmination.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.540]   So it shouldn't surprise us
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.940]   that when the New Testament writers
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.460]   are writing about the life and the death
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.420]   and resurrection of Christ,
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.980]   and when they're writing the letters to the churches
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.300]   to encourage them,
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.660]   that there's this growing sense among the early church
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.740]   that they're desperate for the story
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.180]   to have its completion,
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.380]   that they're desperate for Christ to return.
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.340]   And so the New Testament is filled
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.420]   with all of these different speeches
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.980]   and ideas and writings about this return of Christ.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.420]   There's a longing in the early church
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.380]   that Jesus would come back,
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.020]   because they realize that despite the fact
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.900]   that Jesus has been here in his life,
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.300]   death, and resurrection,
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.020]   despite the fact of his ascension
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.980]   and the sending of the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.140]   there's still something that's unfinished in the story,
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.620]   not unfinished in the idea of salvation.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.140]   It's important that you get this.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.700]   See, salvation has been received to us in its fullness
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.620]   in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.740]   Sin is conquered, sin has been overcome,
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.020]   and anybody who gives their life to Jesus
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.860]   and asks for the forgiveness of their sins
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.100]   is fully saved by him.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.660]   Yet we also realize, don't we,
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.940]   that there's still an influence of sin on our lives.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.780]   There's still an influence of sin in the world around us.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.580]   And you see, the early church felt this.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.820]   They saw the profundity and the power of salvation
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.900]   here in its fullness,
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.860]   and yet they recognized that there was still
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.900]   so much brokenness, sometimes within them,
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.820]   and a lot of times within their world.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.380]   And they therefore cried out,
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.100]   Lord, if you could just return
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.780]   and do what you have promised that you will do,
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.540]   everything will find its rightful place.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.260]   This is why right at the end of our scriptures,
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.700]   literally the very last thing that's written
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.740]   at the end of the Bible in Revelations 22,
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.340]   starting in verse 20, it says this.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.020]   "He who testifies to these things says,"
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.340]   this is Jesus speaking, "Yes, I am coming soon.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.780]   "Amen, come, Lord Jesus."
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.100]   Our Bibles finish on this incredible prayer,
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.340]   Maranatha it is in its original text,
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.020]   which means come, Lord Jesus.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.340]   And if you were here last week,
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.380]   you'll remember this is not the come, Lord Jesus
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.980]   in the sense that right now,
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.780]   we don't have enough of your presence.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.900]   We said last week, right,
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.260]   that the fullness of the presence of God is in us
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.340]   as we come to relationship with Christ.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.660]   The fullness of the presence of God is in this world
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.220]   in its omnipotence.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.460]   This is not a crying out for more of some sort
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.180]   of momentary infilling.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.860]   This Maranatha, come, Lord Jesus,
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.700]   is a crying out for Christ to return,
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.780]   crying out for that Revelation 21, 22 picture
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.580]   so that the world would know the shalom
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.140]   that God has always promised it.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.780]   This is the church saying, we are not satisfied.
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.980]   There is more.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:10.460]   I love this idea because when the New Testament writers
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.460]   write about this, they understand that the world
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.900]   is still not quite as God desires it to be.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.260]   And this fueled their evangelism.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.100]   This fueled their compassion.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.460]   This is why they were just and hopeful.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.740]   This is why they spoke into all areas
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.740]   of the Greek Roman society.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.060]   This is why the gospel went out from Jerusalem,
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.540]   Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the world
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.900]   because they realized that they had a role to play,
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.980]   that because Christ is coming back,
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.660]   because there is the river of life,
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.380]   because sin will be gone, because all the nations
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.020]   will come together and worship God,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.460]   there is work to do today.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.180]   So if Christmas is anything for us,
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.580]   if Advent is anything for us,
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.100]   it should be the most mobilizing season
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.180]   that the church experiences.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.980]   It should light a fire inside of us to say,
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.020]   there's a story that needs to be told to this world
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.460]   because right now we're sitting between these two bookends.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.340]   He's come, He is coming.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.300]   And we're in this moment,
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.140]   which is one of the most precious moments of history
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:28.140]   where we've seen Him, we know Him, and He will come again.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:33.380]   The New Testament and scholars,
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.780]   as they've studied the scriptures,
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.220]   they've coined this term that we all live in
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.980]   as this idea of the now but not yet.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.140]   It's an academic term, but it's helpful, I think.
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.420]   The now but not yet is the season that we're in.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.420]   The now but not yet is the longing and the cry of Advent.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.740]   Now in the sense that Christ has come,
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.980]   and as Carla shared during our communion time,
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.540]   was on the cross and said those words, it is finished.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.700]   That the wages of sin are death,
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.700]   but because of Christ and His resurrection,
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.500]   those wages have been paid for.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.420]   We now know the fullness of life in relation to Him.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.460]   It is done, that's the now.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.260]   But yet there is this not yet.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260]   There is the reality that sin is still at work,
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.100]   there is this reality
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.820]   that we still see brokenness in the world.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.740]   There is this reality that people still suffer,
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.460]   that there is still death,
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.420]   and that longing inside of us for that reality
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.940]   that we see at the end of Revelation 21 and 22,
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.740]   and that glorious picture of the return of Christ.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.140]   That sits on our hearts together as well.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.780]   And so we're in the now, we're in this not yet,
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.700]   and as we sit in the middle of that,
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.820]   that's where we find Advent.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:49.340]   That's where the Maranatha cries from our spirit.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:55.500]   Come, Lord Jesus, 'cause I wanna see my family revived.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.180]   Come, Lord Jesus, 'cause I wanna see my businesses.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.580]   I wanna see the workplace.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.900]   I wanna see everybody that I know know you.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.260]   Come, Lord Jesus.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.700]   This is the crazy thing about the now but not yet.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.500]   Christ is coming again.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.860]   And because he's coming again,
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.820]   that should change everything now.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.220]   There's so many ways of thinking about this in Scripture,
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.220]   but I wanna read you one of the passages
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.820]   that I find most helpful,
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.140]   particularly when it comes to the idea
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.980]   of Christmas and Advent.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.580]   And this is found in Paul's writings
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.940]   in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.340]   And if you're just journeying
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.460]   or beginning your journey of faith here,
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.380]   maybe this passage is well-known to you
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.860]   just from the weddings you've attended.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.060]   It's often the passage that's read at weddings.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.420]   If you've been a Christian here for many years,
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.540]   you'll know this passage.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.740]   The first seven verses are this beautiful chorus about love,
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.860]   and it's one of the most celebrated sections
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.260]   of Scripture that we have.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.380]   But I wanna read the following verses
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.460]   after those first seven.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.820]   This is verses eight to 13.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.540]   And in these verses, we see a slightly different story.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.980]   In fact, Paul goes from this glorious idea of what love is
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.060]   to the reality of the now but not yet time
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.380]   that we're living in.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.660]   And when you read them, it feels a little bit jarring,
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.820]   but when you open up what Paul's trying to say,
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.820]   everything begins to fit together.
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.540]   These verses I'm about to read, if you will,
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.380]   if you're here and you have an older sibling,
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.140]   and this happens quite a lot in our culture in Asia,
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.340]   if you've got an older sibling
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.660]   and your parents think that the sun shines out of them
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.740]   all the time, and you've always felt like
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.880]   you're in the shadow of your older sibling,
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.340]   then you'll resonate with these verses, okay?
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.700]   'Cause these verses are in the shadow
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.460]   of that amazing section on love,
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.060]   but there is so much wonder here.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.260]   Let me read this to you.
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.340]   1 Corinthians 13, starting in verse eight.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.500]   Love never fails, but where there are prophecies,
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.900]   they will cease.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.100]   Where there are tongues, they will be stilled.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.020]   Where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.380]   Notice this, for we know in part and we prophesy in part.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.720]   But then he says this, but when perfection comes,
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.820]   the imperfect disappears.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.660]   You see, when I was a child, I taught like a child,
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.260]   I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child,
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.340]   but when I became a man,
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.320]   I put these childish ways behind me.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.700]   Now we see, but a poor reflection as in a mirror,
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.940]   then we will see face to face.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.220]   Now I know in part, then I shall know fully,
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.940]   even as I am fully known.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:24.740]   And these three things remain, faith, hope, and love.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.140]   But the greatest of these is love.
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.760]   I love how Paul begins this,
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.820]   this whole section he's speaking about the now,
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.860]   but not yet tension of how Christ has come,
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.100]   and yet we long for him to come again.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.340]   Look at what he says at the start.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.260]   He says, love never fails,
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.280]   but where there are prophecies, they will cease.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.040]   Where there is tongues, they will be stilled.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.640]   Where there is knowledge, it's gonna pass away.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.340]   For we know in part, we prophesy in part,
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.660]   but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.420]   He's saying this, look, we need to understand
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.220]   that we're longing for a time where perfection comes.
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.420]   He's speaking there metaphorically
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.980]   about the return of Jesus.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.200]   And when perfection comes, all this imperfect stuff
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.080]   that we're feeling right now, it disappears.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.000]   And he names some really amazing things.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.520]   He talks about prophecy,
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.680]   and he talks about wisdom and knowledge,
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.040]   but he says, you need to understand
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.680]   that even in the prophetic,
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.280]   even in the wisdom and the knowledge,
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.320]   we only prophesy and we only know in part.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.480]   We don't know everything he's saying to the church.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.280]   We can't because we're in this now, but not yet.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.040]   There's a longing and there's a crying out
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.740]   because we don't have all the answers,
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.300]   that there are these gaps.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.720]   We don't know it all he's saying.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.720]   But when perfection comes, everything that's imperfect,
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.800]   even all the lack of knowledge and all that goes
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.560]   because suddenly perfection is with us.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.640]   He comments again, let me read this to you in verse 12.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.760]   He says it this way.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.840]   He says, "Now, in this time of now, but not yet,
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.480]   "we see, but a poor reflection is in a mirror.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.320]   "But then when Christ returns, we will see face to face.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.700]   "Now I only know in part, then I shall know fully,
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.900]   "even though right now I am fully known."
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.100]   This is so profound.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.860]   I want you to remember, this is Paul writing to his church.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.500]   Paul, who previously was the Hebrew of Hebrews,
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.620]   was one of the most learned people
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.100]   in the Jewish religion of his day.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.340]   He prided himself on the knowledge of scripture
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.500]   and the knowledge of understanding of who God is,
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.780]   his character and his life.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.820]   That was what he celebrated.
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.980]   And he has the humility now,
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.920]   now that he's come into relationship with Jesus,
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.700]   now he's come to understand the birth
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.380]   and yet the second coming.
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.020]   Now he's come to realize the now, but not yet
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.860]   that he's sitting in.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.020]   He has the humility to write to his church
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.700]   and says, "I know only in part."
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.180]   I don't have it all figured out.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.320]   I love this.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.260]   This frees me as a pastor, 'cause I can stand before you
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.180]   and say, "I don't have it all figured out."
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.900]   'Cause if the apostle Paul didn't have it figured out,
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.180]   I don't have it figured out either.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.020]   He writes to his church.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.540]   Now remember, 1 Corinthians is a letter Paul's writing
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.180]   in reply to another letter that Paul's written,
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.000]   sorry, that the church wrote Paul.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.140]   We don't have a copy of that letter,
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.780]   but the letter that the church wrote Paul
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.540]   had a list of all these questions in it for him.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.660]   And in 1 Corinthians 13,
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.660]   he does try to answer some of those questions.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.820]   But then in this section, he says,
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.500]   "But you need to understand, church,
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.660]   "even though I'll do my best to give you some wisdom here,
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.120]   "we only prophesy in part.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.740]   "We only are wise in part.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.060]   "I don't know it all," he's saying.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.820]   In other words, there are going to,
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.100]   in this now but not yet season,
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.500]   there's going to be gaps, gaps in our knowledge,
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.880]   gaps in our prophecy, gaps in our understanding,
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.820]   gaps in our vision.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.420]   We're not gonna have it all sorted out.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.980]   But then he says this, "One day when he returns,
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.620]   "we will see face to face,
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.860]   "and in that moment, I will know it all.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.700]   "But right now, I don't."
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.060]   But then he says this crazy thing.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.280]   He goes this, he's kinda like,
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.480]   I almost feel like as he's writing this,
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.960]   he leans into the church.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.120]   He leans in and goes, "But guess what?
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.700]   "I know one who does know it all.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.540]   "'Cause although right now, I don't have all the answers.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.860]   "Although right now, there are gaps for me,
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.200]   "there is one that I know who is coming back.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.000]   "And when he comes back, we're all gonna know.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.140]   "But right now, even though I don't know everything,
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.000]   "he right now knows everything.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.620]   "He right now has all the answers.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.700]   "He right now can step in and show himself to his fullness.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.120]   "I may be seeing in a mirror slightly darkly.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.380]   "There's no filter for God," he's saying to the church.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.260]   "There's no break for him.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.780]   "He sees everything fully right now."
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.980]   And it's almost like Paul is saying,
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:39.020]   it is okay for me not to know everything,
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.620]   because I know the one who does.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.740]   Okay, let me break this down for you a little bit more,
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.860]   'cause I wanna show you really the beauty of this,
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.060]   and then show you how this links into Advent.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.500]   Has this been helping so far?
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.460]   I'm glad I came back.
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.220]   I'm just gonna go back to Spain.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.620]   Walk another 800, no, okay.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:06.500]   All right, so I apologize up front for my writing,
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.580]   but follow this, okay.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.620]   Here's what Paul is saying in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.100]   He's basically going, look, he's like,
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.260]   there is this world right now that we all know,
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.460]   and this world is kinda messed up.
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.460]   The word he uses, he says, it's imperfect, right?
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.140]   There's this imperfection that's happening right now
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.500]   in our world, but then he says,
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.300]   you also need to understand that there's this world
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.500]   that's coming when Christ returns.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.180]   This is gonna look like a sun, but it's not.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.660]   It's the amazing, redeemed, and renewed world
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.620]   that Christ is in the center of.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.660]   And he says, this world, this time, is perfect.
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.260]   So right now, he's saying, we know imperfection
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.740]   in the future when Christ returns,
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.260]   everything will be perfect.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.540]   And he's basically saying, we live right now
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.860]   in this now, but not yet tension
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.740]   between these two times.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.580]   This is the lot for every human being right now.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.900]   We're sitting in between the imperfect that we know,
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.060]   the fact that I don't know it all,
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.380]   that there are gaps for me,
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.700]   and this perfect return of Christ that's gonna happen.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.740]   And he basically says, you need to understand
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.180]   that there, in this time, there are gaps.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.700]   There are gaps for all of us, Paul is saying.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.740]   And the reason why he's trying to teach his church this,
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.940]   the reason why I'm trying to teach you it here this morning
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.820]   is because it's actually in these gaps
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.220]   where Advent is found.
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.860]   Let me explain that.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.860]   If you're anything like me, and I'm sure you are,
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.420]   we don't like the gaps.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.620]   The gaps during the now, but not yet time
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.260]   are the hardest things about this time.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.100]   I don't know about you,
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.260]   but I wish I did have all the answers.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.860]   But there are gaps, and there are gaps in our lives.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.260]   Things happen that we have no control of.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.220]   Something takes place in our work that we can't explain.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.620]   There's a breakdown in a relationship, and it's hurt us.
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.100]   There are wounds that we're carrying
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.900]   that we don't seem to get healed from.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.300]   There are questions that we're holding on our hearts
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.220]   that don't seem to get answered.
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.260]   There's stuff that we've been doing with God
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.820]   that we thought would bring a breakthrough
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.540]   doesn't seem to be a breakthrough.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.580]   There are gaps, Paul is saying,
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.660]   between the time of the imperfect
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.500]   and this perfection that will come.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.700]   But we so as human beings don't like the gaps
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.580]   that here's what we do in the gaps.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.220]   We try to fill them with ourselves.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.380]   We try to look within ourselves to try to fill the gaps.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.060]   In other words, we want to control
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.900]   what Paul is saying here is uncontrollable.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.900]   We wanna try to fill those gaps.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.460]   So for example, I don't know, Lord,
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.860]   when I'm gonna get a job, how am I gonna get a job?
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.940]   And we try our very best and we get so stressed
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.500]   of trying to work things out.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.420]   Or I don't know, Lord, how I'm gonna save my marriage
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.940]   and we're trying our best, but we can't sort it all out.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.100]   We work really hard and we get ourselves
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.180]   into places of worry, anxiety, stress, depression,
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.300]   because there are gaps, we don't like gaps,
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.460]   and we're trying to fill the gaps with ourselves.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.980]   Are you with me?
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.500]   And what Paul's writing to the church is,
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.580]   no, you gotta understand, we live in the now but not yet.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.220]   This is the cry of Advent.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.700]   You wanna know what Advent is?
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.140]   Advent is standing in the gap
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.260]   and not trying to solve it yourself.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.060]   Advent is standing in the gap and crying out and going,
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.340]   I know in part, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.580]   What it means is that I know the one who knows it all.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.660]   The gap is where the carol comes.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.660]   Oh come, oh come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:45.180]   who mourn in lonely exile here in the gap,
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.180]   waiting until the Son of God appears.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:54.580]   Maranatha, come Lord Jesus, is not an escapism.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.620]   It's not some sort of whimsical idea.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:02.020]   It is the cry of those that live in the gaps
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.700]   who are saying I know and trust and believe
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.700]   that there is one who can set all things right.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.900]   The gaps are an opportunity, yes,
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.620]   for us to potentially worry and get stressed
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.100]   and overwhelmed and depressed,
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.500]   but the gaps are also one of the most profound invitations
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.660]   you will ever have to a greater relationship with God.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:27.900]   Could it be that God has given us this now but not yet time
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.920]   and given us these gaps that we like to try to control
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.980]   and fill so that we can't control and fill them,
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.500]   but instead discover Him?
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:43.400]   That, my friends, I believe, is what Christmas is all about.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.140]   It's what Advent is.
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.280]   And here's the crazy thing.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.420]   Paul goes, and you know what?
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.700]   God in His mercy hasn't left us alone
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.700]   trying to maybe some people might be able
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.740]   to work this out, some won't.
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.940]   He says there's actually three things that God has given us
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.280]   that are values, vehicles, ways in which we can reach out
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.520]   beyond ourselves towards Him who knows it all.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.880]   Verse 13, and now these three things remain,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.120]   faith, hope, and love.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.720]   The greatest of these, he says, is love.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.040]   This is Paul basically saying you've gotta understand
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.480]   something that's really, really important here.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.720]   He said in the place of these gaps, there is faith,
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   there is faith, there is hope, there is love.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.960]   We may not have all the answers,
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.660]   we may not be able to always get all the answers,
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.940]   but it is not that God stands back,
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.140]   looks at our gaps in our lives, and goes,
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.040]   (laughing)
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.540]   Paul's saying, no, no, we're not alone in the gaps.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.580]   We have the gaps.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.420]   I don't know it all, He knows it all.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.620]   One day I will know it all.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.060]   When He comes back, I hope He comes back soon,
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.660]   but in this moment, He's deposited by His Spirit
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.260]   and by His church and in His Word three things
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.740]   that enable me not to have all the answers,
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.020]   but enable me to reach out of myself and towards Him,
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.820]   enable the gaps to become a place of advent,
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.980]   of longing, of wishing, of hoping for the arrival of God.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.460]   Faith inside of me that believes
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.100]   that He wasn't just born in that manger as a child,
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.140]   but He will come back, and that the curtain
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.620]   that is being pulled back in Revelation 21 and 22
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.460]   is not just some fantastic idea,
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.500]   it's the literal thing that will happen
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.580]   at the end of all things.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.620]   Hope, hope that that story is part of my story.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.860]   Hope that even when I feel a long way away from the coming,
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.820]   I can trust that God will do what He says He's gonna do.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.100]   Love, love that so fills me and changes me,
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.580]   that because I know He was born, I know He's coming back,
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.900]   and I know He's here in the fullness
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.780]   in His presence right now, I have a place to know
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.420]   and feel and encounter love, and because He first loved me,
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.380]   I can now love.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.700]   That's why this is the greatest of the three,
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.780]   because I now can walk in the love of Christ
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.020]   to all those around me, and if I really want to advent well,
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:12.740]   then it's found in how I love true and well.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.980]   Faith, hope, and love.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.900]   Paul says this is it, and I think that's
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.980]   the most beautiful summary of what advent is all about.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.380]   This bookends of Christ's redemptive story
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:32.180]   that welcomes us in to the reality that there are gaps, yes,
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.140]   and that those gaps are hard and uncomfortable, yes,
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:40.820]   but those gaps can lead us to the one who knows it all.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.620]   If there's not a better message for Christmas,
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.300]   then I don't know what there is,
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.420]   and my prayer is that you will go
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.140]   into your workplace tomorrow and go,
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.940]   let me tell you about the bookends,
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.300]   because now I know about the bookends.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.180]   Let me tell you about the gaps.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.180]   You've got a gap, I've got a gap.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.700]   We've all got gaps, but those gaps
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.980]   don't have to be the end for you.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.220]   They're not the end for me, and although maybe
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.580]   those gaps don't get answered the way
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:02.740]   I think they're gonna get answered,
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.500]   those gaps are an invitation to find the God of the gaps.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:12.580]   So here's what I wanna encourage you to do this week.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.940]   I wanna help you to just reframe some things in your mind,
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.300]   to find that longing inside of you
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.980]   that is what advent is all about,
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.660]   and over the next three Sundays,
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.940]   we're gonna take faith, hope, and love,
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.900]   and we're gonna use these three themes
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.740]   as the center point for understanding
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.220]   both the birth of Christ, 'cause those three things,
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.340]   faith, hope, and love, are framed in the birth of Christ,
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.500]   and then see how they are framed in his second coming,
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.580]   and as we do that, I pray that you will encounter
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.580]   more faith and hope and love in the now,
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.260]   but not yet in between.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.140]   So to get you prepared for that,
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.580]   here's a little exercise I want you to do this week,
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:50.380]   and by the way, when I say I want you to do it,
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.940]   I actually mean that I want you to do it.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.340]   I don't want you just to take a photo of the slide
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.180]   and go, "That was a nice sermon today."
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.820]   I actually want you to do it,
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.660]   because I think it can help change your heart
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.140]   and get you ready for advent.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.340]   So I'm gonna kinda get out of the way,
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.020]   and you can take a photo of this next slide,
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.860]   but let me read you these four reflections
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.340]   I want you to think about this week.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.440]   Where and what are the gaps in this now,
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.780]   but not yet time that overwhelm me or overwhelm you?
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.000]   What are some of the longings that sit within you
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.240]   that are far beyond your own ability to achieve?
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.820]   Where do you see in your own life
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.020]   the tension between the fullness of salvation received,
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.900]   and yet the reality of the ongoing work of sin?
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.180]   Okay, that's a very personal one for you.
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.680]   What burdens do you carry for yourself,
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.260]   others, or this world
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.540]   that burn a righteous justice within you?
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.980]   That's the positive thing.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.140]   That's the, "Hey, let's fight for injustice now.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.100]   "Let's make this work.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.860]   "Let's stand for the poor and the needy."
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.480]   What burdens sit within you
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.900]   that are like a cry of your heart to help those around you?
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.740]   That's the cry of advent.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:01.660]   In the same way, what sin still overwhelms me at time
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.040]   and seems to have a grip on me,
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.660]   even though I know it's fully paid for,
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.980]   but it still seems to have a grip on me,
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.100]   the honesty of that, that's also advent.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.700]   So it's this beautiful reflection
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.580]   that we can find in ourselves
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.420]   that helps to trigger our understanding
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.880]   of where we're at as we enter into this Christmas season,
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.500]   where we look at both the birth
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.700]   and the return of our Savior.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.340]   Does that sound helpful to you?
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.700]   All right, can we just pray together?
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.520]   Let's pray.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:33.740]   Father, as we enter into the season of advent
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.580]   here at The Vine,
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.900]   and as we focus on faith, hope, and love in the weeks ahead,
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.860]   as we celebrate your birth,
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.000]   understand this longing we should have for your return,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.900]   putting those two things into balance
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.260]   as bookends around your redemptive story,
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.020]   and as we find ourselves as Paul
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.560]   has so beautifully shown us this morning,
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.980]   the gaps that are there,
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.420]   and yet the liberation we can have from fear,
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.700]   anxiety, worry, depression, from not knowing it all,
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.780]   and instead the gaps being a springboard,
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:10.700]   a catalyst towards greater trust, faith, hope, love with you.
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.580]   Father, that's my prayer for every person here at The Vine
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.620]   and everybody watching online in this moment.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.860]   My prayer is that they would find themselves
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.800]   catalyzed at advent this year,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.140]   to find that longing inside of them,
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.120]   the crying out within them for the Son of God to appear,
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:34.060]   that the gaps that they are very aware of
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.300]   in their lives right now,
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.300]   where anxiety and fear and worry
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.940]   has been the thing that has driven their sense of the need
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.540]   to control the gaps in their lives.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.780]   I wanna pray for releasing right now in the name of Jesus.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.340]   I wanna pray that this advent season
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.260]   will be a shift for many in this room,
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.060]   for many watching online.
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.060]   I believe that where the gaps have created anxiety,
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:01.760]   the gaps are now gonna create faith in the name of Jesus.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.000]   The gaps are now gonna birth hope in their hearts
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.500]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.960]   The gaps are gonna create a deeper love for you
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.360]   and for others around them in the name of Jesus.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.980]   What the enemy has stolen from the gaps.
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.020]   Lord, I pray that you would recatalyze
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.140]   by your spirit amongst the vine over the next three weeks.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.980]   Lord, I pray that you would light that advent fire in us,
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.060]   that we would look forward to celebrating your birth
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.200]   in the manger of Bethlehem that night,
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.500]   but we would also long for your return as a reigning king.
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.400]   And that would fuel and drive our purpose and our ministry
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.100]   and our sharing of the gospel with our friends and family
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.780]   of all the action that you're calling us to do.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.940]   And it would more than anything catalyze the gaps.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.700]   Where we say like Paul would humble himself
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.500]   before his church and say, I don't have all the answers,
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.740]   but I know the one who does.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.140]   And Lord, if there's anyone in this room
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.580]   or watching online right now,
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.800]   where they would say they don't know that God.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.860]   Father, I wanna pray that this moment right here
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.500]   and the moments over advent as we lead up
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.300]   to the celebration of the birth of Jesus
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.820]   would be a birthing moment for them.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.460]   Your scriptures speak about a new birth,
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.140]   that we become a new creation in you
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.220]   when we come into relationship with you.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.320]   So Lord, I wanna pray anyone in this room,
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.020]   maybe they've been invited here today
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.580]   by a friend or a family member.
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:32.300]   And maybe as they think about Christmas,
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.260]   they've always wondered what's this really about?
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.220]   Is it just about buying things?
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.220]   Is it just commercial?
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.060]   Is it just material?
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.420]   And they're here today realizing
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.140]   that it's about a much bigger story,
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.340]   a story that they're swept up in,
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.980]   that they are caught up in.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.100]   And if you're sitting here right now
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.020]   and you don't know Jesus,
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.140]   you are caught up in this crazy story,
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.880]   whether you realize it or not.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.860]   And the Bible tells us that Christ is returning
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.160]   and that we will see him one day face to face.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.420]   My prayer for you is that you,
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.060]   as you face him face to face,
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.380]   he would say to you, well done,
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.500]   my good and faithful son or daughter,
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.900]   my good and faithful child.
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.540]   And he will welcome you into that incredible city
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.540]   where for all eternity,
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.020]   you will be able to spend with him.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.140]   And so I wanna pray just as our eyes are closed,
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.780]   heads are bowed,
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.820]   if anyone in this room,
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.020]   that's your desire today.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.020]   You've heard what we've been talking about today
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.060]   and you're like, you know what?
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.780]   I realize that the gaps in my life
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.820]   are causing more anxiety in me than I would need.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.060]   And I want the gaps to be filled with something else.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.260]   I want that faith,
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.140]   that hope and that love that Andrew was speaking about.
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.740]   Well, I want you to know that that's available to you
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:44.780]   right in this moment.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.740]   And while the journey of being a Christian
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.740]   is a lifelong journey,
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.740]   it begins with a simple prayer.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.260]   It's a prayer that just acknowledges
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.940]   that you know what the gaps are like,
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.260]   acknowledges that you have been living in those gaps,
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.740]   that you don't have all the answers,
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.460]   that there is sin and brokenness in your life.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.380]   And that prayer is a simple acknowledgement
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.980]   that there is one who is perfect,
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.620]   one who is full of love,
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.140]   one who can save you from that brokenness within.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.700]   And so if that's you,
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.540]   I'm just gonna invite you now
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.540]   as all of our eyes are closed,
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.180]   I'm just gonna invite you to pray.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.380]   And in fact, we're all gonna pray together,
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.940]   but if this is you,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.220]   this is you praying this for the first time,
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.420]   this is your way of saying,
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.140]   I wanna this to build and create
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.460]   and have this relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.380]   And if you pray this prayer for the first time,
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.020]   I want you to either share with the person
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.620]   who invited you afterwards,
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.980]   or you can come forward and share with our team
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.020]   or share with somebody outside afterwards.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.220]   There's lots of people here
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.060]   that would love to help you in this journey
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.620]   that you're about to step into.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.940]   And so as a church community,
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.740]   and if this is for you for the first time,
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.020]   all of us are gonna pray this out loud,
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.580]   but this is for you too.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.220]   Let's just pray this, Lord Jesus,
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:04.340]   I wanna thank you for dying for me,
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.660]   for going to the cross,
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.300]   to pay the price for my sin.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.740]   I recognize that I have done some things
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.620]   that have hurt you,
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.100]   that have hurt me,
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.820]   that have hurt others.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:24.220]   And I ask in this moment that you would forgive me.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.740]   And I invite you to now come into my life.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:33.300]   I invite you to forgive me.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.660]   I accept your grace.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.980]   And I ask that your Holy Spirit,
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.020]   your love and your joy and your peace
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.380]   would be in me now,
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.980]   now and forever.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.020]   And I thank you for this,
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.740]   in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:57.940]   All right, we can open our eyes.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.140]   Why don't we give a round of applause for anyone here,
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.820]   whether online, in this room.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.540]   May that prayer for the first time,
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.020]   we're so excited for you.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.780]   Please do share with the person you came with
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.980]   or share with us afterwards.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.620]   We'd love to help you in your walk.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.140]   For the rest of us, well, for all of us,
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.180]   why don't we stand together?
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.380]   And we're going to just respond together
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.220]   in one more time of worship.
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.800]   (gentle music)
