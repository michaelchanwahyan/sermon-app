1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
 Amen.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,720
 Thank you, worship team.

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,700
 That was beautiful.

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,400
 Let's go.

5
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,920
 Wow, okay.

6
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,600
 You can say hello to the person next to you.

7
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,380
 You know, it might be someone new.

8
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,920
 If you're online, hi.

9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,000
 Good to see you as well.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,120
 If you have some space next to you, let our host know.

11
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,200
 So if there's people outside who still need to come in,

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,640
 there might be a few seats scattered around.

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,800
 So host, if you see any hands being held up,

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,240
 out overflow people, welcome as well.

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,960
 If you still wanna come in, there might be a few seats.

16
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
 Excuse me, dotted around here and there.

17
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,900
 And so, yeah, welcome.

18
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,920
 All right, well, it's always an honor to be here

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,240
 sharing God's word with my church family.

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,640
 And today we come to the end

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,560
 of our Uncharted sermon series.

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,420
 You know, it's funny to think,

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,400
 who would have thought that God would work through

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,280
 a broken phone that Andrew had, right,

25
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,940
 to the journey that we've had in these past few weeks,

26
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,560
 walking through the season of being called

27
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,980
 into the Uncharted.

28
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,760
 Let me just give you a quick reminder

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,040
 of the different things that we've talked about

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,600
 in this journey so far.

31
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,640
 We started off by being encouraged in obedience to God.

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,920
 If there's one word, maybe,

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,980
 that summarizes everything so far,

34
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,240
 I think obedience might be quite a good one.

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,560
 But we're reminded at the start of this journey

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,240
 that there will be no map, right?

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,160
 There's no strategy, there's no map.

38
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,120
 We're going into areas and places and doing things

39
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,300
 that we've never done before.

40
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,100
 So of course there can't be a plan for it,

41
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,260
 but we are in response, in obedience

42
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,200
 to what God has called us to do.

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,100
 Even if it's not comfortable,

44
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,840
 we were challenged to go and to obey.

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,600
 And then we talked about shifting our perspective

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,880
 to the way we think, right,

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,740
 to put on God's perspective,

48
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,860
 to think about things from a kingdom,

49
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,160
 of a heavenly perspective,

50
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,460
 instead of using our earthly human wisdom

51
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,800
 to judge why we do things.

52
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,980
 As we go on this journey,

53
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,740
 we're also reminded of the likelihood

54
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,820
 of facing persecution,

55
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,380
 and the very real persecution

56
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,080
 that some of our brothers and sisters

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,340
 in different places of the world are facing today.

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,420
 And the challenge there was,

59
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,100
 when we do face persecution,

60
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,520
 not to shrink back, not to shy away,

61
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,420
 maybe not even to pray for God to help you escape from it,

62
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,940
 but to stay faithful and allow God to work through you,

63
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,760
 even in times of persecution.

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,100
 And then we were also told, and similarly, right,

65
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,500
 that sometimes God will indeed call us

66
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,540
 into those really hard places,

67
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,820
 call us to do things that don't make sense

68
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,220
 from the worldly perspective,

69
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,280
 put us in difficult positions

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,580
 where we have to respond in faith and in obedience.

71
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,100
 But God works through those things

72
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,940
 and uses us in those ways

73
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,640
 to show his power and his glory and his wisdom.

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,740
 Lastly, we talked about that

75
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,080
 God also works through the consistent faithfulness

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,100
 of his people.

77
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,820
 And it's not always going to be a big,

78
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,980
 amazing fireworks display of God's power at work,

79
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,260
 but often it's through the quiet,

80
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,060
 consistent faithfulness of his people.

81
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,420
 Again, just being obedient,

82
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,500
 being doing what God has called them to do,

83
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,280
 welcoming those God has called them to welcome,

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,820
 that his love and his power is at work.

85
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,700
 And today, as we close out the series,

86
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,740
 the theme we are talking about,

87
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,260
 the theme we're exploring is evangelism.

88
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,340
 Because yes, as we head into the uncharted,

89
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,700
 we might be doing all those things.

90
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,700
 We don't know where we're going,

91
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,300
 we don't have a plan of action,

92
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,580
 it's gonna be difficult.

93
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,020
 But the one thing we do know is who we're doing it for.

94
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,620
 This isn't a call to adventure

95
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,080
 like we were like Galilee or somewhere like that,

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,620
 going off into the uncharted,

97
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,060
 not knowing where we're gonna end up

98
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,380
 for our own purposes, right?

99
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,360
 That's not what this is about.

100
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,060
 Going into the uncharted has always been about

101
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,060
 going in the name of Jesus.

102
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,760
 We're not going for the sake of adventure,

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,640
 for our own name and our own fame.

104
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,620
 We're going to make known who Jesus is, right?

105
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,940
 To declare the gospel where it still needs to be heard,

106
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,680
 to teach and to make disciples,

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,340
 to testify near and far about who Jesus is.

108
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,700
 This is our mission.

109
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,840
 This has always been the mission of the church,

110
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,000
 of the people of God.

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,260
 Right, why else, right?

112
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,200
 Two things that Jesus said

113
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,800
 before he ascended into heaven, after his resurrection.

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,600
 Two main things he said was this.

115
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,240
 Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations,

116
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,120
 baptizing them in the name of the Father,

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,640
 of the Son and the Holy Spirit,

118
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,920
 and teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you,

119
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,380
 and surely I'm with you always to the very end of the age.

120
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,020
 Matthew 28, 19.

121
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,460
 Another version of this.

122
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,780
 In Acts 1, 8, it says this.

123
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,820
 But you will receive, what, power

124
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,540
 when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,

125
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,980
 and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem

126
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,380
 and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.

127
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,620
 So the scriptures are clear.

128
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,480
 For those of us who believe in Jesus,

129
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,660
 we have been told, we have been instructed,

130
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,100
 mandated, commanded even,

131
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,100
 to go and tell and teach and preach about Jesus.

132
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,340
 This is what I mean when we say evangelism.

133
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,580
 And this is something that every single Christian

134
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,460
 is called to be a part of.

135
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,300
 Now, but if we're honest, evangelism is one of those things

136
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,700
 that is sort of difficult and awkward to do, right?

137
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,980
 Let me tell you about one particular attempt of mine

138
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,540
 to evangelize, and you might be able to relate, all right?

139
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,540
 So I love talking to taxi drivers,

140
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,700
 and you might think that's kind of weird, right?

141
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,500
 I love talking to taxi drivers, Uber drivers, whatever it is.

142
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,700
 I just love talking in general, I guess, right?

143
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,180
 But taxi drivers are amazing, right?

144
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,060
 I know in some countries you can call an Uber

145
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,860
 and you can request, right, like, don't chat to me, right?

146
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,820
 You're missing out, okay, if you don't talk to your driver.

147
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,260
 I think taxi drivers are the quintessential Hong Kong uncles,

148
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,860
 right, especially the ones in their 60s, okay, yeah.

149
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,460
 [audience laughing]

150
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,220
 That is, yeah, okay.

151
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,060
 Right, you know, but they're like

152
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,380
 the quintessential Hong Kong man, okay?

153
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,340
 You get in the taxi, it smells like newspapers

154
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,660
 and cigarettes, right?

155
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,420
 Every single sentence that comes out of their mouth

156
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,020
 has to have a curse word, right?

157
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
 It doesn't matter what they're talking about,

158
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,060
 and it's not even swearing to them, right?

159
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,060
 It's just the way they talk, right?

160
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,140
 It's just, you know, the way they express themselves.

161
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,380
 And they'll talk about anything, right?

162
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,100
 They love talking about how, you know,

163
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,540
 [speaking in foreign language]

164
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,540
 You know, all this kind of stuff,

165
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,420
 like Hong Kong wasn't like it used to be.

166
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,740
 You know, you young people, you're so blessed,

167
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,420
 or you don't know what you're doing,

168
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,100
 all these kind of life advice, you know,

169
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,860
 this is how you raise your children.

170
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,740
 You know, they love to talk about politics

171
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,780
 and where you sit and the whole spectrum of politics.

172
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,340
 Anything they love to talk about, even religion.

173
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,340
 So for me, sometimes when I get into a taxi,

174
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,940
 I see it as the perfect time to evangelize,

175
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,540
 because you have a captive audience, right?

176
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,420
 Like, you're not going anywhere, he's not going anywhere,

177
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,580
 okay, and you have to pay them in the end.

178
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,500
 They're waiting for your money, and so, you know,

179
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,220
 what else are you gonna do with that conversation?

180
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,420
 And so one time I was with, this is quite a few years ago,

181
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,460
 I was with, I used to have lots of missionary friends

182
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,580
 that would come over to Hong Kong and do missionary work.

183
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,700
 So this guy was even more zealous, like so on fire

184
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,820
 for telling people about Jesus.

185
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,180
 Big, you know, Southern American guy,

186
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,380
 he's probably about like six foot five, you know.

187
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,180
 Imagine, I'm not sure if you're gonna get this reference,

188
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,180
 but Stone Cold Steve Austin, okay,

189
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,380
 he's like a big wrestler dude,

190
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,460
 looks like he could be a biker gang,

191
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,700
 like full of tattoos, right?

192
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,140
 In another life, he might have been like a gang leader

193
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,100
 or a wrestler or something, and not that wrestling's bad,

194
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,860
 okay, but like something like that, like a bad person, okay?

195
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,740
 But this guy loved Jesus

196
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,660
 and loved telling other people about Jesus.

197
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,620
 And so we got into the taxi and he was like,

198
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,700
 okay, let's talk to Jesus about this,

199
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,420
 to Jesus about this, okay, yeah, okay, let's do it.

200
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,060
 And so, but he said, okay, translate for me.

201
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,580
 So okay, I'll be a translator,

202
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,820
 and he went with a classic question.

203
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,660
 He said, okay, tell him this, if you die today,

204
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,940
 where do you think you'd end up?

205
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,780
 I was like, oh.

206
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,380
 That's such a wild place to start a conversation, right?

207
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,500
 Like, I was like, are you sure, man?

208
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,340
 He said, okay.

209
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,500
 So I said to the taxi, okay,

210
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,700
 reluctantly a little bit, I said to the taxi driver,

211
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,700
 I said, (speaking in foreign language)

212
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,820
 I just translated for him.

213
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,980
 And so the way his face changed was like,

214
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,540
 like he thought he was about to be robbed

215
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,100
 'cause he said to me, he's like,

216
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,740
 true story, true story, okay.

217
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,740
 He said to me, (speaking in foreign language)

218
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,900
 He said, don't do anything stupid.

219
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,220
 Tell your friend not to do anything stupid.

220
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,380
 I just started, I have no money, okay.

221
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,140
 So I had to explain, no, we're not,

222
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,940
 this isn't what this is about, okay, calm down, okay.

223
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,380
 We're here to give you life, actually, right, so.

224
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,860
 But how about you, okay?

225
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,700
 In your attempt to evangelize,

226
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,540
 maybe it's something you've tried before,

227
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,460
 maybe it's something you've never tried this before

228
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,140
 precisely because your fear of getting yourselves

229
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,980
 in those sort of situations where it's awkward, it's weird.

230
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,180
 You might get scared, you might get nervous,

231
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,020
 you're not sure how the other person's gonna respond.

232
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,220
 And we live with this underlying guilt sometimes, right.

233
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,900
 We know this is something we're supposed to do,

234
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,180
 but we don't do it.

235
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,160
 But evangelism is something that we are meant to do,

236
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,060
 like we're saying.

237
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,220
 But I often feel like we're not doing a good enough job.

238
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,100
 But today I hope we're gonna be encouraged in this, okay.

239
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,580
 Because evangelism is something, like I said,

240
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,820
 for every single person who claims to be a Christian

241
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,100
 to take part in, to actively do in their lives.

242
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,420
 We're gonna look through the book of Acts

243
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,980
 and see what the passage has to say about evangelism.

244
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,220
 So as the book of Acts begins, right,

245
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,760
 we see that the disciples,

246
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,040
 the world has just been turned upside down, right.

247
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,820
 They've seen their best friend, their mentor,

248
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,620
 their teacher, their savior, dying across.

249
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,020
 And then miraculously, through the power of God,

250
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,340
 he resurrects back to life.

251
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,060
 He spends about 40 days with them,

252
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,680
 walking, teaching, eating, hanging out again,

253
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,340
 before going back into heaven.

254
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,980
 And like I said, before going back into heaven,

255
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
 he leaves them with this gigantic task

256
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,280
 of telling the whole world about him.

257
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,580
 And then he just, poof, disappears into the sky,

258
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,880
 right, quite literally.

259
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,300
 Now at this point, they're probably wondering,

260
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,820
 and understandably, right, a little bit nervous as well,

261
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,220
 like how on earth are we supposed to do this?

262
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,060
 Or what's the plan, what's the strategy?

263
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,820
 And at this moment, they don't know.

264
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,900
 They don't really have one.

265
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,300
 So they go back to the one thing they do know what to do,

266
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,300
 and that is to gather together and to pray and to wait,

267
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,660
 just like Emma was encouraging us

268
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,240
 and Jethro was encouraging us to do just now.

269
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,020
 Acts 1:4 tells us this.

270
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,380
 They all, that is all the disciples,

271
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,600
 joined together constantly in prayer

272
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,320
 along with the woman and Mary,

273
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,100
 the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.

274
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,700
 So everybody who was following Jesus at the time,

275
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,500
 right, were gathered consistently,

276
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,120
 constantly in prayer together.

277
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,100
 And in our journey of evangelism,

278
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,020
 this passage reminded me of this, right,

279
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,140
 it has to start with prayer.

280
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,940
 Right, they had no idea what all was about to happen.

281
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,260
 Right, they didn't know how to complete this task

282
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,620
 that Jesus had given to them,

283
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,340
 to witness to the ends of the earth.

284
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,660
 But the one thing they did know that they could do

285
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,500
 whilst figuring all this out was to pray.

286
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,940
 You know, and often in evangelism,

287
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,340
 we immediately, right, we think of all these plans

288
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,380
 and tactics and strategies to win souls for Jesus, right?

289
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,660
 I've seen them all, and maybe you've seen them too.

290
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,460
 The Evanger Cube, any of you ever had an Avenger Cube?

291
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,540
 Right, there was this thing where you would manipulate,

292
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,740
 just like a Rubik's Cube, and you keep flipping it,

293
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,700
 and each picture tells a different version

294
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,100
 of the gospel story.

295
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,620
 Or maybe if you grew up in youth group,

296
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,860
 you made one of those bracelets,

297
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,180
 with like the red, some people are nodding, right,

298
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,060
 the red, the yellow, the black, the green,

299
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,260
 I can't remember the order,

300
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,300
 and each bead tells a different story about the gospel.

301
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,900
 Someone taught me this, it didn't work at all,

302
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
 but for many years as a teenager,

303
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,740
 I walked around with a,

304
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,980
 with tied to empty water bottle

305
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,060
 hanging off the back of my backpack, right?

306
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,260
 And the idea was that people would see,

307
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,100
 that's kind of weird,

308
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,580
 like why do you have a water bottle

309
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,180
 hanging off the back of your backpack?

310
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,900
 And then I would evangelize them, right?

311
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,020
 Like I'd be like, well you see this bottle's empty, right?

312
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,140
 Well let me tell you about living water

313
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,220
 that could fill this up, you know,

314
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,120
 it's like so cheesy, right, like it never worked, okay?

315
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,940
 So do these things kind of work?

316
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,220
 Okay, I mean, yes, sometimes, maybe not really,

317
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,340
 and I'm not saying there's no tactics

318
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,380
 and there's no ways to learn how to evangelize,

319
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,100
 we'll talk about that a little bit more.

320
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,020
 But the point is this, right?

321
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,540
 Before we go to tools and tactics

322
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,940
 and all this kind of stuff,

323
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,260
 we need to start with prayer.

324
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,660
 So my first question for us this morning is this,

325
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,700
 are we praying?

326
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,200
 Are we gathering and devoting ourselves to prayer

327
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,820
 as the disciples were?

328
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,260
 Whilst we wait on God,

329
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,780
 are we actively listening to what he wants to say to us?

330
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,660
 And the best way to do that is through prayer.

331
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,060
 We pray for ourselves, for our courage,

332
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,820
 we pray for opportunities to present the gospel,

333
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,140
 we pray for the wisdom to know what to say

334
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,420
 when the opportunity presents itself.

335
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,620
 This is a reminder for us,

336
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,260
 it's not just evangelism actually,

337
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,700
 anything we do, but especially with evangelism,

338
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,620
 has to start with prayer.

339
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,420
 And we see what happens.

340
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,020
 It's precisely during one of these prayer times

341
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,340
 that we're gathered together,

342
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,420
 praying together in one place,

343
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,620
 that suddenly one of the most spectacular things

344
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,580
 we see in all through scripture happens.

345
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,020
 It tells us this,

346
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,460
 when the day of Pentecost came,

347
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,580
 they were all together in one place,

348
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,100
 presumably praying.

349
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,500
 Suddenly, a sound like the blowing of a violent wind

350
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,180
 came from heaven and filled the whole house

351
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,080
 where they were sitting.

352
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,980
 So just imagine the scene, right?

353
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,100
 You're sitting there, you're gathered with your friends,

354
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,740
 brothers and sisters, you're praying,

355
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,660
 and suddenly this loud swooshing sound

356
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,700
 just moves through the room, unmistakable.

357
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,700
 Everybody hears it.

358
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,820
 Right, it's like when we've been sat in buildings

359
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,580
 or maybe in your classroom, maybe at home,

360
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,620
 and there's a typhoon eight blowing outside,

361
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,560
 you can hear the wind just blowing through your doors,

362
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,060
 the windows are rattling, the doors are shaking,

363
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,140
 it's unmistakable what's happening.

364
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,180
 There's a huge sound of this wind

365
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,780
 that blows through this room.

366
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,740
 But this wasn't a typhoon, right?

367
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,780
 It wasn't an ordinary wind.

368
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,420
 Did you catch what Luke tells us?

369
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,620
 Okay, check it out, listen to this again.

370
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,300
 This was a wind that came from where?

371
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,180
 A blowing, a violent wind that came from heaven.

372
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,220
 Right, this was God at work.

373
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,180
 Just like when the Israelites were about to cross the Red Sea

374
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,060
 and the Lord drove the sea back to reveal dry land,

375
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,260
 what did he use?

376
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,200
 A strong east wind to guide his people into freedom.

377
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,120
 And what I think God's trying to say here is this,

378
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
 that through the wind of the Holy Spirit now,

379
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,080
 I'm gonna drive back your fears,

380
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,480
 I'm gonna drive back your worries,

381
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
 I'm gonna open up a new way

382
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,680
 for you to lead people into freedom.

383
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,640
 The Holy Spirit is here and everything is about to change.

384
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,860
 Now the wind, of course, was just part one.

385
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,760
 Because watch this, right?

386
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,800
 Then pay attention to what God does next.

387
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,360
 And then they saw what seemed to be tongues of fire

388
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,360
 that separated and came to rest on each of them.

389
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,160
 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit

390
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,360
 and they began to speak in other tongues

391
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,560
 as the Spirit enabled them.

392
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,000
 And when we get to passages like this,

393
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,600
 I know, you know, maybe my imagination goes to,

394
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,920
 what does this actually look like?

395
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,960
 Like tongues of fire, was it like little candle wicks,

396
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,640
 flames like sitting on people's heads, right?

397
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,680
 That's the kind of image I get in my head.

398
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,760
 But again, it's a representation of God's presence.

399
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,760
 Think back in scripture when fire shows up,

400
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,360
 especially in the Exodus story,

401
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,840
 Moses and the burning bush, right?

402
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,360
 The way that God used fire to guide the Israelites

403
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,580
 by a pillar of fire through the night

404
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,800
 when they were in the wilderness,

405
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,560
 giving them warmth and light

406
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,120
 as they were going through into the promised land.

407
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,440
 When they reached Sinai, it says,

408
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,440
 God descended on the mountain in a great fire.

409
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,440
 Again, it's a confirmation of God's presence.

410
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
 And it sounds weird, it sounds undescribable

411
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,520
 because it precisely is undescribable, right?

412
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,040
 This is human words trying to describe

413
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,000
 a supernatural occurrence.

414
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,520
 But the point is, it's undoubtedly the presence of God

415
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,520
 showing up in a very clear and obvious way, wind and fire.

416
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,280
 If our first step of evangelism is prayer,

417
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,440
 the second step is we have to be empowered

418
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,720
 by the Holy Spirit.

419
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,560
 Wind and fire coming together, sweeping through the place.

420
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,680
 Have you ever been filled with the Holy Spirit?

421
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,440
 If you received Jesus as your Savior,

422
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,960
 you have to be filled with the Spirit,

423
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,960
 to be filled with his presence.

424
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,160
 Have you experienced the presence of God?

425
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,760
 You know it's just resting on you like a consuming fire,

426
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,680
 burning away everything else, burning away anything

427
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,040
 that's not of him.

428
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,920
 The wind of the Holy Spirit filling you up afresh

429
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,600
 and anew, just like what we're singing about just now.

430
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,080
 We see that when we've been soaked in prayer,

431
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
 empowered by the Holy Spirit,

432
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,320
 there's about to be a movement that happens

433
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,680
 that will not be stopped, that has not stopped

434
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,240
 until this very day.

435
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,040
 The powerful forces, untamable forces of wind and fire

436
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,440
 working together, sweeping through the disciples' lives,

437
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,600
 causing them to stop this unstoppable task

438
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,040
 of evangelizing the world in the name of Jesus.

439
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,960
 Look what happens next.

440
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
 They were staying there in Jerusalem,

441
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,160
 God-fearing Jews from every nation under,

442
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,280
 now they're staying there in Jerusalem,

443
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,080
 God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.

444
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,480
 So this is the people from all over the world

445
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,960
 gathered together at Jerusalem because it was Pentecost,

446
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,560
 the Jewish festival of Pentecost.

447
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,760
 And when they heard this sound,

448
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,920
 this sound that the disciples heard just now,

449
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,880
 a crowd came together in bewilderment

450
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,560
 because each one heard their own language being spoken.

451
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,360
 Utterly amazed, they asked,

452
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,840
 aren't all these who are speaking Galileans?

453
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,800
 Then how is it that each of us hears

454
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,880
 in our own native language?

455
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,480
 Parthians, Medes, Elamites,

456
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,360
 forgive my mispronunciations here,

457
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,240
 Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus,

458
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,480
 Asia, Pharisia, Pamphylia, Egypt,

459
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,680
 the parts of Libya, Cyrene, visitors from all over Rome,

460
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,200
 Cretans and Arabs, we hear them declaring, what?

461
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,880
 The wonders of God in our own tongues.

462
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,960
 So I know sometimes it's a bit of controversy here

463
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,840
 as to what tongues is actually describing, right?

464
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,200
 Is it the ability to suddenly speak different languages

465
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
 or was it the charismatic, unintelligible,

466
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 supernatural prayer language of tongues?

467
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,720
 The crowd reaction suggests that they were hearing

468
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,380
 their own languages being spoken, right?

469
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,040
 So this is a supernatural miracle that's happening on.

470
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,320
 People that don't know how to speak a language

471
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,200
 suddenly receive the ability to speak that language.

472
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,040
 But that's not the main point.

473
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,400
 What I wanna focus on is this,

474
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,640
 that what the disciples were saying, okay?

475
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,160
 It says they were what?

476
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,600
 Declaring the wonders of God.

477
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,240
 Speaking out the wonders of God,

478
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,600
 telling the things that they have seen God do.

479
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,900
 Now this is amazing to me, right?

480
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,340
 Think about it.

481
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,260
 The very first thing that happens to prove

482
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,540
 that God's spirit is alive,

483
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,820
 the very first thing that Jesus does through his disciples

484
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,940
 after his life, death and resurrection ascension to heaven,

485
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,140
 was not to perform miracles in a very real way, right?

486
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,380
 Was not to go and heal the sick,

487
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,740
 was not going to feed the poor, right?

488
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,860
 It's not that they started a church.

489
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,080
 The very first sign of the disciples

490
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,600
 being filled with the Holy Spirit

491
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,180
 was that they were compelled to declare the wonders of God.

492
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,560
 Or in other words, they began to evangelize.

493
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,060
 They began to spread the gospel.

494
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:48,440
 Now do you see how important evangelism is to Jesus' heart?

495
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,240
 And as this happens, right?

496
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,340
 As this amazing thing happens, right?

497
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,620
 There were a few different reactions.

498
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,200
 Some people had the reaction of this, right?

499
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,920
 Amazed and perplexed.

500
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,760
 They asked one another, scripture tells us,

501
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,400
 "What does this mean?"

502
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,680
 In other words, there was a big group of people

503
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,440
 that were curious.

504
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
 Like, "What's going on?

505
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,920
 "We heard this sound, this wind,

506
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,280
 "and now these people are speaking to us in languages

507
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,040
 "that they should not be able to speak."

508
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,500
 They came to find out more.

509
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,840
 And you will find as you go on your journey of evangelizing,

510
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,900
 of telling people about the gospel,

511
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,600
 when the gospel is proclaimed,

512
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,680
 it does often pique curiosity.

513
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,120
 I think back when Jesus was teaching,

514
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,280
 huge crowds would gather, right?

515
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,560
 They would gather to come and listen to his parables,

516
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,760
 to his teaching, and they would be left thinking,

517
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,680
 "Who is this guy?

518
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,360
 "He teaches with such authority.

519
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,280
 "What do these parables mean?

520
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,700
 "This person is different, the way he speaks,

521
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,660
 "this message is like nothing I've ever heard.

522
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,640
 "We can't stop listening to it."

523
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,080
 However, at the same time, the scriptures also told us

524
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,000
 that some people made fun of them and said,

525
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,920
 "They've had too much wine."

526
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,160
 Now, I'm not sure if you've ever talked to someone

527
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,280
 who's had too much wine,

528
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,240
 probably not because we're good Christian people here.

529
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,880
 We've never been around people like that,

530
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,600
 but I've heard that when people have too much wine,

531
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,560
 they start talking in ways that don't make sense.

532
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,200
 And this is also gonna happen when you start to evangelize.

533
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,080
 There's gonna be people who laugh at us and sneer at us,

534
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,480
 and some people who will say things like,

535
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,080
 "This doesn't make sense.

536
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,820
 "You sound like a drunk person talking here, right?

537
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,960
 "This is just the blabbering of a drunken person."

538
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,360
 Maybe you've heard some of this before,

539
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,120
 as you've had some of these responses before, right?

540
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,640
 You believe in this nonsense?

541
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,000
 You really think a virgin could give birth to a baby?

542
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,760
 That's rubbish.

543
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,680
 You really think someone who was dead can be resurrected?

544
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,220
 You really believe out of all the powers out there

545
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,960
 that there's only one God?

546
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,760
 You really think that sex is something for marriage?

547
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,480
 You know, it's not just for relationships?

548
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,640
 You believe in this Bible that was written 2,000 years ago?

549
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,320
 Doesn't it contradict itself?

550
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,600
 It makes no sense?

551
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
 You believe in all that stuff?

552
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,480
 And yes, the accusation will be that the Christian message

553
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,060
 sounds like the ridiculous rants of a drunk.

554
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,140
 The first point of evangelism is we need to start with prayer

555
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,620
 and the second thing is we need to go with the power

556
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,060
 of the Holy Spirit.

557
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,900
 The third thing that we've been saying

558
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,380
 is that we need to expect opposition.

559
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,000
 But look at how it happens.

560
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,660
 What will our reaction be is the question.

561
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,620
 'Cause when Peter faces all these accusations, right?

562
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,100
 Now, he could have done a few things.

563
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,180
 He could have toned it down to,

564
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,220
 "Actually, you know what, yeah, it's a bit much.

565
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,020
 "Okay, come on, guys, let's come and gather back,

566
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,260
 "let's keep praying and let's not cause too much trouble."

567
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,520
 And maybe that's what we wanna do as well.

568
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,540
 "Okay, yeah, I'll just shut up about it

569
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,060
 "and I'm not gonna talk about it anymore."

570
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,380
 Or maybe we change the message to make it a bit more

571
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,900
 acceptable, a bit more palatable to the people

572
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,060
 that we're talking to.

573
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,420
 But that's not the kind of people we wanna be, right?

574
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,860
 That waters down the truth.

575
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,140
 That's not the type of church we've called to be.

576
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,380
 Right, do we really wanna be the kind of Christians

577
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,340
 that just fold under a little bit of ridicule,

578
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,580
 who are afraid to speak the whole truth?

579
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,500
 No, church.

580
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,620
 We wanna be the kind of followers of Jesus

581
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,300
 who are bold in the faith,

582
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,980
 willing to stand up to persecution and ridicule,

583
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,500
 as we were saying about in this past journey.

584
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,700
 And this is what we see in Peter.

585
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,660
 Right, Peter isn't scared, he isn't intimidated,

586
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,100
 but he stands up and raises his voice, it says,

587
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,300
 and begins to preach the gospel.

588
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,380
 Right, he begins to explain who Jesus was.

589
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,340
 What's happening actually does make sense.

590
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,660
 This is what's happening.

591
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,020
 And he begins to talk about Jesus,

592
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,900
 that he was the one that was sent from God

593
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,480
 through his signs and miracles that Jesus performed

594
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,180
 that proved this, that he was put to death on the cross.

595
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,580
 But then listen, let's go back to scripture.

596
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,460
 But God raised him from the dead,

597
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,380
 freeing him from the agony of death,

598
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,500
 because it was impossible for death to keep a hold on him.

599
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,260
 And now God has raised this Jesus to life,

600
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,900
 and we were all witnesses of it.

601
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,420
 Exalted to the right hand of God,

602
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,020
 he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit

603
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,460
 and has poured out what you now see and hear,

604
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,020
 that Jesus is both Lord and Messiah over all people,

605
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,860
 and everyone who calls on the name of the Lord

606
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,580
 will be saved.

607
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,160
 He doesn't hold back.

608
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,620
 He boldly declares what is happening,

609
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,140
 who Jesus is, what he was, that he came to this earth to do,

610
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,560
 and you, Christian, have been called to do the same.

611
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,820
 If you're sitting here right now listening to this story,

612
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,660
 if you call yourself a follower of Jesus,

613
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,020
 the gospel is something that you've already received,

614
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,940
 you've already experienced.

615
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,900
 You know this story because you're living in it right now.

616
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,860
 But since we're talking about it, the gospel,

617
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,900
 just in case there's someone here right now listening

618
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,020
 who hasn't heard the gospel, maybe you're listening online,

619
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,940
 maybe a friend brought you to church today,

620
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,220
 and maybe for all the rest of us, it's just a reminder.

621
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,900
 What is this story?

622
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,980
 What is this amazing thing that we're talking about?

623
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,580
 Well, the gospel starts with recognizing

624
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,540
 that there is one God.

625
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,540
 This is the God who created the heavens and the earth,

626
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,580
 who sung every star and planet in the sky,

627
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,680
 yet he knows you by name.

628
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,200
 Because he created you.

629
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,200
 He created us, human beings, in love, in his image.

630
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,800
 And the Bible tells us he breathed his life into our lungs.

631
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,360
 And when he created this earth, everything was perfect,

632
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,800
 because our God is perfect.

633
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,360
 But we messed it up.

634
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,320
 We rebelled against God, we sinned against him,

635
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,760
 and into his perfect creation, we brought sin.

636
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,280
 And sin is this horrible mess that just keeps getting worse.

637
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,280
 The more we try to clean it up ourselves,

638
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,000
 the more we try to fix it, the worse it becomes.

639
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,200
 And sin is what binds us in darkness.

640
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,360
 Sin is what makes us commit and think evil thoughts.

641
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,320
 Sin is what brings death.

642
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,880
 Sin is what has now separated us

643
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
 from this God who created us.

644
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,560
 But yet, he loved us.

645
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,680
 And he loved us so much,

646
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,560
 he refused to let us sit in sin and darkness.

647
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,880
 And so he begins this rescue plan to try to save us.

648
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,880
 And in this rescue plan, he sends his beloved son, Jesus.

649
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,260
 And Jesus comes down to earth to live amongst us.

650
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,620
 And Jesus is God, we know this,

651
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,160
 because whilst he was on this earth, as Peter was saying,

652
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,420
 he proved it time and time again

653
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,640
 in the way he taught with authority,

654
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,320
 in the way he loved people,

655
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,160
 in the signs and wonders that he performed.

656
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,680
 He proved it in fulfilling the many prophecies

657
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,280
 that the Old Testament proclaimed.

658
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,400
 And ultimately, he proved it to us

659
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,400
 by dying on the cross for our sins, paying that price.

660
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,120
 Not because we did anything to earn it,

661
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,040
 not because we did enough good things

662
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,720
 to capture his attention,

663
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,040
 not because we fixed ourselves up first.

664
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,960
 This was not our idea or our doing.

665
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,360
 This is because of the love that he had for us.

666
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,160
 But even death could not hold Jesus down.

667
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,960
 And after three days in the tomb,

668
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,920
 God raised Jesus back to life,

669
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,960
 defeating the powers of sin and darkness once and for all,

670
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,760
 establishing his rightful place as king

671
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,800
 over the entire universe, reconciling us with God,

672
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,200
 confirming that Jesus is indeed the Messiah and Savior

673
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,480
 the world is longing for.

674
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,920
 And to this day, if you call on the name of Jesus

675
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,520
 and Jesus alone, if you accept him as your Savior,

676
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,400
 you too will be saved.

677
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,760
 Right, this is the greatest story in history,

678
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,000
 the greatest story that's ever been told.

679
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,640
 This is why the meaning of what gospel is, right?

680
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,080
 This is why it's called the good news.

681
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,600
 And like I said, if you and I listening to this right now,

682
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,960
 for those of us who've already lived it,

683
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,880
 you've accept this, you believe this, right?

684
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
 You felt the love of God.

685
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,120
 You felt the Holy Spirit working inside of you.

686
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,480
 You are aware of how he saved you from your sin.

687
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,040
 You're living in this new life now,

688
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,960
 reconciled with God, being able to gather

689
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,280
 with brothers and sisters like this, right?

690
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,040
 Would you disagree with me that this is the best news

691
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,200
 that you've ever heard, that you've ever received,

692
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,480
 the best thing ever?

693
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,000
 Nobody disagrees with you in that, right?

694
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,920
 Then brothers and sisters, if this is the case,

695
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,560
 why are we not telling everybody about this?

696
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,200
 Why are we not sharing it?

697
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,320
 I mean, it's not like, and I'm talking to myself here too,

698
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,040
 okay, it's not like we don't like to share news, right?

699
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,680
 Anything, social media proves to us,

700
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,880
 we love to share about things that happen to us, right?

701
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,560
 Coldplay, woohoo, yeah, she said yes, yeah.

702
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,480
 New cookies and one try, okay?

703
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,160
 All these things we love to share about, right?

704
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,400
 We will share about everything else.

705
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,000
 So why is it then when it comes to sharing the gospel,

706
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,200
 which we've already agreed is the greatest story

707
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,000
 that's ever told, but it's also a story

708
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,360
 that's hardly ever told?

709
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,760
 Again, in my own reflection and in my own heart,

710
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,320
 there's a few reasons why I sometimes think

711
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,000
 we are reluctant and we keep quiet about the gospel.

712
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,480
 First thing is this, fear.

713
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,200
 Maybe this is the biggest one, right?

714
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,400
 Questions such as, like I said just now,

715
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,840
 what are people gonna think about me?

716
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,480
 What if they mock me?

717
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,920
 I'm too religious, right?

718
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,880
 You're a goody two shoes, right?

719
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,000
 What if, I know my boss is sort of hostile

720
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,080
 towards Christianity, if I speak this out,

721
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,080
 I might not get the opportunities

722
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,480
 that my other colleagues might get.

723
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,280
 But what if they discriminate against me?

724
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,800
 What if I start facing persecution?

725
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
 Or maybe what if they start asking me questions

726
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,120
 and I don't know what I'm talking about

727
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,040
 and I look like a fool?

728
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,880
 Fear holds us, or these things,

729
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,760
 holds us back so often when it comes

730
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,040
 to sharing the gospel.

731
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,120
 Or maybe sometimes it's your own laziness,

732
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,640
 apathy, excuses, right?

733
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,280
 And the truth is this, again,

734
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,680
 I'm talking to myself here as well,

735
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,280
 so please don't, we're in this together, okay?

736
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,560
 Sometimes I feel like we don't care enough.

737
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,120
 And we give ourselves excuses like,

738
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,020
 oh, I'm not that good with words.

739
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,440
 It's not my gifting.

740
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,640
 If I don't say it, someone else will share with them.

741
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,160
 I don't have the time to do that right now.

742
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,560
 All these things, I'm just gonna wait

743
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,560
 for a better opportunity.

744
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,960
 And we get lazy and we prioritize other things

745
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,440
 over sharing the gospel.

746
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,280
 And perhaps sometimes it's forgetfulness.

747
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,680
 And we forget that we too were once in that place

748
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,320
 when we were without hope,

749
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,720
 where we were sitting in our sin,

750
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,880
 wondering what to do with ourselves.

751
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,840
 And we forget that if it wasn't for someone else

752
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,600
 who come and spoke and preached

753
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,760
 and taught us about the gospel,

754
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,040
 no matter who it could have been,

755
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,840
 could have been a grandmother, a parent,

756
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,600
 a teacher, a friend, whoever it was,

757
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,120
 that we would have never heard the gospel

758
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,280
 in the first place, and maybe we wouldn't be living

759
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,960
 the lives in Jesus, experiencing the love

760
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,080
 that we do in this moment.

761
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,760
 And our minds aren't tuned to those

762
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,200
 who are still lost in the darkness.

763
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,440
 We forget about that.

764
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,080
 And if we're honest with ourselves,

765
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,640
 it's probably a mixture of all these three things

766
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,960
 coming together.

767
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,160
 But what I'm challenging us today, church, is this, right?

768
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
 It's not good enough.

769
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,520
 And if we've been called to go into the uncharted

770
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,800
 like we have at the beginning of this journey,

771
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,440
 we have been commissioned and commanded

772
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,520
 into these unknown places, like I said,

773
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,200
 to proclaim the gospel and the name of Jesus.

774
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,720
 And Paul would say it this way, right?

775
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,840
 How can they call on the name of one

776
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,520
 they have not believed in?

777
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,280
 And how can they believe in one who they have not heard?

778
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,800
 And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?

779
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,160
 And how can anyone preach to them unless they are sent?

780
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,320
 Church, what I'm saying is this, we have all been sent.

781
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,240
 And whilst we're sitting here in this room,

782
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,080
 while people out there are living and dying

783
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,320
 without hearing and believing in Jesus,

784
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,240
 because we haven't done the work of evangelism

785
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,080
 and telling people about the gospel.

786
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,040
 Our sermon series might come to an end today,

787
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,880
 but the call remains on us, right?

788
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,800
 This is not a time to rest.

789
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,360
 This is not a time to hold back.

790
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,120
 This is a season that we've been talking about of action.

791
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,600
 It's not a time to tone down.

792
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,800
 God's desire is that the gospel, right, of his kingdom

793
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,520
 will be preached to the whole world.

794
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,640
 So we cannot stop talking about this

795
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,640
 until every single person has heard about Jesus.

796
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,760
 And it's not something we can be slow and lazy about,

797
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,280
 because a life without the gospel leads us

798
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,280
 to a very dark place with some very serious consequences.

799
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,240
 One of the consequences is this,

800
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,800
 eternal separation from God.

801
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,960
 The consequence of not hearing and responding to the gospel

802
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,600
 is that when we die, we end up separated from God forever.

803
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,800
 Again, we're just talking about real things here, okay?

804
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,440
 But our time on earth is gonna end in one of two ways, right?

805
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,440
 Either your body stops working, which means you die,

806
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,760
 or Jesus is gonna come back.

807
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,360
 Either way, we have very little control

808
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
 over those two occurrences.

809
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,620
 I mean, all of us in this room,

810
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,360
 and I pray that we do wanna live lives,

811
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,040
 good, healthy lives until we're gold and gray, right,

812
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
 and die peacefully in our sleep.

813
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,960
 But nobody is guaranteed that.

814
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,600
 And with my own eyes and my own life,

815
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,920
 and I'm sure you've experienced it too, right,

816
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,800
 life often, we call it cut short in some way.

817
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,000
 Sickness, disease, accidents, sometimes for reasons

818
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 when we don't even understand, life is out of our control.

819
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,460
 In the same way, Bible tells us no one knows

820
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,960
 the day or the hour when Jesus will return.

821
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,060
 We do know he is coming back, though,

822
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,600
 and when he does come back again for the second time

823
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,940
 to save those who are eagerly awaiting him,

824
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,260
 and we know that when he comes back,

825
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,540
 he's gonna be coming back as a king

826
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,940
 to judge the living and the dead.

827
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,060
 And we know when he comes back, or when we die,

828
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,420
 he's gonna separate those who have accepted

829
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,980
 and lived and praised and been walking in the gospel

830
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,420
 from those who have not.

831
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,260
 And those who have lived in the gospel,

832
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,980
 who have accepted Jesus as a savior,

833
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,940
 will go off and live with him eternal life with God,

834
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,540
 and for the others, it's eternal separation from God

835
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,880
 in darkness, in punishment.

836
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,000
 So that's a real consequence of responding to the gospel.

837
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,380
 But the second thing is this, I think this might be

838
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,600
 even more pressing and more important right now,

839
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,000
 because often we focus on that, we focus on the afterlife

840
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,080
 when we go to the evangelism group.

841
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,200
 Like when I said, if you die today, where you gonna go?

842
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,520
 But that's not the whole picture either.

843
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,160
 Because if it was, then accepting the gospel

844
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,160
 is sort of like the super life insurance that you could get.

845
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,600
 So the moment you die, you get to go to heaven.

846
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,240
 Okay, well then, again, let's just keep it real.

847
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,300
 If that's the case, then why not just die

848
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,840
 right after you receive the gospel?

849
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,640
 Then you get to go with me heaven straight away

850
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,000
 and everything will be fine.

851
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,800
 But when we live without the gospel,

852
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,280
 it's not just about the afterlife,

853
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,360
 but it's about life here right now.

854
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,740
 This is the beautiful thing about the gospel.

855
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,040
 It's not just about going to heaven

856
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,940
 and being with God forever.

857
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,320
 Like I said, it's not an afterlife insurance policy.

858
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,120
 But Jesus says this, I have come to give you life

859
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,920
 and life in the full.

860
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,000
 The gospel allows us to live our lives on this earth,

861
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,840
 however long or short that might be,

862
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,840
 with meaning and purpose and identity and mission

863
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,200
 that God intended us to have.

864
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,960
 So the gospel embodies every single part of our lives.

865
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,000
 The gospel is why we can have hope when things seem hopeless.

866
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,840
 The gospel is what drives us to speak up and fight back

867
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,320
 against the injustices we see in this world.

868
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,520
 The gospel is what compels us to love everybody

869
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,120
 that we see with the love of God, even our enemies.

870
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,040
 The gospel allows us to celebrate the joys of this life,

871
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
 but also walk with those who are going through

872
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,680
 the valley of the shadow of death.

873
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,160
 The gospel is because, it's the reason why

874
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,120
 we can come together in a room like this,

875
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,580
 people from all over the world,

876
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,100
 from all different backgrounds,

877
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,200
 together as a family worshiping Jesus.

878
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,160
 That is because of the gospel.

879
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,480
 This is why we cannot stay silent.

880
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,640
 Peter urges the people, "Save yourselves," he says,

881
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,520
 "from this corrupt generation."

882
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,660
 And this is what we still face to this day,

883
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,260
 a world that is corrupt, a world that is broken,

884
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,480
 a world with people living in darkness and without hope

885
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,720
 in this world or the next.

886
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,240
 But the gospel, church, this is the key.

887
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,080
 This is why I keep saying we cannot be silent,

888
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,040
 we cannot shut up, we cannot give up, we cannot stop.

889
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,680
 We need to preach the gospel because just two minutes,

890
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,720
 for a five-minute walk from here, right,

891
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,720
 under the bridge, there's people putting their hopes

892
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,960
 in the lady, slapping against a piece of paper, right?

893
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,120
 They're putting their hopes in that,

894
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,560
 engaging themselves in demonic forces.

895
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,400
 That's where they're finding their hope,

896
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,960
 trying to beat your troubles away.

897
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,040
 People need to see that that is not real hope.

898
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,140
 True hope is found in Jesus and Jesus alone.

899
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,120
 We need to preach the gospel because there are kids

900
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,720
 and teenagers and young people struggling right now

901
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,360
 in Hong Kong and all over the world

902
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,400
 to find meaning and purpose in life.

903
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,600
 And some have even turned to taking their own lives

904
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,240
 as a result.

905
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,800
 You know, our teen suicide rates in Hong Kong

906
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,960
 are some of the highest amongst developed nations.

907
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,120
 They need the gospel to know that no matter what happens,

908
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,560
 doesn't matter how good your grades are,

909
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,280
 doesn't matter what your teachers

910
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,560
 and your exam results tell you, right,

911
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,520
 that does not define you.

912
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,560
 But you have a Father in heaven who loves you

913
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,640
 and values you exactly for who you are,

914
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,060
 not what you are doing.

915
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,440
 We need to preach the gospel because there are couples

916
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,820
 struggling in their marriages, ready to give up,

917
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,480
 not seeing a hope in the future together.

918
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,140
 And the gospel is what teaches them about love

919
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:24,140
 and reconciliation and being the church to each other.

920
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,480
 We need to preach the gospel because some have sold

921
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,280
 themselves to the ways of the world,

922
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,840
 chasing money, status, fame, prestige, and all these things

923
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,040
 and reaching the mountaintops where they've literally

924
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,920
 acquired every single earthly thing that they want,

925
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,440
 still finding their lives empty,

926
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,400
 not knowing that the only thing that will ever satisfy them

927
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,940
 is Jesus.

928
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,560
 We need to preach the gospel because there are people

929
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,940
 and families just facing the everyday realities

930
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,760
 of what life is, right?

931
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,500
 The family that's facing financial issues,

932
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,940
 the child that just gets diagnosed with cancer,

933
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,820
 the father who's just lost his job and is told,

934
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,840
 there's no future for you in this company.

935
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,020
 Whatever it is, we go through the everyday

936
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,600
 harsh realities of life, not knowing that

937
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,240
 there's a God out there who can help them,

938
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,700
 who can lead them, who can guide them,

939
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,840
 who can heal, who can provide, who can save.

940
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,820
 For these reasons as More Church,

941
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,420
 we need to speak the gospel.

942
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,860
 You and me, my family in Christ,

943
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,840
 have been called to do this.

944
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:40,900
 And as we do this, remember, there is great power.

945
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,700
 You know, it's not, your job is just to speak it out,

946
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,620
 okay, to have the courage to do that.

947
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,480
 But it's not up to your own power.

948
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,480
 But when the gospel does work, it does amazing things,

949
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,540
 things we would never even imagine, right?

950
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,140
 Check out what it says, I'm continuing the passage in Acts.

951
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,100
 When the people heard this message,

952
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,540
 after they heard Peter speak,

953
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,940
 it told us they were cut to the heart.

954
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,340
 In other words, they had to make a decision.

955
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,780
 They even asked themselves the questions,

956
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,400
 brothers, what shall we do?

957
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,300
 We've heard this message, I've realized that

958
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,940
 now I also need this, right?

959
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,060
 This is God's work, this is God's,

960
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,080
 the power of God's word at work, right?

961
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,580
 Not your own power, but the gospel itself

962
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,760
 carries the message of Jesus.

963
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,880
 So all you have to do is speak it out

964
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,280
 and wait for the Lord to move.

965
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,100
 It's not about how convincing you are,

966
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,160
 but it's about how obedient you are

967
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,100
 in allowing God to speak through you.

968
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,600
 And it tells us that 3,000 people, amazing,

969
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,800
 were added to the number that day.

970
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,500
 Again, it's not about the numbers.

971
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,380
 It's about us being ready to respond,

972
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,220
 being ready to go and speak the gospel

973
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,100
 to those who need it.

974
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:04,200
 So like I said in the beginning,

975
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,460
 this might be uncharted and maybe now,

976
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,060
 you know, as we started, maybe you're feeling a bit guilty,

977
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,820
 maybe you've been feeling worse now, okay?

978
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,520
 And that's not the point, okay?

979
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,120
 The challenge is not to leave you feeling nervous

980
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,440
 and guilty because you've never done this before.

981
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,980
 It sounds so serious now, and I'm even more scared, okay?

982
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,060
 I want us to be encouraging each other

983
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,480
 to do this together, all right?

984
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,780
 Let's not let us get away with letting nervousness

985
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,580
 and fear stop us from what we're doing.

986
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,820
 So I'm gonna give you a few simple things

987
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,740
 that we can start with.

988
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,500
 Okay, these are things I truly believe, honestly,

989
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,180
 everybody can do, okay?

990
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,740
 All of us can do.

991
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,180
 First thing is this, okay?

992
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,940
 And again, I'm just gonna say it bluntly, right?

993
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,640
 Don't be a jerk, okay?

994
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,560
 Like, be a nice person.

995
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,540
 Be the kind of person that other people

996
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,060
 want to have conversations with, right?

997
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,640
 You can't be rude and mean in one minute

998
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,660
 and then suddenly say, oh, let me tell you about Jesus,

999
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,080
 right, no one's gonna want to listen to that, okay?

1000
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,360
 So just be kind, be nice, be loving, okay?

1001
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,320
 Be a bit patient.

1002
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,080
 I know we Hong Kongers are often very impatient

1003
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,040
 and rushing to place in there all the time.

1004
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,360
 Slow down, be kind, be loving, okay?

1005
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,800
 Second thing is this, right?

1006
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,540
 Use your testimony, right?

1007
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,160
 If you can't remember all the details of the Bible story,

1008
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,220
 maybe one thing you can do is study up on that,

1009
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,460
 read up on that, get yourself familiar with that.

1010
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,700
 But even without that, right, your testimony

1011
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,020
 is the gospel at work in your life, right?

1012
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,900
 So it is, in a way, preaching the gospel, right?

1013
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,580
 And you're never gonna be confused about your own story

1014
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,280
 because it's what happened to you, right?

1015
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,040
 Like I said, we all have been through the experience

1016
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,120
 of receiving the love of Jesus, right, changing our lives.

1017
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,240
 Just start with that, you know, invite that friend,

1018
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,960
 invite that person out for coffee and say, you know what?

1019
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,240
 I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about myself.

1020
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,600
 Let me tell you about my journey in Christianity, right?

1021
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,840
 This is what I was before, this is where I am now, right?

1022
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,640
 It's such a beautiful way to introduce Jesus to someone.

1023
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,900
 And third thing, like we said at the beginning,

1024
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,940
 is to pray, right?

1025
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,020
 Let's be praying for this church.

1026
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,060
 Let's be praying for each other, let's be praying

1027
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,460
 for other brothers and sisters all over the world

1028
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,860
 who are walking down this road and speak

1029
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,500
 and being encouraged to speak the gospel out.

1030
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,460
 Let's be in prayer for opportunities,

1031
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,980
 let's be in prayer for those who haven't heard

1032
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:35,980
 the gospel yet, and together, as a body of Christ,

1033
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,280
 we say we will not give up until all have heard

1034
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,820
 and received the love and the gospel of Jesus.

1035
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,420
 Would you pray with me?

1036
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:59,420
 You know, we were talking just now

1037
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,420
 and I made an assumption that it's,

1038
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,980
 you know, that everyone here has heard that message.

1039
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,780
 But I wanna give an opportunity right now

1040
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,180
 to perhaps this is the first time you've ever heard

1041
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,180
 that gospel story, the fact that there is a savior

1042
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,100
 and a messiah that loves you and wants to save you

1043
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,900
 from your sin and give you hope and life

1044
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,140
 and life to the full.

1045
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,900
 And maybe today is the first time

1046
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,940
 you've ever responded to that,

1047
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,420
 or want to respond to that.

1048
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,300
 And so with an opportunity like this,

1049
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,140
 I don't want it to go to waste.

1050
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:55,380
 I just wanna invite anyone who's there right now,

1051
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,140
 if that is you, two invitations for you.

1052
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,980
 Right now, maybe if you just, you can just sit there

1053
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,980
 and talk to God and just tell him, I want you, Jesus.

1054
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:12,740
 And it just starts with a very, very simple conversation

1055
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,780
 with God, you talk to him just like you would anyone else.

1056
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,340
 You can do that quietly and he hears you, he knows,

1057
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,440
 he sees everything.

1058
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,540
 But if you're willing, if you are, and if that's you,

1059
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:31,340
 I would also invite you to perhaps get up off your seat

1060
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,420
 and come forward right now so that the church

1061
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,260
 can pray for you.

1062
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,540
 Together we can celebrate this wonderful,

1063
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,740
 life-changing moment, eternity-changing moment right now.

1064
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,420
 I'm just gonna throw the invitation out there.

1065
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,460
 It doesn't matter if nobody comes forward.

1066
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,140
 If you're in the upper house listening,

1067
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,340
 you can come downstairs and come forward.

1068
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:56,000
 I'm just gonna give us a couple of seconds

1069
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,940
 to respond to that.

1070
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,020
 So if that is you, either just respond where you are,

1071
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,980
 that's okay, but the courageous thing to do,

1072
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,900
 and we would love to be able to celebrate with you

1073
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,580
 if you would come forward so we can pray for you

1074
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,900
 and celebrate this together.

1075
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,660
 Is anybody out there right now with that?

1076
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:21,660
 Or maybe online you can just let us know as well.

1077
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,240
 (gentle music)

1078
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:32,100
 All right, that's okay.

1079
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,260
 For the rest of us, we know what we need to do.

1080
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,380
 We've always known, and today's probably just a reminder

1081
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,500
 of the mission, the calling that God has given,

1082
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,020
 the task that he's given to all of us.

1083
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,620
 And so Jesus, we pray that you would just fill us up

1084
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,280
 with the Holy Spirit, with courage.

1085
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,820
 Bring us to the people that need to hear your gospel.

1086
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,500
 And just through one conversation at a time, Lord,

1087
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,460
 we bring your kingdom here on this earth.

1088
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,740
 We show people that there is a God who loves them

1089
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,700
 and offers them everything that they've ever wanted,

1090
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,180
 everything that they needed can be found

1091
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,540
 when we find Jesus, true meaning and purpose in life.

1092
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,380
 And everything else fades away

1093
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,560
 when we have you in the center.

1094
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,420
 So Lord, help us to carry and live

1095
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,300
 and preach this gospel with us wherever we go,

1096
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,380
 from here to the ends of the earth.

1097
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:38,140
 Strengthen us and send us.

1098
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,580
 We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

1099
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:50,580
