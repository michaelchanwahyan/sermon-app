[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.960]   - Amen.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.960]   Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.960]   Congratulations to all the baptism candidates.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.440]   What a wonderful day to celebrate together.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.920]   And so yeah, as Carla said, over the past five weeks,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.200]   we've been exploring, right, through the Old Testament,
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.720]   these encounters with God.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.520]   And through looking at the different characters
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.400]   and the encounters they have had,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.600]   the hope is that you've been challenged,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.560]   you've been inspired, and hopefully even changed
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.840]   as you start to apply some of these things
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.280]   that we've been talking about into your own life.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.360]   The whole heart behind this series was that,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.840]   you know, right at the beginning of the year,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.800]   I'm not sure if you remember,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.080]   the word spoken over us by the Lord was intimacy.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.880]   And these encounters prove that God is a God
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.600]   that wants to be close to us,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.960]   that wants us to be close to him,
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.360]   that wants to reveal things about himself to us
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.080]   so that we can get to know him.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.600]   However, and this is the other side of the coin,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.040]   being close to God, encountering him in all we do,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.360]   knowing and feeling the love of Jesus
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.840]   is not necessarily the end goal
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.600]   of what it means to call yourself a Christian.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.920]   And yes, over the summer, right,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.040]   we've had some incredible moments in this room.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.800]   Even this morning, today,
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.280]   there have been times where we've been worshiping
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.440]   when it feels like we're worshiping
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.240]   with the angels themselves in heaven, right?
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.920]   Just really passionate, intimate moments of worship.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.200]   There have been stories and testimonies shared
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.560]   where we've been moved, it's been encouraging for our souls.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.760]   You've heard sermons, hopefully,
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.440]   that you've said, yes, that's the word for me.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.320]   That's so good, I really resonate with that.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.680]   We've been growing with numbers, as you can see.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.400]   We're busting at the seams with overflow sometimes.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.320]   Community groups have been going.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.320]   All this shows, yes, there has been sort of life
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.000]   in the church, and we thank God for this,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.880]   and it's amazing, and it's a blessing,
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.000]   but it makes being part of this community so exciting.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.520]   You know, coming here on a Sunday is an amazing experience
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.120]   that we all get to enjoy together,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.040]   but still, this is not the main goal,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.320]   because if all we've done is created life
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.800]   inside this building, inside the church,
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.880]   I feel like we've been missing one of the key parts
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.400]   of what it means to be called a disciple,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.280]   to be called a follower of Jesus,
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.360]   and in fact, if this is all that we've achieved,
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.880]   maybe we've been wasting our time even,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.040]   and God might not be as pleased with us
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.480]   as we think that he is, and we risk missing out
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.560]   on one of the main points, one of the most glorious things
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.240]   about what it means to be a disciple,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.120]   to be a follower of Jesus.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.640]   So what is this point I'm talking about?
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.360]   Well, you may have noticed that each time
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.480]   our Bible characters as an encounter with God,
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.460]   right, there is a mission.
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.120]   There is a greater purpose that goes along with it.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.080]   It's not just for that person's benefit.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.480]   In fact, as you've been led through the series,
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.120]   most of the time, it's at great cost and inconvenience
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.600]   for that person, great sacrifice for that person
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.340]   who God encounters, but there's always a bigger impact
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.720]   to those around them, right?
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.560]   We didn't look at the prophet Jeremiah.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.000]   I saved us from that, 'cause Jeremiah's a key example,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.040]   right, of a prophet that encounters God,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.160]   God speaks to him, and he hates it, actually.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.720]   But he's like, "Stop speaking to me, Lord.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.880]   "I can't take this," you know?
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.660]   But it feels like there's like a fire inside his bones,
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.120]   right, you know that Bible verse,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.760]   that because God has spoken to him,
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.300]   he can't help but speak it back out.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.420]   But it's not a comfortable position for him to be in.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.400]   Right, with Jacob, we see, right, he wrestles with God,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.160]   but the greater impact was to inspire
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.660]   the birth of a new nation.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.160]   For Joshua, right, he encounters God,
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.300]   but the bigger part of that was to prove to the Canaanites
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.320]   that God is the only one true God.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.160]   For Daniel, right, as he wrestles with King Darius,
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.720]   and he gets thrown into the lion's den,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.640]   he encounters God in the lion's den.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.040]   The bigger impact that comes from that
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.000]   is the decree that comes at the end
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.340]   where the whole kingdom, king degrees,
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.480]   has to now worship God.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.380]   For Elijah, it was a reminder, right,
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.720]   to turn the Israelites back to God,
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.720]   away from idol worship.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   For Hannah, it was the call for her to, you know,
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.700]   she did eventually give birth to a child,
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.560]   but then she turns around and sacrifices
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.800]   and gives that child back to the Lord.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.000]   And so it's the same for us today, right?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.800]   We don't want to encounter God
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   so that the church on Sundays can be this amazing gathering
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.080]   that we get to enjoy this week, each week.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yes, it's a privilege we get to do this,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.640]   but what we really should be asking for
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.400]   is for God to encounter us so that he can use this body
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.840]   to work through his church, to disrupt our lives,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.620]   to enter out our wills and purposes
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.980]   so that he can be made known to others.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.520]   That is what we're trying to do here this morning.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.280]   God's heart is that we would encounter him
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.580]   so that we can make him known to everyone else.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.640]   Psalm 46 makes this point well.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.540]   Okay, Bible quiz for one second, okay?
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.640]   Finish this verse.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.120]   Be still and know that I am God.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.160]   What comes next?
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.740]   But you know that's not the end of this verse, right?
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.480]   But we sing this song, right, the song "Still,"
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.020]   and we feel God close to us,
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.440]   but the proper end, this is not the end of this verse.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.380]   So it sort of misses the point.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.200]   And now don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing on "Still,"
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.080]   okay, it's one of my favorite songs.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.080]   I love that song.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.400]   It's carried me through some deep seasons
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.080]   of trouble in my life.
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.140]   But the entirety of that verse reads like this.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.860]   Be still and know that I am God.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.340]   I will be exalted among the nations.
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.880]   I will be exalted in the earth.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.620]   In other words, church is not about us.
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.420]   What God's really saying here is be still
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.920]   and let me know that I'm close to you.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.560]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.900]   But what he's saying is be still so that you can see
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.700]   I am God that is exalted over everything in this world.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.020]   And that hits a little bit different
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.980]   when we look at it from that perspective
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.540]   in its entire context.
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.080]   Because it's not just about knowing God,
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.200]   it's about making him known.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.700]   And all this talk about encountering God,
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.340]   yes, it should give you a deeper appreciation of God,
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.480]   a more intimate relationship with him.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.100]   Yes, it should have strengthened your faith,
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.260]   but at the same time, it should have also given you
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.700]   a deeper love for others
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.020]   because this is God's heart for the world.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.680]   It should have also led you to a desire
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.260]   to let other people know about him.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.220]   It should have motivated you to think like,
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.840]   oh my goodness, God is so good, God is so amazing.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.940]   This encounter I've had has been so powerful.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.820]   I cannot possibly keep it to myself anymore.
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.660]   I have to tell someone about this.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.940]   All people everywhere, all the time,
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.960]   need to know who God is.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.700]   And I'm not gonna give myself rest
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.740]   until everyone knows out there
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.820]   that there is a God exalted over everything in this world.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.660]   Amen?
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.800]   This is what our purpose is.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.260]   This is what the church is for.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.640]   In fact, this is so important to God's heart.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.940]   Jesus' last words before he went into heaven
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.540]   was a command to make this happen.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.060]   Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.420]   "has been given to me.
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.000]   "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.960]   "baptizing them in the name of the Father
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.620]   "and of the Son of the Holy Spirit,
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.520]   "and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you,
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.080]   "and surely I'm with you always
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.520]   "to the very end of the age."
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.140]   The Great Commission, Matthew 28.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.420]   In another version of this, he says it like this.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.740]   "But you will receive power
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.260]   "when the Holy Spirit comes on you,
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.320]   "and you will be my witnesses, my declarers,
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.860]   "in Jerusalem, in Judea, and Samaria,
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.580]   "and to the ends of the earth."
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.420]   Acts 1:8.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.860]   Right, notice what Jesus didn't say.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.900]   He didn't say the last thing he said.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.420]   You know, "Hey, don't forget to come to church every Sunday."
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.060]   Right, that's not what he said.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.020]   He didn't say, "Hey, don't forget
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.480]   "to join up to the community groups."
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.720]   He didn't say, "Don't forget to give
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.600]   "your tithes and your offerings."
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.120]   His last and final instructions were to go.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.180]   "Go and tell people about me.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.780]   "Go and tell people who God is.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.580]   "Go and be a witness to people
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.480]   "about your encounters with me.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.600]   "Make disciples, baptize them,
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.160]   "teach them what I've taught you."
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.520]   These are verbs, these are action words
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.740]   called for us to go and do.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.920]   So the question today is,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.480]   are we doing the work of making disciples?
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.300]   Are we proclaiming to Jesus,
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.860]   is to those who don't know him yet.
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.340]   Are we taking action to make Jesus known to everyone?
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.740]   And how do we do this, church?
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.480]   We do this by preaching the word.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.300]   If we want God to be lifted high in this world,
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.860]   if we want Jesus to be exalted as a name above all names,
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.120]   we as his children, as his body, have to preach the word.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.300]   And this is the challenge from scripture
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.780]   for all of us today.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.880]   Now, I'm not gonna try and sugarcoat anything
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.420]   because it is a massive challenge.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.220]   But I believe it's one that we are all,
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.900]   every single person in this room,
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.820]   is called to respond to.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.560]   It's a challenge that if we can commit
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.260]   to doing our very best to meet it,
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260]   this will be the kind of community,
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.460]   the kind of society, the kind of church
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.820]   that Jesus is looking for.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.100]   That's my introduction, okay?
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.500]   So let's look at today's passage.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.780]   I'm reading from 2 Timothy 4, 1 to 5.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.620]   It says this.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.700]   In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.380]   who will judge the living and the dead,
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.560]   and in view of his appearing and his kingdom,
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.940]   I give you this charge.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.760]   I give you this charge.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.920]   Preach the word.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.700]   Be prepared in season and out of season.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.740]   Correct, rebuke, encourage with great patience
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.180]   and careful instruction.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.440]   For the time will come when people
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   will not put up with sound doctrine.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.060]   Instead, to suit their own desires,
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.140]   they will gather around with them
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.800]   a great number of teachers to say
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.540]   what their itching ears want to hear.
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.500]   They will turn their ears away from the truth
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.900]   and turn aside to myths.
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.100]   But you, keep your head in all situations.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.780]   Endure hardship.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.760]   Do the work of an evangelist.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.440]   Discharge all the duties of your ministry.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.300]   Okay, this is good, I think.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.420]   No one's running out the door so far, okay?
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.600]   So I'm gonna take it as, if you're sitting here
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.560]   continuing to listen, I'm gonna take it as
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.220]   thinking that you mean everyone's buying in.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.280]   You're saying, yes, we want to learn
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.500]   what it means to do this.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.420]   Together, we want to preach God's word.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.180]   So we'll get to that in a minute.
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.040]   But before Paul gets to the how, how do we do this,
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.140]   first he gives us a sense of why.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.980]   And the why is actually quite,
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.620]   it's a good reminder for us.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.960]   The why is because time is running out.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.820]   Paul starts his charge with a sense of urgency.
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.220]   He's telling us, this isn't something
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.480]   we can save for later.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.820]   This isn't something that you put on the back burner.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.300]   It's not a slow cooker moment.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.860]   We'll wait and check on it later to see what happens.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.720]   Preaching the word is a challenge
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.740]   that needs to be responded to today, right now.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.260]   Time is of the essence.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.100]   He says it like this, in the presence of God
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.580]   and Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.940]   and in view of his appearing and his kingdom,
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.380]   I give you this charge.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.840]   As Paul was writing this letter,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.340]   he's writing to a young protégé,
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.940]   a young follower, disciple of his, called Timothy.
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.340]   And during the time of Paul's writing,
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.820]   he's in deep trouble, actually.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.260]   He's imprisoned because of his dedication
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.180]   to preaching the gospel.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.500]   And this time, he seems to be aware
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.260]   that his time on earth is limited.
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.940]   He feels like he could be executed any moment now.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.480]   He's had a few run-ins with the law.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.200]   He's been in prison a bunch of times.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.660]   But this time, he just senses,
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.880]   he just knows something is different.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.140]   I don't have much time left, so I have to tell you this.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.780]   But this is also a reminder for us.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.660]   Now, I'm not sure how often you think
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.820]   about the brevity of life.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.380]   I know it's a bit of a morbid thing to think about,
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.740]   but probably day to day,
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.020]   hopefully it's not something we focus on too much, right?
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.220]   It kind of gets us down.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.080]   But as each day goes past, right,
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.700]   the sun goes up, the sun goes down.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.700]   We live our lives.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.820]   We wake up, brush your teeth, hopefully,
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.900]   have breakfast, get ready to work,
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.660]   drop the kids off at school, right,
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.740]   argue with your partner over what to have for dinner, right,
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.420]   send memes to your bestie on Instagram,
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.660]   go shopping, do exercise, you know,
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.180]   decide what to watch on Netflix,
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.020]   and then fall asleep in front of the TV, right?
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.500]   All the day to day routine of things.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.420]   Occasionally, we might look to the future and say,
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.440]   okay, I'm gonna go on holiday here or there sometime.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.300]   But here's the reality, church.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:20.120]   The reality is tomorrow is not guaranteed for any of us.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.140]   Everyone's time on this earth could end at any moment.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.300]   And when that happens, we find ourselves,
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.720]   we're going to find ourselves face to face with Jesus.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.420]   Life on earth will end in two ways.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.860]   Either your body will stop working
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.380]   and there's a whole bunch of stuff
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.300]   that can cause that to happen,
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.620]   or Jesus comes back and nobody apart from the Father
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.420]   knows when exactly that's gonna be.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.320]   The truth is, we don't know.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.560]   We'll never know how close we are to the final day
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.920]   until it actually hits us.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.400]   Which is why the Bible tells us to be careful how we live.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.620]   Which is why it tells us to live each day as people,
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.820]   ready to meet Jesus face to face.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.680]   Because when we do meet him face to face,
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.880]   we have to be ready,
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.640]   because that means it's time for judgment.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.420]   Right, we're gonna meet Jesus face to face,
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.880]   either he's gonna come back to fully reclaim this earth,
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.580]   and when we do see him, there's gonna be some questions
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.080]   he's gonna ask us.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.360]   He's coming back, it says, to judge the living and the dead.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.080]   So what's he gonna judge us on?
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.740]   Well, he's gonna ask us questions, I think,
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.180]   things like this.
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.400]   Have you been a good and faithful servant?
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.540]   Have you loved me with all your heart,
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.280]   mind, soul, and strength?
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.560]   Have you loved others as I have loved you?
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.080]   Have you looked after the widows and the orphans?
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.040]   Have you been a voice of justice to the weak
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.080]   and the oppressed?
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.840]   All of which can be summed up in this question, I think.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.900]   Have you preached the word of God?
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:02.880]   Church, are we living in the light of Jesus' return?
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.800]   Do we live life knowing that it could
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.400]   truly be over at any moment?
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.440]   And because of this, do we realize that there's
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.880]   a severe urgency in the way we live?
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.040]   Because of this, we have to preach the word.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.200]   Preach the word.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.960]   Be prepared in and out of season to correct,
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.360]   rebuke, encourage with great patience
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.280]   and careful instruction.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.760]   Preach the word, church.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.160]   Okay, I know, this is the preacher on a Sunday
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.720]   telling people to preach the word, right?
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.760]   Isn't this your job?
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.160]   We pay you to do this, right?
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.640]   This is what you're employed for, Alison.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.480]   And yes, right, part of what we do on a Sunday
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.640]   is to preach the word.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.120]   And for me on a personal level,
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.480]   I feel like this is something that God's called me to do,
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.680]   I enjoy doing, right?
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.260]   This is a part of my ministry.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.000]   However, the word preach does not mean
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.400]   the preaching, the teaching, unpacking of God's word
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.160]   at 11, 15, 12, and nine of 15 on a Sunday, right?
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.720]   That's not what it means.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.880]   Preach simply means to proclaim or to talk about.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.640]   And when Paul says the word,
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.800]   it's not referring to just the actual words
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.720]   of scripture itself.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.200]   But the word is really referring
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.400]   to the overall Christian message, right?
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.880]   The message of truth and love and hope.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.480]   The message that King Jesus is the one
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.520]   who is the one true king, king of all kings.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.760]   He loved you enough to go to the cross for you
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.400]   as a sacrifice.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.000]   That is life, death, and resurrection
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.120]   means grace, mercy, and forgiveness
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.040]   to all who will put their trust in him.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.800]   But here's the other thing as well,
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.280]   preaching is not just with words.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.080]   Part of preaching also has to be
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.680]   how we live our lives, right?
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.920]   Do we live a life that is in tune with Jesus?
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.760]   Like I was saying just now,
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.240]   do we love others like he does?
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.680]   Do we serve the poor and the marginalized?
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.240]   Are we living in the truth?
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.200]   Do we resist temptation and evil?
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.520]   We preach the word also when we live a life
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.160]   that reflects the life of Jesus.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.040]   So preaching the word means talking about
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.640]   and demonstrating the message of Jesus.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.840]   Now this is something everyone can do.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.280]   Not just the man behind, not just the person,
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.160]   the man or woman behind the pulpit,
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.600]   but every single person.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.040]   And this challenge is one that we have to live by
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.920]   all of the time.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.200]   In Paul's word he says, "In season and out of season."
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.120]   Now if you look through my Instagram algorithm,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.200]   there's a lot of random stuff,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.080]   a lot of parenting tips, pranks you play on people,
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.880]   easy recipes, but also motivational things, right?
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.800]   There's a motivational guy, I'm not gonna call his name,
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.040]   he uses a lot of very colorful language.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.920]   Sometimes I listen to him to get myself
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.640]   to get ready to work out or something like that.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.480]   But if motivational quotes are your thing,
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.240]   you've probably heard some of these, right?
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.880]   Failure to prepare is what?
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.520]   Preparation to fail.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.040]   Ooh, yeah.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.720]   Stay ready so you don't have to get ready.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.040]   All those kind of things.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.760]   Now this is something that I've noticed.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.400]   We like to apply this mindset
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.000]   to certain aspects of our life.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.840]   Stay on the grind.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.760]   When it comes to things like working out
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.160]   or chasing your personal goal, reaching your dreams,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.600]   come on, yeah, no days off, let's get it,
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.600]   let's go, let's go, let's go, right?
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   These are the kind of things
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.480]   that we like to motivate ourselves with.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.760]   But for some reason, when it comes to preaching
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.360]   and living out the word, woof,
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.520]   suddenly we don't feel like we're ready.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.480]   Suddenly we're full of excuses.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.600]   Things like, oh, you know,
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.560]   I don't really know the Bible well enough yet
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.520]   to go and talk to that person about it.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.400]   It's gonna be really awkward if I ask that person
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.280]   and if I can pray for them, right?
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.080]   Now this person's gonna think I'm a weirdo
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.480]   if I ask them if they want to know who Jesus is.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.000]   Oh, no, I don't have much time right now.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.320]   I'm busy.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.520]   I'll serve the community next year.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.280]   It's not just a good time for me right now.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.840]   I'm gonna wait for a better occasion before I,
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.280]   you can fill in the blank.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.640]   But God's word here gives us no room for excuses.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.680]   And the truth is this.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.080]   If we're always waiting for the right time,
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.000]   we'll always find a right reason to put it off.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.400]   This is what procrastination is.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.840]   Like, trust me, okay?
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.520]   Like my wife always says, don't you know,
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.800]   I always say to my wife, excuse me,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.560]   don't remind me every six months, okay?
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.160]   I'm gonna get round to fixing that cupboard
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.600]   in the wardrobe, okay?
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.000]   Procrastination is, I wrestle with it.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.840]   But here's the point.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   If we only preach the gospel in times
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.080]   and conditions were right, it would never get done.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.360]   And the challenge here is this.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.560]   Whether the time seems right or not,
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.200]   that's not what matters.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.640]   What matters is your readiness
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.080]   and your willingness to preach the word.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.520]   Paul is saying here, preaching the word
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.720]   isn't something that we clock in and out of,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.440]   something that we can just complimentalize
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.720]   as part of our lives.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.640]   But this is something,
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.000]   if we want to stay on the grind for something,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.720]   do it for the sake of preaching the gospel.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.400]   Now, I'll caveat with this.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.880]   At the same time, this doesn't constantly mean
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.080]   going around bashing people in the head with a Bible.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.360]   That's not what it's calling us to do either.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.320]   Don't get weird about it.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.040]   Maybe you know people like this too.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.720]   You can't even have a normal conversation.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.160]   Someone like this, say, you ask them for a cup of water
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.320]   because you're thirsty.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.000]   And instead of just handing you a cup of water,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.320]   they'll say something like,
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.280]   oh, I know you're thirsty, brother.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.520]   But do you know something else?
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.480]   You should be thirsty for the Lord,
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.160]   and you need the Holy Spirit in your life, right?
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.320]   Don't be that guy either, okay?
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.960]   That's not what it's calling us to do.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.520]   The key here, okay, is to be prepared.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.080]   Be prepared so that when that moment comes,
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.240]   whenever that is, whether it's convenient or not,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.200]   you are ready to preach the word.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.400]   And we preach this word.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.760]   We believe in this word.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.640]   We live by this word because the word has power.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.640]   In other places, Paul would say that the word
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.840]   is like a double-edged sword, dividing soul and spirit.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.560]   Early in the book of 2 Timothy,
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.760]   the word is described as useful for teaching,
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.120]   rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.760]   In Romans, it tells us that faith comes from hearing
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.280]   the word and the word is heard through,
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.640]   and the message is heard through the word about Christ.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.520]   Isaiah tells us that the only thing
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.120]   that's gonna last forever in this world is the word of God.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.520]   And Paul here says the word has the power.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.240]   It's got power to change people's lives.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.760]   It's got the power to correct, rebuke, and encourage.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.720]   Again, let's pause here to take a look at these words
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.280]   because they sound kind of serious,
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.440]   kind of scary, kind of judgmental.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.000]   But I think what Paul's trying to do here
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.960]   is explain how the power of God's word
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.720]   has an immediate effect on our lives.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.000]   So the first word he says is to correct.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.640]   Correct means that the word is able to guide us back
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.720]   onto the right path.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.780]   Scripture says the word of the Lord is a lamp to my feet
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.080]   and a guide unto my path.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.080]   Now, this might make us a bit nervous
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.480]   because we live in a time and age
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.120]   where things don't really seem to have a right and a wrong.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.160]   And when this is the case,
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.000]   then there isn't really anything to correct.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.520]   What's true for you might not be true for me,
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.440]   but that's okay, right?
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.140]   We'll just agree to disagree.
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.340]   But the fact that God's word can be used to correct
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.900]   means that there is a right way.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.480]   There is an objective truth
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.760]   that we can point people back towards.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.120]   There is a standard which God expects his people to live by
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.040]   and God's word is how we know what that is.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.480]   It's through God's word that we know
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.760]   how he wants us to live.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.400]   It's through God's word that we can always point
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.460]   our lives back when it seems to go off course.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.720]   His word becomes like the north star in our life
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.260]   by which we navigate our life by.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.720]   So it's useful for correcting.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.560]   Now, rebuking is the next word.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.440]   This word might make us even more nervous
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.920]   because it's not just about now
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.120]   pointing out something that is wrong.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.840]   It sounds like it's giving some kind of punishment.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.800]   But again, the world might say, "How dare you?
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   "Who do you think you are
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.960]   "to have the right to rebuke people?"
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.200]   But again, let me give you another way to look at it.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.900]   If we're the ones who know the word, right,
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.180]   and we believe the word is the truth,
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.240]   if we're the ones that know the word is the truth
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.580]   and it's the correct way to live,
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.920]   and we see people around us going down a path
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.920]   that is away from the word, going in the wrong direction,
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.840]   in a direction that's going to lead to pain
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.700]   and destruction and death instead of life
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.600]   and life in the full,
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.200]   then you tell me what's the more loving thing to do,
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.340]   to continue to let that person or those people
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.860]   go down that path, or do everything you can
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.920]   to pull them back towards the truth,
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.240]   to rebuke and to correct, to lead them back
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.560]   on the path that leads to Jesus.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.780]   Okay, but here's the key.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.440]   And this is very important as well,
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.920]   because often this is the part I think we get wrong.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.940]   Because when our methods of correcting and rebuking
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.440]   are not done in the right way,
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.660]   it can actually be really damaging
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.020]   and leads to hurting people.
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.800]   It leads to Christians being labeled
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.380]   and sometimes justifiably as being mean
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.160]   and arrogant, judgmental, hypocritical.
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.820]   So when we talk about correcting and rebuking,
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.040]   it has to be done in the right way.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.220]   Which is why Paul adds at the end of this,
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.500]   the right way to do this is through encouragement.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:24.720]   To encourage means to urge, to come alongside,
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.860]   to support, not to bash over the head.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.540]   Okay, that's not encouraging.
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.060]   And with encouragement, it's also done
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.620]   with great patience and careful instruction.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.580]   You see, we just correct and rebuke
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.780]   without patience and grace,
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.340]   that does not reflect the heart of God.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:47.180]   And we come off as jerks and bad and hypocritical.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.100]   Actually, when we do this,
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.540]   we don't just dishonor the name of yourself,
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.180]   but it also dishonors the name of Jesus.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.940]   It makes him seem like a bad guy who's not caring,
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.580]   who's not patient, who's not full of grace and mercy.
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.120]   We have to understand that it's a journey
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.060]   to learn how to live according to the word,
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.000]   just like it's been a journey for you.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.160]   And we can't expect people to get it right straight away.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.360]   And when we rebuke without careful instruction,
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.680]   it leaves people feeling confused and frustrated.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.400]   It's like telling somebody that they're wrong,
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.120]   but never explaining why.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.720]   And when we correct without patience,
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.040]   it leaves people feeling frustrated and uncared for,
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.400]   like there's some sort of project
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.600]   that we've been sent to fix,
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.160]   just to take that off our list.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.800]   So it has to be done with love, with grace,
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.340]   with mercy, with great patience and encouragement.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.560]   And then Paul wants us to understand this,
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.880]   scripture wants us to understand this,
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.960]   it's not going to be easy.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.040]   Preaching and living out the word
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.800]   is going to come with a whole lot of pushback,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.380]   resistance, and even rebellion.
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.260]   He says it like this,
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.620]   "For the time will come
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.280]   "when people will not put up with sound doctrine.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.060]   "Instead, to suit their own desires,
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.360]   "they will gather around them a great number of teachers
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.220]   "to say what the itching ears want to hear.
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.120]   "They will turn away from the truth
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.980]   "and turn aside to myths."
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.300]   Right, in other words,
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.900]   there is a time coming when people
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.420]   will not like the word that we're going to bring.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.740]   Right, they're not going to like the word
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.180]   that is going to keep them close to God.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.300]   They're not going to like the word
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.180]   that will help them be more like Jesus.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.340]   They're not going to like teaching
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.300]   that's going to keep them strong in the Lord.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.660]   They're not going to like it
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.020]   when they're corrected and rebuked
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.860]   because in their minds, they've already made up
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.880]   the decision of what is right and what is wrong.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.740]   So instead of listening to the truth,
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.140]   instead of listening to what is good,
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.900]   they will simply find people to tell them
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.440]   whatever it is they want to hear,
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.420]   to tickle their ears,
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.580]   to make them feel better about themselves,
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.140]   thinking they can just rest easy,
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.740]   ignoring the fact that like we said at the beginning,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.020]   Jesus is coming back to judge.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.680]   And one day, we're going to have to give an account
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.520]   of how we've lived to him.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:15.180]   This isn't a prophetic warning over the church.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.420]   Now let's look at it this way, okay?
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.580]   Suppose you go for a checkup with your doctor
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.740]   and the doctor tells you,
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.420]   "You know what?
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.260]   "Cholesterol's looking kind of high.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.260]   "Sugar level's kind of high.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.780]   "Your heart's struggling a bit.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.680]   "Maybe lay off the sugary foods.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.440]   "Do more exercise, drink more water, sleep earlier.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.820]   "Make a few changes because you're not healthy."
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.460]   Right, oh, okay, not my recent checkup I hope, okay?
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.860]   But imagine you went to the doctor and they told you that.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.380]   Oh, but you don't want to do that, right?
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.760]   You want doughnuts for life.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.660]   You say, "I'm not here for a long time.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.340]   "I'm here for a good time, right?
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.720]   "I don't want to be skinny and healthy.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.740]   "I want to be fat and happy."
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.940]   Right, and so you keep finding doctors.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.020]   You keep finding doctors until you one find that says,
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.180]   "Oh, yeah, you know, whatever.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.220]   "Yeah, it's high, but it's not like really high."
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.260]   And actually, you know what?
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.940]   Doughnuts actually have a lot of nutrients in them, right?
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.340]   So like doughnuts aren't the worst, okay?
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.140]   So in fact, you know what?
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.020]   I've read a recent report that sweat's not good for you.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.500]   It clogs up your pores, right?
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.340]   And so, and you know, too much water isn't bad.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.100]   You need some electrolytes in your life as well.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.160]   So you know, like fizzy drinks, that's also fine, right?
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.380]   This is the kind of thinking
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.620]   that the church is in danger of, right?
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.460]   The trend that people just wanting to hear
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.540]   whatever they want to hear.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.980]   The trend of people being told, "You're fine.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.820]   "Don't change.
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.420]   "You don't need to discipline yourself.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.580]   "You don't need to believe everything that Jesus says.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.040]   "You do you, and it's all good."
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.780]   Listen, if you want to have your ears tickled,
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.040]   there are gonna be people out there
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.680]   who will tickle your ears in all sorts of ways.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.340]   People like, I'm not gonna go there, okay?
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.580]   But there will be people, okay, that will lie to you, okay?
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.280]   And say things like, "Jesus promised you prosperity.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.700]   "You just gotta name it and claim it,
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.140]   "and then it's yours," right?
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.140]   That's what Jesus says, right?
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.500]   They will take a verse like Psalm 37, four.
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.380]   Look, it says right here in the Bible,
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.780]   "God will give you the desires of your heart."
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.120]   So you're just gonna pray to God,
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.680]   and he's gonna give you everything you want, right?
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.740]   They will twist and turn and corrupt the Word of God
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.760]   so that people can feel as though they're following him
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.900]   without any cost, without any discipline,
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.820]   without any sacrifice in their lives.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.260]   All this to say, if we're gonna commit
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:38.260]   to preaching the Word, make sure we're preaching the Word,
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.580]   not some watered-down, weakened,
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.460]   fluffy, ear-tickling version of it.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.700]   And we have to watch out for this
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.780]   because this version is not the gospel.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.980]   It might be what people want to hear,
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.100]   but it's not gonna be what they need.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.520]   This version of the Word will strip it from its power.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.740]   This version of the Word will carry no ability
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.620]   to set people free, to bring real hope, real life,
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.980]   real salvation to a world out there
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.160]   that's lost and suffering.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:14.300]   Woe to me if I don't preach the gospel.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.460]   If we are truly committed to preaching the Word,
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.280]   this church, brothers and sisters,
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.540]   is what we're gonna have to put up with.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.920]   Which is why Paul points us with this final encouragement.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.740]   But you, keep your head.
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:38.080]   In all situations, endure hardship,
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.080]   do the work of an evangelist,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.080]   discharge all the duties of your ministry.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.520]   In other words, Paul is saying,
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.980]   if you're finding this difficult to do,
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.420]   if it's a challenge, if it's hard,
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.640]   if you're coming against pushback,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.800]   then you're probably doing the right thing.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.360]   We are called to be different.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.520]   We have been called to stand firm.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.720]   We have been called not to turn to this and that,
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.040]   but rather, as it says here,
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.380]   keep your head in all situations.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.520]   Don't be enticed by these false teachings,
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.040]   but focus on what you know is true.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.720]   Endure hardship.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.240]   As we do this, we know it's not going to be easy.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.860]   Like we saw with the people we studied,
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.700]   it's gonna be difficult and painful at times,
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.920]   but let me ask you this, church,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.560]   did you start following Jesus in order to have an easy life?
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:32.300]   I hope not.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.960]   I hope your decision to follow Jesus
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.600]   was because you came to realize that he is the true king.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.680]   You came to follow Jesus because you realized
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.880]   he is the only way, the truth, and the life.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.720]   So we go on announcing Jesus is Lord.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.760]   And no matter what happens, what's required is not success
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.320]   as the world sees success,
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.600]   but rather loyalty and perseverance to preaching his word.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.540]   This is why the task, therefore, is to preach the word,
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.360]   do the work of the evangelist,
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.120]   an evangelist, the one that preaches and lives out
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.700]   and speaks the word of God.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:14.960]   Never stop proclaiming the gospel in everything that you do.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.840]   There is work to be done.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.320]   And like I said, time is short.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.440]   And now that we've encountered God, we know him,
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.560]   we come together each and every Sunday and we encounter him,
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.440]   now it's on us to preach the word.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.600]   You may have classmates or schoolmates
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.000]   who have not yet heard the gospel.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.460]   There may be family out there
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.820]   who are still to discover who Jesus is.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.580]   You have colleagues who are lost and wondering,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.380]   "Where is the purpose and direction of my life?"
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:54.100]   There's an opportunity there to point them towards Jesus.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:58.060]   We have a city, 90-something percent of our city in Hong Kong
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.280]   still don't really know who Jesus is.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.100]   And look around us, church.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.960]   Each week we have more than 1,000 people,
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.860]   that's a lot of people, coming into this building.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.060]   We worship, we connect, we encourage, we love, we care,
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.440]   we give, we do all these things within the building
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.840]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.160]   And I love this church, I love the community,
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.040]   I love being part of the team here,
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.840]   but I'm fully convinced also
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.640]   that this is not all it's meant to be.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.120]   And at the end of every Sunday, I always think to myself,
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:36.520]   "What if, what if every single person here
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.740]   "committed to preaching the word outside of this space?
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.400]   "What if every single person here
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.820]   "committed to help people around them
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.040]   "to come to a faith in Jesus through encouragement,
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   "through love, through patience, no matter how hard it gets?"
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.560]   This is the key, this is how the world is changed.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:03.320]   Look, it started from 12 disciples following Jesus
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.360]   to the billions of Christians
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.760]   that we see worshiping Jesus today.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.200]   And that mission, that call continues for us
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.360]   to go and continue to preach the word.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.940]   This is how we truly fulfill our purpose
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.000]   of lifting up the name of Jesus.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.980]   So church, I challenge us, I challenge you and myself,
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.320]   preach the word in and out of season.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.780]   Carry out your giftings, use them for the glory of God,
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:41.160]   to show the people around you who God truly is.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:45.940]   This is what we've been called to do as a body of Christ.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.940]   If you would close your eyes for a minute,
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.960]   I'm gonna pray for us.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.260]   I'm gonna give us some guidance around what now to do next.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.680]   (soft music)
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:09.120]   As we've been listening and thinking,
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.060]   and maybe the Holy Spirit's already been speaking to you
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:18.000]   about a name, someone that you need to go and talk to,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.300]   a task that he's entrusted you to do.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.180]   (soft music)
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.860]   A challenge, something that you've put off for a while,
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.060]   but now the Lord is reminding you of it.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.980]   Or maybe even a new, a fresh word,
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.420]   something that he's revealed to you
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.860]   in the course of the past 30 minutes or so.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:45.380]   Whatever it is, this is something that literally
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.380]   every single person in this room,
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.400]   without excuse, can respond to.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.700]   And that there's a task for everyone to do.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.700]   There is a person, there's a situation,
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.300]   there's something that you can preach the word of God to
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.060]   in your own context, in where God has placed you.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:12.620]   And so Jesus, I pray that you would reveal
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.820]   those things to us.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:17.380]   We thank you for this, Lord.
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:21.620]   We thank you that you love the world so much,
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:24.380]   and not just the people who are within your church already,
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.360]   but our call, Lord, is to make disciples,
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.700]   to baptize, to glorify your name, to make it known,
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:35.700]   to tell people out there who need salvation
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.380]   that time is short,
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:42.260]   that life on this earth is precious and fleeting,
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.400]   and that Jesus will come back one day.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.500]   So Lord, give us no rest until everyone
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.020]   is calling out your name.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:58.700]   And help us, Lord, use us for the job of preaching your word,
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.300]   for the job of, for the task of, for the purpose of
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.020]   letting people around you, letting people around us
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:10.380]   know who you are, and how great and how glorious you are,
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.420]   but also how loving and kind you are.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.820]   And use this church for this purpose, Lord.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:26.700]   And family, if you would like to respond to this,
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.300]   I just ask you to simply stand up and say,
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.940]   I'm gonna do this, Lord.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.580]   I'm not sure why or how or what it means exactly yet,
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.820]   but I'm gonna trust in you, Jesus,
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.300]   and I'm willing, Lord, to preach the word,
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.420]   to make disciples, to let people around me know about you.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.940]   If you're willing to respond to that, church,
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.520]   I invite you to stand and worship together
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.760]   with your brothers and sisters around you
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   to encourage each other in this journey.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:03.500]   May God lead us and guide us and have mercy on us.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.260]   We do this all in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.100]   Amen.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.000]   (gentle music)
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.580]   (gentle music)
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.640]   you
