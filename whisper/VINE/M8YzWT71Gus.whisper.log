[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Amen. Let's hear it for Ben. Ben and I support the same soccer team, same football team, so
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.200]   it's good to be up there. 11 o'clock tonight, right, we'll be ready for the match. It's so
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.760]   good to be back in Yuen Long and to have the opportunity to be part of this Living the Kingdom
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:32.080]   Parable series. A parable is of course an earthly story with a heavenly meaning, and Pastor Tim has
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.520]   already graciously led us through the parable of the workers in the vineyard and the parables of
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.520]   the lost coin and the lost sheep. I'm speaking today about the parable of the Pharisee and the
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.080]   tax collector. It is taken from Luke chapter 18, and without further ado I'd like us to read it.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.840]   To some who are confident of their own righteousness and look down on everyone else,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:15.200]   Jesus told this parable. Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:24.960]   a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and he prayed, "God I thank you that I'm not like other
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:34.880]   people, robbers, evildoers, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.800]   and I give a tenth of all I get."
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.040]   But the tax collector stood at a distance.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:56.880]   He would not even look up to heaven, but he beat his breast and said, "Lord have mercy on me,
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.680]   a sinner."
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:13.040]   I tell you it was this man rather than the other who went home justified before God.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:25.120]   For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:38.720]   I always think it helps when we study a passage in scripture to see what comes before it
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:47.440]   and to see what comes after it. I always say you know you take a text
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:57.120]   out of context and all that is left is a con, and I'm not here to con you this morning.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:08.400]   But what I did found interesting as I prepared this week, I discovered that this parable
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.320]   is rather like a bridge and I've put on here Shenzhen Bay Bridge just down the road.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:24.720]   You see in the previous chapter, Luke chapter 17, the Pharisees, the religious people,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.960]   were pestering Jesus about the kingdom he had been referring to.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:38.640]   The kingdom against the backdrop of the oppressive and heartless Roman Empire. Jesus had said this,
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.240]   "Once on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.600]   Jesus replied, 'The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed,
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:05.360]   nor will people say, 'Here it is, there it is,' because the kingdom of God is in your midst.'"
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.960]   You see the Pharisees were looking for signs for the coming of the kingdom.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.360]   Jesus tells them not to be looking to signs but to be looking to him.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.920]   The kingdom of God had already come.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.000]   He was it and they failed to recognize him.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:38.960]   Jesus then turns from the Pharisees to his disciples. Remember he's walking towards Jerusalem
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.240]   where he's going to die on a cross. He's going to raise from the dead and then ascend into heaven.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.600]   It won't be long before all these sweet days of hanging out with Jesus,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.680]   walking to Jerusalem, are going to come to an end for the disciples.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:08.400]   At the end of this discourse he tells them two parables. The first one is the parable
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.600]   of the persistent widow which we will have to save for another day. But just look how Jesus began it.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.200]   Verse 1 chapter 18, "Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to tell them they should always pray,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:35.600]   always pray and not give up." He then uses the analogy of a persistent widow
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.840]   to illustrate the difference between an unjust judge and a just God.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.880]   But you might be asking yourself why have I spent all this time describing the approach to the road
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:59.280]   rather than the bridge itself. To use my Shenzhen Bay Bridge analogy, am I enjoying myself
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.920]   in Laofu San eating the seafood rather than taking the Shenzhen Bridge? I tell you why.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:16.400]   Because the Pharisees may at this stage have put two and two together and made five.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:25.440]   And they may have concluded that long public battling prayers would put them on the right road
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:32.480]   to cross the bridge. Follow the rules and you'll be on the right path.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:42.000]   But what I want to do now is to skip forward to the other side of the bridge. Perhaps I'm in Czecho.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.640]   The verses that follow this parable and see what we find there.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:55.840]   Let's move to verse 15 and June has already said these words this morning.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.520]   "People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.480]   saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, 'Let the little
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.880]   children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of God belongs to such of them.'
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:25.120]   Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:34.720]   it." Anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child would not enter it.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.920]   Now notice it does not say anyone who has read the Bible from cover to cover,
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.680]   anyone who prays five times a day, attends community group every week,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.200]   and is faithfully tied to the church will enter the kingdom of God.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.040]   Now you may not have heard this approach before,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:05.200]   but the bridge from persistent prayer
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:16.480]   to childlikeness has apparently come through the parable we are studying today.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:27.280]   You see, the Pharisees could be best described as those who trusted in themselves
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:34.160]   and held others in contempt. That's why Jesus said, "Two men went up to the temple to pray,
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.920]   one a Pharisee, the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed,
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.360]   'God, I thank you I'm not like other people, robbers, evildoers, adulterers,
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:57.040]   even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'"
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.440]   I put these verses on the screen again. Notice how often he uses the word "I."
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:16.560]   "God, I thank you that I am not like other people, these various people. I fast twice a week and I
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:27.360]   give a tenth of all I get." Four times in NIV, the word "I." I went to the ESV this week and it's
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:38.800]   five times. It says, "I give a tenth of all I get." Now the Pharisee is saying this, "I am not like
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:53.440]   other men. It's all about me, me, me, not me, myself and Irene." He is so full of himself.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:02.320]   He is doing all the right things and he wants an A+. He wants a gold star.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.680]   He wants a badge of honor. We see a lot of this in Hong Kong.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:22.080]   On reflection, it was fascinating that Jesus chose a tax collector to compare with a Pharisee.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:30.480]   If we look elsewhere in the Bible, Jesus used the commonly held opinion of tax collectors
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.200]   as an illustration of the final stage of church discipline.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:47.280]   When a person is excommunicated, thrown out of the church, Jesus said in Matthew 18, 17,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:57.440]   to treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector. In other words, the excommunicant
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:05.840]   is to be considered an outsider and a candidate for evangelism. Invite them on the Alpha Course.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:15.760]   By way of background, there are a number of reasons for the low view of tax collectors
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.120]   in the New Testament era. Firstly, no one likes to pay money to the government, right?
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.280]   Especially when the government is an oppressive regime like the Roman Empire of the first century.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:37.120]   Those who collected the taxes for such a government bore the brunt of much public displeasure.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:43.040]   Secondly, the tax collectors in the Bible were Jews.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.760]   And they were Jews who were working for the hated Romans.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.440]   These individuals were seen as turncoats, traders to their own countrymen.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.480]   Rather than fighting the Roman oppressors, the publicans were helping them
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.520]   and enriching themselves at the expense of their fellow Jews.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:11.840]   And thirdly, it was common knowledge that the tax collectors cheated the people they collected from.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.920]   By hook or by crook, they would collect more than required and keep the extra for themselves.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.040]   Some jacks all right.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   Everyone just understood that was how it worked.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:37.840]   Remember the tax collector Zacchaeus in his confession to the Lord mentioned his past dishonesty.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.920]   But this is where the parable turns itself on its head.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.680]   Verse 13.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.480]   But the tax collector stood at a distance.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:59.120]   He wouldn't even look up to heaven but beat his breast.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:09.440]   Said, "God, have mercy on me, a sinner."
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:21.040]   Wow, wow, wow. Let's pause for a moment and give Jesus the last word.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:30.640]   I tell you that this man rather than the other went home justified before God.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:41.040]   For those who exalted themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:51.040]   Let's look at what's happened here. The guy who justified himself was humbled.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:14:00.720]   The guy who humbled himself was justified.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.520]   This my friends is the kingdom of God.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.160]   Let me say that again. This my friends is the kingdom of God.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:22.480]   Now to help us further, let me give you a modern version of this parable.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:30.400]   In the modern version of this parable, I chose to call the Pharisee, Religious Ron.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.360]   Sorry if there's anyone here called Ron.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:47.040]   On a given Sunday, Religious Ron walked into the church with his head held high and his chest out.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:58.800]   As he walked into the sanctuary, Religious Ron spotted the town drug pusher,
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:08.240]   the town troublemaker, sitting on one of the back pews. You wish you hadn't sat on the back pew today,
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:17.520]   right? He had been tried. He'd been found guilty. He'd spent time in prison and was recently paroled.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:28.800]   Religious Ron was disgusted to see such a man in church. So he told the head usher,
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:36.480]   to keep a close watch on the man, who we will call Larry Lowlife.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:48.800]   Larry Lowlife had finally realized he needed to change the road on which he'd been traveling.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:54.880]   He desperately needed God's help and he was in church.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:03.360]   At the beginning of the pastoral prayer time, the pastor always gives at least 30 seconds
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:13.840]   for the congregation to quietly pray before he began his prayer. Religious Ron's silent prayer
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:24.080]   was more about his own goodness than about his spiritual need. Heavenly Father, I thank you that
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:31.840]   I've been a deacon of this church for more than 20 years. Oh, you've blessed my business so much,
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:39.200]   I'm able to give more than a tithe to the church. I haven't missed Sunday service for 10 years,
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:46.800]   even when I was sick. And you know that I used to sing in the choir. I don't smoke cigarettes,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:57.280]   drink alcohol or cuss on Sundays. I don't use or sell drugs like the drug pushing punk on one of
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.680]   our back rooves, who has the audacity after getting out of prison to attend our church today.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:12.960]   And Lord, please help our football team, that's soccer for US people,
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:20.560]   help our football team clobber the local Baptist church in the church football league on Tuesday
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:30.240]   night. Amen. Religious Ron was so full of pride, he could strut even when he was sitting down.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:39.120]   Meanwhile, Larry Lowlife on one of the back rows was praying this,
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:52.960]   God be merciful to me, for I'm a sinner. I desperately need your help to get my life turned
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:18:06.720]   around so that I can go in the right direction. Lord, please forgive me and cleanse me.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:17.360]   I open my life to you. Let me read verse 14 again. I tell you it was this man,
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:23.360]   rather than the other, who went home justified before God.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:31.040]   For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:39.840]   Hopefully this modern parable of religious Ron and Lowlife Larry will help us, you and me,
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:48.720]   to enter the worship services here at the Vine with a desire to primarily focus on three things.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.760]   Firstly, the goodness and the greatness of God.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:02.080]   Secondly, to genuinely worship him by focusing primarily upon your spiritual needs.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:10.880]   And thirdly, to offer your life, to serve him in the ways that bear witness of his love to others
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:20.640]   in specific ways. In the original parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector, Jesus said,
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:29.040]   there are two attitudes that people generally display in worship. Number one,
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:39.920]   I'm proud of my goodness. Pride loves to use the personal pronouns I and me.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:47.120]   It seldom omits a need. It does not focus on the needs of others.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:57.120]   Or secondly, I desperately need God's mercy.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:06.480]   I've got a question for you. Which of these two attitudes best describes
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.440]   your spirit as you enter church on a Sunday morning?
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:19.680]   Before I finish, I want to push this a stage further, if you don't mind.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:26.080]   I want to get really personal. I want to give you a question.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.640]   If you were to die tonight and stand before the Holy God,
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:41.040]   on what basis would you seek entrance into heaven?
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:52.560]   Think about it. I'm going to say it again. If you were to die tonight and stand before the Holy God,
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.520]   on what basis would you seek entrance into heaven?
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:08.560]   I mentioned earlier the parable of the persistent widow or the unjust judge that preceded this
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:16.160]   parable. It ends with the question, however, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:23.280]   on the earth? Since now we're getting very serious. We're talking about our eternal destinies.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   I cannot think of anything more important for us to hear the truth of Jesus' message in this parable.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:41.760]   You see, if we were to go out from here today and ask people in Yoho Mall, even those who are
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.760]   regular churchgoers, are you sure of your eternal destiny, that you'll go to heaven when you die?
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.840]   I guarantee that the prevalent answer would be, no, I'm not sure.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:01.360]   If we probe a little bit further and ask them why they were not sure,
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:08.720]   we'd probably hear things like, I'm not sure I'm good enough.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:20.640]   Reinforcing a widely held belief that somehow, somehow our good deeds will be measured up against
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:27.040]   our bad ones on some kind of spiritual scorecard. Salvation by KPI, as you might say.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.800]   That we somehow need to earn our way into heaven by being good.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:38.640]   Even though we know we are just not able to achieve this.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:48.560]   The ultimate difficulty that any human being will encounter is this. How can any unjust person
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   in the presence of a just God stand at the Last Judgment?
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:12.480]   The only way, the only way we can stand is to be justified,
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:22.000]   to be declared just. And when we say that justification is by faith alone,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.560]   that is simple shorthand for justification by Jesus Christ alone.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:35.520]   Faith is the sole instrument by which we can grab hold of Christ and His justice is transferred to
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:45.600]   us. God imputes or counts the righteousness of Jesus to those who put their trust in Him.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.920]   But I tell you today,
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.400]   if you trust in yourself,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:05.840]   you stand by yourself. The only way you will ever stand before a just and holy God
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:12.400]   is as one clothed in the righteousness of Christ. You add nothing to it.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:22.240]   Jesus ended this little parable by saying, I tell you that this man, the tax collector,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.160]   went home justified before God. The man couldn't even look up to heaven.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:39.760]   He couldn't get near to the holy of holies, could only beat his chest and repent in sin,
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.240]   plead for the mercy of God and throw himself at the mercy of the court.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:51.840]   He walked out the door and went home justified.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:25:07.600]   My friends, do not leave here today until you tell the Lord God Almighty that you are a sinner
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.640]   and cannot stand apart from His mercy and grace.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:23.200]   If you throw yourself and your soul to Him and His mercy, clinging to Christ, you will go home
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:35.040]   justified. Jesus said of the spiritual man, the Pharisee, the one who came so close,
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:44.080]   so close to the holy place, the tax collector went home justified rather than the other.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:51.120]   The Pharisee went home that day and he continued to tithe and he continued to fast,
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.960]   but he remained an unjustified person.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:05.040]   If you were to die tonight and stand before God and God said to you,
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:12.000]   "Why should I let you into my heaven?" What would you say?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:23.520]   I hope you would say, "Because of Jesus, because He's my only hope,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:32.080]   I put my trust in Him. Everything else is sinking sand."
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:44.640]   Then He will look at you. He'll say, "Please come in. My son is already here.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:56.160]   He's prepared a place for you that you might bask in His glory now and forevermore."
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.960]   Let's close our eyes and ask the worship band to come back.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:13.920]   We're going to be singing that song, "Come to the altar again."
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:21.760]   I joked about it before I preached the sermon. I think the song had already done my sermon for me.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:27.920]   It's a male song. I want you to use that song
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:39.120]   to come back to the altar on your knees before Jesus where the place is forgiveness.
