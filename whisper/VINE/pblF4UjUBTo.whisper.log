[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   Disclaimer, what I'm about to share,
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.520]   I've obtained the permission
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.020]   of the person I'm gonna mention.
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.600]   My family were in Singapore last December.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.720]   I remember this following conversations
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.040]   took place in Singapore because
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.320]   whenever we're in Hong Kong,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.160]   I'm the one driving and everybody else sit at the back.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.600]   When we're in Singapore,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.460]   mommy's driving and I got to sit at the back
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.320]   with the girls, with Megan and Mabel.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.760]   And so there was one night we were,
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.440]   I forgot what we did, we were out for dinner
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.280]   and we were just driving home.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.200]   I was seated at the back with the girls.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.320]   And Megan, all of a sudden, she asked this question.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.320]   She was asking, "Daddy, why do people die?"
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.480]   My daughter just turned four last November.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.400]   So I wasn't quite ready to have this conversation
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.200]   with a four-year-old talking about
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.120]   the meaning of life and death.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.880]   I wasn't prepared at all.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.680]   And so she asked, "So why do people die?"
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.160]   And I tried to come up with all sorts of science,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.280]   biology, tried to make up something,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.320]   tried to downplay it to like what you tell,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.240]   chat GPT, can you explain why we die to a four-year-old?
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.580]   So I tried my best without chat GPT.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.000]   And then she asked, "So am I gonna die?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.480]   "Is daddy gonna die?
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.520]   "Is mommy gonna die?"
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.760]   And as we progress in that conversation,
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.760]   you could sense the emotion that she's harboring.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.800]   And ultimately she said, "I don't wanna die.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.280]   "I don't want daddy and mommy to die."
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.680]   And you can feel that kind of sadness.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.040]   And I'm telling you, I've been a parent
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.960]   for about a little bit more than four years
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.560]   and I was not prepared to have that conversation
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.920]   with my daughter.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.880]   I thought they don't ask these kind of questions
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.960]   until they're much older.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.560]   I don't know they could understand
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.680]   or have the concept of death in their tiny brains,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.200]   but ever like developing brain at the age of four,
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.000]   I was totally surprised.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.560]   But that night I learned one thing,
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.120]   that even my daughter was still young,
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.080]   she was only four.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.840]   She didn't just catch the idea of death.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.720]   It comes with natural fear.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.640]   She was afraid of the concept of death,
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.200]   of dying, of being separated from her parents.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.160]   I could sense fear inside.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.560]   And that night I realized as human beings,
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.560]   we perhaps we were born with this kind of fear for death,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.680]   this kind of fear for separation.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.880]   Maybe like we don't even have to prepare ourselves.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.800]   We don't even have to pick it up, learn it somewhere.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.280]   It's kind of inborn in us.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.760]   That's what I realized that night.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.840]   I don't know about you.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.400]   I don't know when was the last time you faced a situation
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.320]   like that, not talking to a toddler about death,
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   but maybe you were in a situation where you faced death,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.840]   or you faced the death of someone who is very close to you.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.160]   And I don't know what kind of emotions,
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.280]   feelings that has brought you.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.960]   Last week we were here for Easter Sunday.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.000]   And if you were here,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.480]   you probably would remember a message from Pastor Tim
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.360]   talking about the resurrection of Jesus
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.720]   from the narrative of the book of John in chapter 20,
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.360]   where John and Peter ran to the tomb
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.680]   and they discover something.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.000]   They discover that cloth
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.680]   that was supposed to cover Jesus's face.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.080]   It was put very neatly folded.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.840]   It was there.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.240]   And then he brought us all the way back
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.280]   to 700 years before Jesus,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.120]   to a prophecy of Isaiah talking about that
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.680]   even 700 years before Jesus God had told his people
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.160]   that one day he would remove that face cloth,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.280]   that shroud that is covering his people.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.120]   He's going to remove the power of sin and death
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.280]   once and for all.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.680]   So what we caught last week was this message
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.520]   that Jesus's resurrection means that sin is defeated
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.320]   and that power of death, it's no longer the final story.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.560]   I see some of you nodding,
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.120]   yes, I know you were there last week.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.960]   But as you were listening, or as I was listening,
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.560]   I don't know if I was the only one who asked this question,
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.400]   that if this were true,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.800]   why are we still attending funerals?
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.240]   Why are we still attending Christian funerals regularly?
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.640]   Last year, before I came back, like came on full time,
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.720]   last year, God gave me some opportunities.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.000]   I've been, one of my side gigs
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.560]   were to host funerals for different people
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.680]   from different churches
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.240]   or people who don't have a home church.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.920]   So I've hosted a lot of funerals
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.880]   to a point that I start asking myself,
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.560]   I couldn't help but ask myself,
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.680]   or I started to realize that one day,
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.120]   those people that I love or those people who love me,
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.760]   they would inevitably attend my funeral.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.240]   And I start to wonder if this was true,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.160]   if God has defeated the power of death,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.080]   why am I still attending funerals after funerals
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.800]   after funerals, Christian funerals?
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.520]   We were supposed to be sharing the victory
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.200]   over sin and death.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.480]   Why am I here?
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.320]   What am I doing here, seated like at this funeral?
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.640]   And then I realized I'm not the only one
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.160]   who's been asking these questions
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.840]   in the last 2000 years of church history.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.080]   I'm not the only one struggling with this idea.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.960]   I'm not the only one wondering,
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.080]   if we share the victory over death,
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.360]   then why are we still experiencing physical death
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.240]   in our lifetime?
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.520]   Why everybody on earth right now
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.000]   still have to go through that?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.120]   And I've been asking myself this question.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.880]   And then I slowly realized or remember
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.200]   that this is actually one of the questions
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.240]   that the early church, the early Christians,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.120]   they struggle with that too.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.760]   So if you open this book, open the Bible
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.040]   to the New Testament, look at the letters Paul wrote,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.080]   you will find a number of chapters
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.280]   that he was writing on this matter,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   that why Christians, they were asleep
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.280]   or why Christians, they died
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.400]   even before the coming back of Jesus
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.480]   or why Christian died, what does that mean?
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.920]   And so today I'm gonna jump into this book called,
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.680]   this letter called the First Corinthians.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.840]   I'm gonna look at chapter 15.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.000]   In fact, Paul dedicated the entire chapter to talk about it,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.600]   but I'm gonna read from verse 20.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.560]   And you can read with me.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.040]   Paul says, "But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.080]   "and the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.560]   "For since death came through a man,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.840]   "the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.440]   "For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.380]   "but each in turn, Christ, the first fruits,
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.960]   "then when he comes, those who belong to him."
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.600]   So here, where is it?
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.440]   Those who have fallen asleep over here.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.880]   Those who have fallen asleep,
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.520]   it naturally means those people who have died,
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.480]   who have passed away, those Christians in the church
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.240]   and their physical life ended.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.120]   And this is what Paul meant,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.320]   like when he said those people have fallen asleep.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.000]   And then Paul used a very special
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.080]   and theologically rich term to describe Jesus.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.920]   He used this word first fruits.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.160]   And what we need to know that this is not a random word.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.480]   This is not just, oh, okay, this word sounds cool.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.520]   Let me pick this word.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.440]   He chose this word like purposefully.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.240]   And today I just wanna look at this word
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.080]   a little bit with us,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.880]   especially let's look at where it came from
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.800]   in the Old Testament.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.280]   We're gonna look at some,
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   I'm gonna briefly go through the salvation history
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.960]   of Israel with us all.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.720]   And maybe we all remember there is this event called Exodus
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.320]   where God led his people Israelites out of Egypt,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.240]   out of slavery,
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.560]   and he was about to bring them into the promised land.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.680]   And we know that God brought them out
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.960]   on this day called the Passover.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.560]   That's around the time we celebrated Easter, right?
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.800]   Passover, Jesus is the Passover lamb.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.240]   And we celebrated the fact that,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   the blood of the Passover lamb covered the doors.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.280]   And that's why God didn't kill
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.680]   the firstborn of the Israelites,
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.240]   but then they were leaving Egypt and God was telling them,
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.920]   hey, you guys have to remember Passover
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.320]   for generations to come.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.840]   You need to celebrate or remember that every year.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.320]   But then when they were in the wilderness,
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.200]   right before they went into the promised land,
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.840]   God told them this.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   So I'm gonna read from Leviticus chapter 23.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.680]   It says this,
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.080]   "The Lord said to Moses,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.560]   "speak to the Israelites and say to them,
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.920]   "when you enter the land,
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.360]   "I'm going to give you and you reap its harvest,
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.000]   "bring to the priest a sheaf of the first grain
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.880]   "you harvest.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.640]   "He's to wave the sheaf before the Lord,
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.040]   "so it will be accepted on your behalf.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.440]   "The priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath."
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.120]   And verse 14 says this,
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.000]   "You must not eat any bread or roasted or new grain
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.400]   "until the very day you bring this offering to your God.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.480]   "This is to be the lasting ordinance for generations
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.760]   "to come wherever you live."
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.320]   This day or this ceremony
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.640]   is known as the offering of the first fruits
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.280]   or it's called the feast of the first fruits.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   It's indeed one of the seven feasts of the Israelites.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.720]   One of the days that they must remember for all generations
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.400]   and the feast of first fruits,
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.760]   it actually marked the offering of the first portion
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.680]   of the barley harvest to the Lord.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.000]   And it symbolizes,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.320]   "Hey guys, come on now,
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.680]   "it's the start of the harvest season.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.000]   "It's time to go and take a harvest."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.580]   And the Israelites were to harvest a sheaf
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.320]   or a bundle of grain of the first ripe barley
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.520]   and bring it alongside all the other offerings to the priest
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.800]   and the priest would wave it before God
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   as a symbolic offering of gratitude and faith.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.960]   It's to say thank you to God
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.760]   because we know that even this first grain,
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.760]   it came from God, it's provided by God.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.200]   It's a gesture of faith
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.280]   because bringing this to God to wave it
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.800]   is the declaration that God,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.720]   I know for the rest of the season,
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.120]   I know there will be a harvest this year
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.680]   and I know this upcoming harvest,
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.920]   it's also from you or it's your provision.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.720]   So it's a gesture of gratitude,
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   but it's also a gesture of faith,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.160]   saying God, whoever goes bring their offering to God,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.500]   saying, "God, I know what I'm holding in my hand right now,
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.720]   "this first grain, it is from you.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.060]   "And I also know that you will provide for me
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.220]   "for the rest of the year,
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.200]   "for the rest of the harvest season."
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.240]   This is gratitude and faith at the same time,
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.320]   acknowledging God as the source of provision
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.560]   and trusting him for the rest of the harvest.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.200]   This is to say, "God, I trust in you.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.000]   "I know you are my provider."
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   So now we know what this feast of first fruit is,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.240]   but I'm telling you that the when, it's equally important.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.520]   Just now we read from that verse,
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.800]   it says the priest is to wave it
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.840]   on the day after the Sabbath.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.800]   But this is not just any random Sabbath.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.900]   As you know, there are 52 weeks in the year.
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.280]   So there are 52 Sabbaths in one year, which one it is.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.800]   Just now I said this particular day,
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.680]   the feast of first fruit,
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.680]   it's actually linked all the way back to the Passover event.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.560]   So for Israelites, every year after Passover,
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.080]   they're going to celebrate this,
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.840]   also this festival called the Unleavened Bread.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.040]   And also there will be a day
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.160]   that is the feast of first fruits.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.360]   It happens all within a week.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.280]   So this feast of first fruit, it's actually celebrated
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.720]   or this offering, it's done on the day
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.960]   following the Sabbath after the Passover.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.000]   Does that ring a bell for anyone?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.680]   Okay, let me ask you this question.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.840]   When was Jesus betrayed and captured?
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.560]   What was he doing right before he was captured?
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.000]   He was praying, what was he doing before he was praying?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.360]   He was having the Passover meal with his disciples.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.440]   Jesus was actually captured and betrayed
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.240]   on the night of Passover.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.160]   And then the very next day he was shrouded
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.240]   and he was nailed on the cross.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.980]   He was crucified and that was Good Friday, right?
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.720]   We just remember Good Friday about a week ago.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.220]   And that was Good Friday.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.200]   And the soldiers or whoever the authorities,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.520]   they have to quickly remove his body from the cross
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.200]   and put it in the tomb because after Good Friday,
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.480]   the very next day was actually Sabbath.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.560]   They were not supposed to do any work on Sabbath.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.520]   So they have to deal with the body as soon as possible.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.160]   And guess what happened the day after Sabbath,
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.960]   which is a Sunday, which we now know as Easter.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.720]   That was the day when the body of Christ
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.180]   was raised from dead to life.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.720]   In other words, the resurrection actually happened
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.680]   on the feast of the first fruits.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.040]   You see, when God ordained the feast of the first fruits,
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.440]   like thousands of years before Jesus even walked on earth,
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.840]   he already planned this.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.120]   That after the Passover, after the suffering,
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.000]   there was one day that resurrection was gonna take place.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.880]   And church, you know what?
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.220]   We always talk about Jesus being the Passover lamb,
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.880]   that he sacrificed himself,
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.700]   that he took our sin on the cross.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.980]   We talked about Jesus as that lamb,
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.780]   on God's lamb.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.700]   We talk about his role in the Passover, removing our sins.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.820]   But Paul here, he reminded us one thing,
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.420]   that Jesus, the resurrected Jesus,
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.380]   he was also the first fruit.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.540]   And if you think about the meaning
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.220]   of the feast of first fruits,
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.860]   it's for people to bring their offering to God
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.800]   and wave it to God and offer their first fruit to God
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.940]   and say, God, I know you have provided this first fruit,
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.460]   and I know in the same way
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.900]   you're gonna provide the harvest this year.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.380]   That was what it means.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.580]   It means that God has provided Jesus,
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.940]   the resurrected body of Jesus, as the first fruit.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.940]   And in the same way, there is a guarantee.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.140]   We trust in God that there's gonna be a harvest
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.100]   of resurrected body in the age to come.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.720]   And Paul was saying that that was when Jesus comes back.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.500]   Those who belong to him will experience the exact same thing.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.340]   The harvest will be the exact same experience
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:59.220]   as the resurrection body of Jesus.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.260]   So Jesus being the first fruit and saying,
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.400]   hey, you know what?
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.580]   Now, he is our guarantee.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.940]   We know that he was raised in bodily.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.820]   And so we know that one day at the end of time,
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.420]   when Jesus comes back again on that day,
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.820]   we know our bodies, our dead body,
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.500]   not just dying, probably very dead,
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.140]   our very dead bodies would rise again.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:32.140]   It's this body, this flesh that would rise again.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.420]   And so this is what Paul was trying to communicate
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.980]   to us Christ as the first fruit.
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.920]   He is the guarantee of the full harvest,
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.500]   the future bodily resurrection of all
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.780]   who belong to him at his coming.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.740]   And just as those who approach the feast of first fruits,
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.500]   knowing that God is the one who provided first sheaf
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.140]   and he will provide the full harvest now,
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.060]   we can know for sure that God is the one who gave us Jesus,
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.540]   who raised Jesus from the dead
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.660]   and he will also raise us from the dead
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.500]   like bodily, physically one day.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.020]   And in other words,
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:17.020]   God has already raised Jesus from the dead,
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.220]   but he's yet to raise you and me
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.460]   or whoever we knew that has passed from the dead.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.820]   Perhaps you have heard these two phrases
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.020]   or terms in the same sentence before already,
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.160]   but not yet.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:38.380]   This phrase or this terms was used to describe
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.880]   the tension that Christians are facing
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.300]   when the kingdom of God had been inaugurated
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.060]   through Jesus's life, death and resurrection
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:51.660]   that we already experienced that redemption
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.780]   and the renewal in the present
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.700]   because of what Jesus has done.
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.020]   Last week we celebrated our baptism.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.700]   There are five people getting baptized
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.540]   and I've read some of the testimonies.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.340]   It's all beautiful stories of how Jesus came
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.860]   and changed their lives,
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.820]   turned things upside down for them.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.220]   They have experienced the transformative power of Jesus,
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.140]   of his cross.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.220]   And this is something because of what Jesus has done
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.040]   in the past, because of something that has already happened.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.020]   Now we can experience that already.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.100]   We can already experience the power of transformation
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.380]   in your life, in my life as well,
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.540]   but there awaits the ultimate fulfillment
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.620]   of this future resurrection, this final judgment
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.260]   and the restoration of all things.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.740]   This is yet to happen.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.100]   This is the not yet of this tension.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.020]   And I do wanna highlight this word tension
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.540]   that I mentioned here.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.140]   The reality of physical death as human experience,
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.740]   despite the spiritual born again experience in Jesus
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.780]   and the victory that overseen in death that we share in him,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.660]   that's a real tension in life.
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.100]   We know we have that power to overcome sin and death,
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.180]   but yet we're still experiencing physical death
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.780]   in this lifetime.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.500]   That reality brings separation between us and our loved ones.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.320]   It creates a tremendous sense of loss,
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.180]   even a four year old would understand,
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.300]   even a four year old would express
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.940]   that kind of sense of loss,
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.420]   that kind of shock or that kind of sadness.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:33.020]   Yeah, that sense of sadness,
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.620]   that sense of frustration,
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.280]   that sense of shock and even fear,
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.580]   it's real in our lives.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.300]   Maybe we have felt that before.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.380]   We experience physical weakness
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.120]   and loss of strength and energy as we're aging.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.160]   We become weaker and weaker.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.120]   You can feel that I no longer run as fast as I used to,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.200]   can't finish 10K as fast as I used to.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   I'm feeling, oh, I can't really push that much of weight
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.760]   'cause I'm not training with Benedict and Ivan,
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.960]   not training enough, so I'm feeling weak.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.320]   I can feel that.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.680]   But I'm sure some of us,
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.640]   we've had the experience of standing next to a deathbed
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.260]   and watching life being like sucked out
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.280]   of someone we do care a lot about.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:27.920]   The experience of death, physical death, is so real.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.140]   It becomes a tension in a Christian life.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.880]   And we have yet to experience
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.380]   or witness any bodily resurrection in our midst.
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.360]   We haven't seen it.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.920]   It could be so hard for us to imagine
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.760]   what resurrection actually looks like
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.280]   'cause we haven't seen it, picture it.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.760]   We haven't witnessed it ourselves in our lifetime.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.360]   But on the other hand,
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.520]   I think it's easier for us
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.680]   to witness spiritual transformation.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.040]   We would understand what it means
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.160]   to be spiritually born again.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.440]   We could feel the presence of the Holy Spirit,
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.680]   kumbaya, oh God, I feel so warm in my heart.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.080]   I can feel that.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.260]   We could see the fruits of spirit in our lives.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.180]   Wow, Chapman, you look different.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.520]   Not just like (speaks in foreign language)
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.480]   but oh, you're more gentle.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.320]   He said, oh yeah,
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.680]   because there's the fruit of the spirit in my heart.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.720]   You can experience that.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.560]   You can see literal transformation
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.700]   and changes in people's life.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.600]   It's real.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.320]   We can experience that.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.160]   And sometimes, because that's what we can experience
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.360]   or understand or feel,
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.800]   we gradually focus more on what we can experience
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.920]   and witness.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.920]   We focus more on the spiritual aspect of salvation
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.460]   to a point that we anchor our beliefs of our future
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.500]   solely in the spiritual.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.860]   Well, this can lead to a view of death like,
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.460]   oh, when I die, I know I'm going to heaven.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.400]   Or my soul is going to heaven.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.320]   Or what about your body?
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.600]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.520]   My body will just be burned into ashes.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.480]   And then I don't know what I'm gonna do with my ashes.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.220]   Maybe in a container, maybe in a garden.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.140]   My body will be no more.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.720]   But my soul, my soul will be in heaven,
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.120]   like with Jesus.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.960]   I'll be with him.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.020]   That's kind of a view of afterlife.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.560]   Well, this is a very popular view.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.100]   It's even a line to take when we're sharing the gospel
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.240]   with people around us,
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.760]   maybe with our friends and family.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.480]   Hey, you wanna believe in Jesus?
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.960]   If you believe in Jesus, after you die,
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.000]   your soul is going to heaven.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.720]   That's what we tell people.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.120]   It's very popular.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.700]   Yet, I would say it's not the most
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.060]   biblically accurate statement.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.160]   That's what the Corinthian church
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.920]   was actually struggling as well.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.720]   Let me tell you this.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.200]   This church, the Corinthian church,
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.080]   they were in a part of the world called the Roman Empire.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.360]   And so in Roman Empire,
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.920]   they're affected by the Greco-Roman philosophy.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.680]   In the Greco-Roman philosophy,
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.700]   they see the world as two parts,
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.800]   or they see that there are two worlds,
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.280]   bear with me, this is philosophy.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.340]   Are you ready?
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.560]   This is Western philosophy.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.840]   Okay, tell the person next to you,
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.440]   hey, you're gonna be a philosopher after this.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.280]   No, you're not.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.520]   Right, so there are two parts of the world.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.440]   There is the spiritual world.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.760]   That's the beautiful, that's the perfect world.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   And there's the material world.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.960]   Spiritual, immaterial,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.400]   and then you have the physical world, the material world.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.880]   Or material world, I tell you,
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.720]   it's created by the lesser gods.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.000]   It's not as good, it will corrupt.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.880]   See, look at your body.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.800]   That's the best proof.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.200]   You get wrinkles, you get pimples,
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.440]   you get, you know, your skin get like bad,
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.160]   and you know, you get old,
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.120]   and your body decay or deteriorate at first.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.580]   And you know that that's the proof
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.280]   that the material world is not as good
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.840]   as the spiritual world.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.640]   And that's how the Greco-Roman people
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.080]   understand their everyday life,
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.000]   or their world.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.960]   And so if you tell the Corinthian church
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.040]   that you know what, you guys are going
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.680]   to have your body resurrected,
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.480]   they'll be like, are you kidding me?
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.320]   My body?
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.280]   I don't need it.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.400]   I just need my spirit.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.720]   Oh, my spirit in heaven with God.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.680]   My body, oh, my body is bad, it's corrupted.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.840]   It's just gonna like decay there.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.440]   I don't need my body anymore.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.040]   They had a hard time believing
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.040]   that there is actually a bodily resurrection.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.160]   And so if you go back and read Go Home
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.440]   and read chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians,
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.840]   you will see that Paul tried to,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.600]   he actually spent the first half of the chapter
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.720]   arguing, hey, guys, hey, dude,
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.680]   there is actually bodily resurrection.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.040]   What else do you think Jesus is doing here?
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.900]   He was trying to convince them.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:59.260]   But what is interesting is that after 2,000 years,
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.760]   our view of body and spirit, body and soul,
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.960]   it's not too much of a difference
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.220]   from those people 2,000 years ago.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.320]   We sometimes, even a church, so popular to say that,
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.160]   when we die, our spirit, our soul will go to heaven,
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.600]   be with Jesus, and you don't know where your body goes.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.320]   Maybe you will just get burned and died and somewhere.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.200]   We also share a similar view.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   We also have a slightly not very biblical view of afterlife.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.360]   And that's what Paul was trying to tell his church.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.920]   One of the theologians of our time in the UK,
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.720]   his name is N.T. Wright, he wrote this,
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.400]   which is quite on point about this problem.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.360]   He says, "One of the greatest difficulty
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.100]   "in preaching the gospel in our days
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.900]   "is that everyone assumes that the name of the game,
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.540]   "it's ultimately to go to heaven when you die,
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.880]   "as though there were the last act in the drama.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.940]   "But that's wrong.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.200]   "Heaven is important, but it's not the end of the world.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.680]   "God will make new heavens and new earth
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.720]   "and give us new bodies to live and work
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.520]   "and take delight in his new creation."
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.020]   Heaven is important, going to heaven, yes,
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.820]   that's great, but that's not the end game.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.200]   That's not all, not just your soul going somewhere.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.440]   So scripture ultimately promises
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.120]   not just a disembodied soul in heaven,
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.240]   but a resurrected body in a renewed creation.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.660]   Let me say that again.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.560]   Christian scripture, the view of afterlife
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.760]   that we actually teach is this,
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.000]   that is a promise that is not just a disembodied soul
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   in heaven, but a resurrected body in a renewed creation.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.760]   This is what God wants for us, what he has planned for us,
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.320]   what Jesus has died for, when he became the first fruits.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.520]   That's the guarantee of what we are going to get.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.200]   We need to know that God was the one
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.360]   who created physical bodies for humans in the first place.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.840]   And God saw our bodies, and he said,
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.200]   Genesis chapter one says, "It is good."
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.960]   When God looked at our body, he says, "It is good."
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.520]   Humans, we're not souls trapped in flesh,
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.200]   but we're unified beings.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.640]   In Hebrew, there is a word called nefesh.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.280]   Like in Genesis two, I think it's verse seven,
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.520]   it says, "It's a living soul."
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.480]   God intended for our soul and our flesh
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.560]   to be united, to be one.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.560]   We are unified being, soul and flesh together.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.200]   But then our body was also corrupted
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.160]   by the fall of humanity, and we all know that.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.680]   And because of sin coming into the world
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.600]   through the fall of humanity, diseases, death,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.720]   and all the problems came into the world as well.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.720]   And we start to experience all the sickness, aging,
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.760]   yeah, aging and physical decay, and all chronic illness.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.440]   We experience like disability,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.680]   or experience our bodies get weaker and weaker as we age.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.880]   But that's not the original plan of God.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.360]   That's not his original design for us.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.120]   It's the consequences of a fractured world.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.520]   Human bodies are broken because of our sins,
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.880]   but human bodies were not evil in its nature.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.960]   Let me say that again.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.680]   Our bodies are broken because of our sin.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.160]   So we are experiencing sickness, aging, death,
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:49.380]   all these issues, but our bodies are not evil in nature.
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.760]   That's not how God sees it.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.240]   He's not here to destroy our body.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.960]   That's not how he sees.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.960]   And when Jesus came into the world, word became flesh.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:05.760]   He took on a bodily form.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.960]   He took on human flesh.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.840]   If human flesh is evil,
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.280]   Jesus would definitely not take on human flesh.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.600]   But word became flesh.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.720]   And when Jesus was ministering on earth,
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.320]   when he was walking around,
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.360]   he started manifesting the kingdom of God
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.440]   through one of his ministry called healing,
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.240]   restoring bodily or restoring physical health
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.400]   for individuals, for people.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.760]   That is to say, that is a sign to say,
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.880]   hey, you know what?
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.160]   You wanna know when the kingdom of God fully comes to earth?
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.480]   You wanna know how it looks?
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.420]   It looks like this.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.240]   This is a sign when sickness and disease
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.280]   and death was reverted.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.680]   When someone is healed,
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.600]   when he experienced physical shalom,
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.160]   that's the kingdom of God at hand.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.400]   And so Jesus was healing people
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.360]   as a sign for them to know that
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.280]   this is the ultimate reality that God has planned for us.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.240]   And not just that, when Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.520]   he didn't have a spiritual resurrection.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.160]   He had a bodily resurrection.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.640]   He even asked his disciples, hey, come touch me, touch me.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.440]   It's me in my body.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.400]   It's a bodily resurrection.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.280]   And we need to know this.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.680]   God is not rejecting our bodies.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.840]   He's not rejecting human bodies.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.600]   God's plan was never to reject them.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.760]   God's plan is to redeem our bodies.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.600]   Let me say that again.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.240]   God's plan is not to reject human bodies.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.040]   His plan is to redeem our bodies because he created them
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.720]   and he saw that was good.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.280]   And if our body, it's part of God's salvation plans,
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:51.040]   if it actually matters to God,
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.040]   then how we treat our bodies would actually matter as well.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.360]   Don't you agree?
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:03.160]   Since our bodies are not disposable or temporary shells
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.480]   but we're destined for redemption,
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.800]   how we treat our bodies today matters.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.240]   I'm going to talk about a few ways
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.680]   that we could treat our bodies
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.320]   or learn from the theology of our body
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.720]   that I just spent 15 minutes to unpack.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.480]   I'm going to share a few practical tips for us.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.200]   So number one, we should be honoring God
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.320]   with our bodies today.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.600]   That includes like pursuing purity.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.160]   You know, in 1 Corinthians 6, it says that your body,
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.040]   don't you know that your body is the temple
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.800]   of the Holy Spirit?
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.280]   Don't you know that, you know, in Romans 12 says this,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.600]   do you know that you should give God your body
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.280]   to honor him, to worship him?
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.880]   Didn't you know that we should honor God
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.960]   with our bodies today, pursue purity,
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.200]   get away from sexual immorality?
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.200]   That is something that hurts us deeply in our flesh
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:09.120]   and we should also care for our physical health
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.640]   and the sense of stewardship.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.360]   And we're not idolizing health.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.400]   I know there are like many things you can do about health
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.600]   and some people, they really,
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.400]   oh, I don't care how it's most important.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.960]   Maybe for some people, health or wellbeing,
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.400]   it's more important than God, but we're not doing that.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.000]   We're just trying to take good care of our bodies
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.520]   as good stewards of what God has given us,
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.800]   knowing that this is God's temple, he stays there.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.080]   And so we know we need to rest when we're tired.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.480]   Don't drink soft drinks, drink more water.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.640]   I learned that from Cristiano Ronaldo.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.560]   It's a good motto on that.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.080]   A good nutrition.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.240]   Yeah, these are the basic stuff,
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.320]   but these are the things people have forgotten,
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.120]   that we are treating our bodies so bad
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.000]   in a way that we are hurting our bodies.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.120]   We're saying, I don't care what happens to you
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.840]   as long as my soul goes to heaven.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.960]   No, we need to treat this.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.880]   We need to know that God is here to redeem our body.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.920]   And so we're not here to worship fitness,
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.440]   but we're here to honor the Holy Spirit who lives inside.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.440]   So we honor God with our bodies
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.480]   and we need to see physical suffering
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.120]   with hope and not despair.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:30.360]   Like I know sometimes we ourselves,
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.560]   we experience sickness or illness.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.120]   Or the painful fact that one day you find out like,
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.360]   oh, I'm aging.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.240]   I can see it on my forehead.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.880]   I can see it when I go to gym.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.040]   I can sense it.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.080]   I know my body is deteriorating.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.520]   And sometimes even sickness that we don't wanna face,
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.200]   some terminal illness.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.280]   One day you find out, oh, I've got this condition.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.040]   I know it's painful.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.400]   I know it's challenging.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.080]   I know it's not easy.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.040]   And sometimes they feel so real.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.880]   Or most of the time they feel very, very real.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.560]   I've had the experience.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.840]   I mean, I had family members who went through that.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.400]   I know what it does to not just the person,
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.240]   but the family around them.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.840]   But when we are going through physical suffering,
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.400]   we need to know they're not the end of the story.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.640]   No matter how loud they're speaking to us,
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.280]   that's not the end of our story here.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.480]   The world tries to tell us when you die, you die.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.680]   There's nothing else.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.880]   So you better do something,
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.160]   make people remember you, make memories.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.520]   These are not bad advice,
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.600]   but we also know that that's not the end of the story.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.600]   Death and cancer and diseases and a deterioration,
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.760]   they don't have the final word in our lives.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.040]   I know that even one day we close our eyes and we passed on,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   but the day when Jesus, on the day when he returns,
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.560]   I know that this body, this dead body,
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.280]   very dead body, maybe ash,
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.960]   I don't know where my body would be,
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.640]   but this body will experience resurrection,
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.840]   a bodily resurrection.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.320]   And I know that one day we're gonna stand somewhere,
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   I don't know where, but somewhere in a new bodily form.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.440]   Paul was describing, you know what?
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.600]   That old form, it's weak, but the new one is glorious.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.920]   This one is perishable,
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.320]   but what you're gonna get is imperishable.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.800]   Paul was trying to tell you, hey,
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.520]   that body that Jesus received, that resurrected body,
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.600]   that's the same body you're gonna get.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.720]   So whatever you're facing right now,
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.680]   maybe you're passing on from this life,
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.880]   but you have to know that that's not the end.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.320]   If you're thinking about life
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.760]   as though the day that the doctor gave you,
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.720]   the amount of time the doctor gave you
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.080]   is how much time you have, you need to think larger,
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.560]   you need to think eternity,
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.240]   you need to know that there is something else there.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.720]   You got a lot more time to spend when Jesus comes back.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.920]   There should be hope and not despair.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.520]   In Romans, Paul was saying like,
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.800]   we groan inwardly as we wait eagerly
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.680]   for the adoption of a sonship for that glory
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.680]   and the redemption of our bodies.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.880]   We are waiting patiently
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.400]   for that redemption of our bodies.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.200]   But in the same chapter, Paul was also describing,
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.480]   you know what, you guys are not just the only ones
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.240]   that is waiting for God's renewal.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.120]   In fact, the entire creation of God
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.840]   has been groaning with you.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.280]   They are also waiting for that day
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.120]   for God's glory to reveal,
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.880]   for the sons, for the children of God to reveal
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.320]   so that they would receive that renewal as well.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.360]   We preach a sermon on that,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.160]   on justice and creation last year.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.840]   You can go back to YouTube and check on it.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.400]   But here's the thing that, you know,
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.440]   we're not the only ones who are waiting
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.600]   for this renewal or resurrection.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.840]   God is going to renew us, resurrect us,
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.720]   but God is going to, on that day,
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.480]   he's going to renew his entire creation as well.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.960]   So if you're on God's team,
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.560]   what you should be thinking is,
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.840]   how am I gonna minister this renewal,
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.840]   this redemption of God's work over the entire creation,
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.360]   rather than, oh, you know what,
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.880]   this world is gonna end anyway.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.680]   Maybe someone will press a button
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.200]   and there will be a nuclear bomb,
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.960]   or you know, pollution, you know,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.840]   climate change, or this world is doomed,
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.440]   so I don't have to do anything,
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.080]   or I can just, you know, just do it the same way,
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.840]   continue to enjoy my life.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.920]   If you're really on God's side,
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.920]   if you take your place at his side,
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.680]   you know that his heart is to redeem,
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.440]   and his heart is to save that creation.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:07.440]   So if you take your place as the steward of God's family,
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.400]   we actually have a place,
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.920]   we actually have a role to play in his creation.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.520]   We are waiting for our own bodily resurrection,
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.520]   but we also have a role to play
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.080]   in the redemption of the creation.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:25.520]   And so you can respect your body,
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.080]   you can treat your body better,
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.200]   knowing that this is how you honor God.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.720]   You pursue purity, and you know that
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:37.720]   even when you're facing sickness, or death, or suffering,
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.000]   you know that you hold onto that hope
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.400]   that one day God is gonna come and make things right,
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.760]   but then also you need to know
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.600]   that you're not the only one waiting for that day.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:53.240]   The entire creation has been waiting with you.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.720]   And so what we can do is to find a place in it.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:03.600]   So in December, when I was in the car,
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.560]   when my daughter asked me that question,
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.200]   are we all gonna die?
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.040]   Like, I was just praying,
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.040]   and I felt like answering her question this way.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.720]   I said, yeah, you know what?
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.920]   As human beings, we all die.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.000]   We all leave this earth someday,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.400]   and we'll have to say goodbye, it's gonna be sad.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:32.280]   But that's actually one way of life, if you stick with it.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.200]   There's a person, if you stay with that person
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.080]   your entire life, if you try to build relationship
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.040]   with him every day, a deeper and deeper relationship,
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.640]   if you follow his ways, his name is Jesus,
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.480]   if you do that, if you dedicate your entire life to do that,
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:52.480]   one day when death comes, you'll actually be ready.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.640]   You'll not be afraid.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.360]   You'll know that, yeah, I know today is the day
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.680]   that I'm leaving this earth, that I'm passing on,
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.240]   but I'm not afraid.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.440]   There's no regret in me.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:12.160]   I can greet my creator, I can greet my savior
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.000]   with a grin on my face.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.780]   I'll tell him, yes, I've been waiting for you.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:21.320]   You are the one I've been longing to see my entire life,
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:26.240]   face to face, and I know one day when your time comes,
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.680]   when you come back to earth,
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.240]   I'll receive the resurrection of my body with you,
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:38.120]   and I'll continue to see all my loved ones face to face
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.680]   in a new body again.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.120]   That's the day I'm waiting for.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.840]   That's the day I'm preparing my family for,
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.140]   and that's the day God wants us as his family
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.160]   to get ready for.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.580]   If we know what's gonna happen the day when he's coming back,
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.960]   if we understand Jesus being the first fruit,
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.360]   if we understand what that means,
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.600]   a guarantee that we will all experience the same thing
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.960]   that he has experienced on Easter Sunday,
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.520]   on the feast of first fruits,
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.920]   that should affect how we're spending our everyday.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.120]   That should affect how we live our life.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.620]   Don't you agree, church?
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:21.000]   Why don't we spend some time to pray together now?
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.440]   Father, we come before you.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:37.880]   We thank you for the first fruits.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:44.640]   Father, we thank you that the resurrection of Jesus
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.560]   is indeed the first fruits,
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.040]   and when we look at that,
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.480]   when we look at his resurrection,
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.640]   we have the guarantee, we know for sure that one day
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.920]   that's exactly the same thing we will experience as well.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.380]   And so, Father, today we come before you.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:12.320]   I just feel like praying for some of us in the midst.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:19.920]   Maybe you're struggling with the fear of death,
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.740]   fear of a disease, fear of the weakness
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.520]   that you're experiencing in your body,
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.740]   fear of aging, perhaps.
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:41.160]   I wanna pray for you that today you know the truth,
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.480]   you know God's plan, and the truth will set you free
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.560]   from the fear you're experiencing.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:52.800]   That when you look at the first fruits,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   when you look at Jesus, you have the assurance
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.160]   that you will get a new body,
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.760]   you will experience the resurrection,
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.280]   and there's life after death.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:10.040]   Not just a spiritual, like, flowing and floating
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.120]   in the air kind of life, but you will get a new body,
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.160]   and you will be enjoying life in God's new creation.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.480]   There's real hope.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.060]   (gentle music)
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:31.080]   And you don't have to live according to your fears,
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.440]   you don't have to be driven
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:39.400]   by what you're afraid would happen in the end to you.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.240]   You know there is something else waiting for you.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.560]   Father, I pray you would come and set us free
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:57.420]   from the fear of death, from the fear of disease,
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:02.740]   from our illness, weakness,
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:07.840]   the fear of being old,
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:13.260]   that we know there's an eternity awaits for us.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.000]   (gentle music)
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.540]   Father, I pray that knowledge of your truth
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:25.060]   will transform our lives,
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.820]   will change the way we think,
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.980]   change the way we speak,
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.900]   will change our lifestyle,
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.460]   will change how we plan our days,
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.420]   how we plan our everyday schedule,
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:42.060]   change the way we spend time with friends and family,
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.020]   (gentle music)
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.420]   I pray that today you will put your eternity in our hearts.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.140]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.720]   (gentle music)
