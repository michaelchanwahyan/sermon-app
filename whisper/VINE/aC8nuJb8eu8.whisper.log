[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   Everyone says, amen, amen, amen.
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.840]   (congregation applauding)
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.800]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.600]   My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.800]   and if you're relatively new to the Vine,
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.200]   we're so glad you're with us.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.800]   We're in week two of a four-week series
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.800]   on the topic of personal transformation.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.400]   And this idea in scripture
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.840]   that one of the primary ministries of Jesus
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.240]   is to, through His Spirit and His truth,
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.000]   take us from the people that we are right now
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.840]   to the people that He longs for us to be,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440]   the people He's created us to be.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.040]   And we're basing this series in Ezra, the book of Ezra,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.240]   and specifically this moment of pivotal history
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.400]   for Israel's people,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.560]   where they've been taken out of their exile in Babylon,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.400]   the 70 years of exile in Babylon,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160]   and now released by Cyrus, the king of Persia,
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.700]   to go back to Jerusalem,
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.960]   and they're standing there in the book of Ezra
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.460]   in the rubble of Jerusalem,
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.400]   where Jerusalem, some 70 years before,
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.600]   had been this glorious city.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.100]   The Babylonians had come in, pulled down the wall,
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.240]   destroyed the temple, 70 years in exile.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840]   Now the Jewish people back standing
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.800]   in the rubble of the city they love.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.200]   And as they're standing in that rubble,
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.300]   they hear the taunts of the enemies around them.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.060]   And those taunts say, "Can you see the rubble around you?
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.700]   "Can you see how burnt out the stones are?
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.600]   "Can you see what was once glorious
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.460]   "now lies in ruin around you?
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.460]   "Can life ever come back to these burnt out stones?"
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.600]   And we said last week that for Israel, so for us,
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.840]   that there's things that lie in ruin in us,
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.800]   rubble that we're aware of in our own lives.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.860]   Perhaps something that's happened to us in the past,
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.840]   something that we're not proud of.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.100]   Perhaps the mistakes we've made,
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.160]   or maybe mistakes others made to us.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.960]   Trauma that's embedded, hurt and shame, failure, pain,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.860]   whatever it might be.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.660]   But I think all of us can recognize
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.740]   that there's some things in our lives that lie in ruin.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.960]   Rubble that we're asking ourselves,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.640]   can anything good ever come from this?
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.460]   That we wrestle, don't we, with sometimes recognizing
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.760]   that we're not the people that we wanna be.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.860]   And we think, you know what?
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.500]   I can never be the person that I wanna be.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.960]   I can never be the person God wants me to be.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.440]   'Cause I've got this rubble and this ruin.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.880]   And have you seen it?
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.720]   And if you could see it,
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.280]   you'd know that nothing good could ever come from this.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.040]   And what we saw last week in Ezra chapter three
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.180]   is this beautiful moment where the builders
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.180]   bring out the first stones to begin to rebuild the temple
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.980]   that had been destroyed some 70 years before.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.940]   And as they bring it out,
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.580]   there's this sense of that question hanging over Israel.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.340]   Are you going to agree with the taunts of the enemy,
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.080]   see the rubble around you and think nothing good
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.380]   could ever come from it?
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.980]   Or are you gonna get a new mindset?
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.980]   And then recognize that there is that rubble,
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.580]   but believe that in the power and in the mercy of God,
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.180]   the rain that falls by the Holy Spirit,
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.680]   what was rubble in this moment
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.040]   can become a new building in the next.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.680]   And last week, I shared with you some ways
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.720]   in which I think God begins this process
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.320]   of personal transformation in our lives
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.220]   and those areas that we recognize have that ruin
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.780]   and that rubble.
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.540]   I wanted to summarize four things specifically
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.040]   that we talked about last week,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.940]   just to help you get a sense of where we are in this series.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.940]   And then we're gonna go from there.
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.040]   Here's the first thing we learned last week.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.780]   Any process of personal transformation doesn't begin
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.580]   until we take an honest and sober look
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.280]   at the rubble that exists in our lives.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.280]   We must understand and own what needs to change within us.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.340]   No one has ever changed or transformed
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.000]   without first saying there's something inside of me
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.400]   that needs to change.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.300]   And it's a sober thing to recognize
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.900]   that there is rubble and ruin,
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.140]   not to try to hide it,
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.300]   not to try to pretend it's not there,
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.880]   but to say, Lord, I recognize it
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.040]   and I know I can't do anything about it,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.200]   but Lord, I bring it to you.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.300]   We saw last week, number two,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.200]   that God's work of renewal begins in the rubble.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.640]   It's the very place where he does his best work.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.480]   He doesn't remove our rubble.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.600]   He restores it.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.000]   The beautiful thing that we saw last week
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.400]   is that those first kind of stones
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.040]   that were laid by the builders
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.240]   were out of that burnt out rubble
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.580]   where people thought nothing good could ever come of that.
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.300]   That becomes the stone the builders rejected,
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.140]   becomes the cornerstone.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.740]   The things in our lives that we think,
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.540]   oh man, if only I could just get rid
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.300]   of all of that gunk and stuff.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.940]   That's the stuff that God's playground.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.740]   He looks at that stuff in your life.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.340]   He rolls up his sleeves and says,
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.040]   come on, we're gonna do something
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.740]   with what you thought could never be transformed or renewed.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.780]   Thirdly, we saw this last week.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.600]   As Christians, worship must begin a process
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.900]   of transformation, not just complete it.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.140]   When we are in the rubble,
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.780]   our worship should focus on the character of God
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.200]   over the circumstance of the world.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.840]   We often worship as a response,
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.600]   worship out of the overflow
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.840]   or the outcome of something God's done.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.100]   God's answered that prayer.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.140]   He's come through for me.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.340]   He's done that miracle.
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.040]   Out of that, I find worship.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.300]   And that's absolutely right.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.300]   We should worship out of outcome.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.200]   But what we see in Ezra chapter three
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.080]   is that the Jewish people, the Israelites,
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.740]   began worship long before they saw an outcome.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.000]   They lay the foundations of the stone
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.600]   through this act of worship, giving praise and glory,
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.340]   not because of what they can see with their eyes,
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.880]   not because of some thing
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.140]   that they're expecting God to do in the future.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.580]   They praise for the character of God
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.180]   over the circumstance they find themselves in.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.900]   And every move of personal transformation in your life
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.980]   will happen as we shift towards this worship
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.300]   of his character over our circumstance.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.500]   Not an easy thing to do,
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.580]   but something glorious when we do it.
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.940]   And here's the fourth thing.
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.380]   We said this, we must understand
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.440]   that God's renewal takes time.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.600]   It is a journey of many small, obedient decisions
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.740]   within a much larger framework
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.540]   of God's purposes in our lives.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.200]   We would love a magic wand to be waved
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.300]   and suddenly that trauma goes, but the reality is
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.600]   so often it's those small little steps
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.080]   that we take each day when we stay obedient
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.180]   to the thing that God's called us in our lives,
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.700]   that God shapes a masterpiece over time.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.180]   Some of the most important things
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.740]   that God will ever do in your life,
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.080]   it's gonna take some time.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.480]   And sometimes opening ourselves up
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.000]   to the journey of that process
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.500]   is primary in the season of transformation in our lives.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.700]   So that was last week.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.680]   If you weren't here last week,
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.180]   you can jump back online, you can hear it,
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.800]   or you can just take a photo of that slide and go,
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.140]   I've got it, all right?
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.240]   So last week we focused on this idea
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.140]   that personal transformation begins with this.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.840]   Today, I wanna talk about, as we continue this passage,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.440]   I wanna talk about the environment
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.740]   by which personal transformation truly happens
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.980]   and how we here at the Vine might be able
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.400]   to create that kind of environment together.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.780]   And to tell you about that, I wanna share a quick story.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.480]   In my early 20s, I worked for a recruitment company.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.880]   It was a headhunting firm,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.640]   an international headhunting company
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.640]   that had offices in New York, in Hong Kong, and in Tokyo.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.480]   And it just so happened that when I was about 23 years old,
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.200]   most of my clients, most of my candidates
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.840]   were based in Tokyo.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.100]   So every eight weeks, I would have a business trip
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.540]   up to Tokyo, and for Monday to Friday,
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.740]   I would be in the Tokyo office,
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.280]   and I'd be meeting with my clients,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.480]   meeting with my candidates and doing all that.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.540]   Then I'd come back to Hong Kong.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.800]   But on this one particular trip,
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.300]   the company up in Japan asked me to stay for two weeks,
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.980]   which meant that I was gonna, for the first time,
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.780]   stay over the weekend in Tokyo.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.580]   And I had come to Christ about three years prior to this.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.700]   So I came to Jesus at university
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.580]   when I was in my early 20s.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.480]   Now I'm 23, I'm in Tokyo, I'm staying over the weekend.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.980]   And I decided I wanted to go and visit a church,
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.680]   not knowing anything really about the Christian context
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.180]   in Japan or about churches in general.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.340]   And you also have to remember,
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.640]   I'm kind of dating myself here,
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.340]   but this was quite a while ago, okay, when I was 23.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.380]   So the interwebs was not quite the thing that it is today.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.200]   It existed, okay, we used it,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.600]   but there was no Google Maps,
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.200]   there was no kind of stuff like that,
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.780]   none of that existed yet.
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.240]   So I did the smart thing,
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.680]   I turned to my Japanese colleague in the office,
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.380]   and I said, "Hey, would you make some phone calls for me
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.540]   "and find out if there's a church near where I'm staying?"
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.840]   And he's like, "Oh, I'm just on, I'm just on, okay, okay."
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.340]   So he makes some phone calls across the day,
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.400]   and at the end of the day, he comes to me,
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.500]   he's like, "Oh, Andrew-san," he goes,
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.000]   "I find a church for you."
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.080]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's great."
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.500]   He's like, "It's only a 10-minute walk
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.000]   "from your hotel where you're staying, fantastic."
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.900]   He says, "It's on the 14th floor of this industrial building,"
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.980]   and he gave me the details, he wrote it all out for me.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.200]   So sure enough, on the Sunday,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.340]   I think the service started at like 9.30 or 10,
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.800]   I can't fully remember, but I was there on time,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.340]   got in the lift, I went up,
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.780]   the doors of the lift opened on the 14th floor,
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.480]   and I looked at what was in front of me,
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.140]   and I immediately began to think,
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.580]   I might need to fire my colleague.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.240]   In front of me was this old Japanese lady, beautiful lady,
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.400]   probably in her late 70s, early 80s,
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.500]   wearing a very formal Japanese outfit,
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.680]   hunched a little bit because of her age.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.580]   When she saw the doors open, her eyes just lit up.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.200]   She was so excited.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.700]   She's like, "A foreigner has come to our church.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.940]   Like revival is breaking out."
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.280]   And she gives me like this little brochure
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.880]   that was all in Japanese.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.900]   She opens this door and leads me into this room.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.840]   I go into this room,
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.380]   there's probably about 50 chairs in this room,
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.200]   a small kind of room, about 50 chairs.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.300]   There's about 15 people standing in the room.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.140]   As I come in, all 15 people turn around,
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.100]   and I immediately realized that the youngest person
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.440]   in that room other than me was probably about 78.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.880]   And they were all super like conservative,
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.100]   old Japanese people.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.500]   And they all stared at me with eyes lit up,
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.640]   just like the lady at the entrance,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.740]   and they all rushed over me.
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.200]   And it was that awkward moment,
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.700]   when you're not Japanese, you don't know what to do.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.180]   It's like, do you bow?
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.500]   They're all bowing.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.040]   They're all welcoming me.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.640]   They're speaking Japanese.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.040]   I don't speak Japanese.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.280]   They obviously don't speak much English.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.840]   Super awkward, but everybody's being super friendly,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.200]   super nice, and I'm like, okay, I guess I'll go.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.040]   I can't leave now.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.680]   Like, that would be the worst thing ever.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.500]   See you guys.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.140]   Like, nice to, you know.
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.880]   So I'm like, I'm stuck.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.280]   Anyway, this guy, probably about 82, 83,
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.440]   he grabbed me and he pulled me down the aisle.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.640]   He stood next to me.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.580]   He's like, oh, oh, oh, oh, you know, like this.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.680]   And then worship started.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.900]   Now, when worship started, half of the congregation
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.600]   got up on stage, 'cause they were the worship team, right?
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.060]   So there was like six of us left, six on the stage.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.640]   They had like keyboardists and drummers
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.000]   and guitarists and singers.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.560]   Over the next 15 minutes,
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.400]   it's hard to describe to you that experience,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.200]   but I would say it like this.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   It was very easily the worst worship
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.440]   I have ever heard in my life.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.540]   Like, not just 23, but now that I'm 50, okay?
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:25.100]   The worst, the guitar player, he gets so old,
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.000]   he could barely fret a chord, okay?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.640]   The pianist, I think, was deaf
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.000]   because they were pounding the keys as hard as they could.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.440]   The drummer must have probably been able to drum
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   50 years ago, but right now,
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.100]   he could not find a rhythm at all.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.040]   And I realized every single person had decided
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.140]   that they had a song they wanted to bring to worship,
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.500]   but none of them have talked to each other about it,
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.580]   and they're all just playing whatever they want to play.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.800]   And I haven't even told you yet about the singers.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.900]   They were terrible, like so bad,
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.080]   like couldn't hold a tune, couldn't do anything.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.200]   And I'm standing there thinking,
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.740]   this is the worst thing I've ever heard.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.740]   And I turned to the guy next to me,
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.540]   and I'm about to go like, (imitates drumming)
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.880]   like this, and he's like, he's like lost like 30 years.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.840]   He's jumping up in the air.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.140]   His arms are pumped up in the air.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.180]   And I'm thinking, what is going on?
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.280]   For me, this is the kind of worship
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.140]   that makes Jesus not want to come back to the world.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.720]   It's the kind of worship that keeps Jesus away.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.680]   I don't want to be anywhere near those humans.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.980]   But this guy's going like crazy,
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.740]   and he's shouting something.
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.580]   Here's what he's shouting.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.540]   He's going, he's saying,
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.540]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.040]   He turns to me, he grabs me by the arms.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.940]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.280]   He looked like really angry, like (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.580]   I'm thinking maybe, I have no idea what (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.980]   but I'm thinking maybe it's the name
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.300]   of the actual worship pastor who was sick
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.840]   and didn't show up that day.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.680]   And he's like, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.980]   I'm like, yes, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.380]   I wish he was here too.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.500]   But he's screaming.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.240]   And the reason why I remember (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.500]   is 'cause he said it like 100 times, top of his lung,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.740]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.180]   Monday morning, I'm back at the office,
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.880]   and I find my colleague.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.340]   And after slapping him around a little bit,
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.440]   I said to him, I said, can you define a word for me?
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.300]   I heard at this church this word, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.580]   What does (speaking in foreign language) mean?
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.840]   And he's like, oh, this is interesting.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.300]   This is not a standard Japanese word.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.440]   It's not a word that I know,
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.580]   but it's a conjoint of lots of things coming.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.880]   He starts to explain all this stuff.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.900]   And he's like, it's like lots of different ideas
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.540]   brought down into this one word.
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.100]   And I'm like, okay, well, what are the ideas?
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.900]   And he said, well, there's a shaking, a tearing,
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.940]   and then there's like the sky.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.940]   So I said, you mean it's like a shaking the sky?
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.300]   He's like, yes, yes, but also like tearing,
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.380]   wanting to tear the sky.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.180]   And I'm like, well, could it be like heaven?
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.640]   Like tear the heavens, shake the heavens.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.080]   He's like, yes, yes, yes, like shake the heavens.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.380]   It's funny, isn't it?
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.240]   How you can have, two people,
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.100]   can have exactly the same experience,
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.880]   but have completely different reactions
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.700]   and perspectives of it.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.280]   I show up in this church with my baggage of worship
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.700]   that I had, which was the vines worship.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.700]   Oh, yeah, great musicians, perfect sound,
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.280]   everybody in tune actually playing the same song,
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.240]   singing in tune, the beautiful sense
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.440]   of God's presence among, I mean, this was me.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.780]   That's what constituted good worship, are you with me?
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.540]   So I walk into that room knowing the baggage,
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.900]   having the history of that kind of worship,
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.940]   and I'm experiencing what I'm experiencing.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.940]   And I'm thinking, this is not worship at all,
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.240]   but the Japanese man next to me,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.700]   who maybe has never heard any other kind of worship
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.180]   than what was happening in that room.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.300]   Maybe that church always, that's just been the way it is.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.700]   It's a bit of a free for all, but he's standing there
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.080]   and he's like, I'm not here to hear skillful musicians.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.940]   I'm here to praise the one that saved me.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.180]   And I'm gonna stand here and go,
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.340]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.400]   rape open the heavens, Lord, bring your glory to this earth.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.080]   And I don't care what the musicians are doing
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.300]   and how it sounds, it's about my heart and honoring the one,
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.680]   even if we're not honoring him with the skills.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.880]   Rip open, shake open the heavens.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.280]   I, I wanted to run away.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.940]   That church, we're running in.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.880]   I wanted to weep.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.400]   They wanted to worship.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.000]   And as we get back to this moment
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.780]   that Ezra's describing for us in chapter three,
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.180]   as this incredible thing's happening
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.900]   with the rebuilding of the temple,
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:03.380]   almost exactly the same thing happens here.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.540]   And as we begin to unpack the reality
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.240]   of what is happening in these moments,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.800]   I think we can see something quite profound
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.540]   that might help to shape our personal growth in moment two.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.980]   Let me read this to you from Ezra three,
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.800]   picking up from where we read last week.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.400]   When the builders laid the foundation
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.840]   of the temple of the Lord, the priests in their vestments
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.440]   and with trumpets and the Levites,
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.480]   the sons of Asper and the symbols,
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.800]   took their places to praise the Lord
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.380]   as prescribed by David, King of Israel.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.300]   With praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.040]   He is good, his love endures forever.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.880]   And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.100]   because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.080]   Now listen to this.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.840]   But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.000]   who had seen the former temple wept aloud
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.440]   when they saw the foundations of this temple being laid.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.240]   While many others shouted for joy.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.040]   No one could distinguish the sounds of the shouts of joy
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.600]   from the sound of weeping
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.140]   because the people made so much noise.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.440]   Fathers, we open this up for each person here.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.840]   I pray that Lord, you would do something profound for us
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.040]   as we honour the reality of every person's story.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.800]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.500]   One group of people, two very different reactions.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.000]   The whole group seeing the same thing.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.280]   They see the rubble of Jerusalem lying around them.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.180]   They see the stones being brought in to be laid in the temple.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:36.280]   Everybody seeing the same thing, two very different reactions.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.480]   On the one side, there are these older people.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.700]   Now, actually Ezra tells us something really important
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.540]   in the text.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.000]   He says, they're so old.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.940]   He doesn't quite say it that way,
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.240]   but that's my way of saying it.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.040]   They're so old that they actually had seen the former temple.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.140]   Now, remember the history here.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.240]   They were in exile for 70 years.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.440]   So anybody returning back to Jerusalem
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.980]   who was over the age of about 74,
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.200]   in their early 80s into their 90s,
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.080]   they would have seen the former temple.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.380]   Not only that, but they probably would have worshipped
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.600]   in the former temple.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.840]   And they would have seen this glorious temple.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.280]   There's an image here coming up behind me,
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.280]   which is just this beautiful artist rendition
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.200]   from the Bible Society of what that temple
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.800]   would have looked like.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.300]   It was one of the most glorious architectural wonders
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.380]   of that ancient world.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.200]   And these people, these older Israelites,
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.440]   Levites and priests and family heads,
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.340]   had with their own eyes seen the glory of that temple.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.940]   Not only that, but they would have experienced
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.840]   the power of God's presence within it.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.580]   Now, I wanna just give you a sense
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.640]   of what the power of that presence was like
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.240]   by reading you the short passage
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.900]   about the dedication of the first temple.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.180]   Now, this was years, years before.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.500]   Obviously, none of these people were there for that moment.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.000]   But this is the moment where Solomon
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.100]   dedicates the temple, that temple you're seeing
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:54.980]   on the screen.
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.780]   This is 2 Chronicles 7, verses one to three.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.340]   "When Solomon finished praying,
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.040]   "fire came down from heaven
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.700]   "and consumed the burnt offering and sacrifices,
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.500]   "and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.500]   "The priest could not enter the temple of the Lord
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.880]   "because the glory of the Lord filled it.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.880]   "When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.500]   "and the glory of the Lord above the temple,
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.740]   "they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.480]   "and they worshipped and gave thanks to the Lord,
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.080]   "saying, 'He is good, His love endures forever.'"
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.580]   So here's the interesting thing.
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.780]   The older Levites and priests now in Ezra's time,
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.180]   obviously, they weren't there in that moment
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.640]   of the first dedication of the temple.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.940]   But 'cause they're the Levites and the priests,
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.940]   they know the story, they know exactly what's happened,
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.100]   they know what was happening,
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.500]   and they're now standing in the rubble of that temple
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.600]   and they're weeping.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.040]   And they're weeping because guess what?
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.780]   The people of Israel are singing the same song,
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.000]   but it's not having the same result.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.440]   Notice in the Ezra passage,
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.540]   Ezra said that the people sing the same thing.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.100]   "He is good, His love endures forever."
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.640]   And these older ones who know that that was sung
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.040]   when the first temple was laid,
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.540]   they're looking at this second temple
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.780]   and they're like, "Are we crazy?
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.400]   "Can you not see the rubble that's around us?
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.780]   "I remember what it used to look like.
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.600]   "I remember in my mind the glory of this temple.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.440]   "I felt the power of the presence of God
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.680]   "who filled that temple up until the moment
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.600]   "that the Babylonians tore it down.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.600]   "And now we're standing here and you're going,
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.140]   "'Woo-hoo, He is good.'"
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.280]   And they're thinking, "No, everything is lost.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.880]   "It's all gone.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.480]   "This is not good.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.480]   "We saw it before, we knew how great it was,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.940]   "but right here, it isn't great anymore."
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.180]   They're weeping for what they have lost.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.880]   They're weeping, not looking forward and going,
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.240]   "Hey, here's what God's about to do."
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.940]   They're weeping 'cause all they can think about
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.000]   is what they've lost.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.400]   They're not in a situation where they're thinking
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.780]   about what they're about to gain.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.480]   They're weeping because of just all the things
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.800]   that they've already lost.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.680]   I wonder if that resonates with any of you here.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.540]   I know it does for me.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.780]   I know it's quite easy to think that my best years
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.140]   of my life are already in the rear view mirror.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.880]   Like those moments back in the old days.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.780]   Some people in my generation and above,
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.280]   we have this phrase, if you're young here,
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.340]   it will annoy you, I'm sure.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.640]   And you've heard it many times.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.200]   Oh, in our day.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.840]   Well, if only you'd been in my time.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.400]   In our day, there was no social media.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.780]   People actually talked to each other.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.400]   It was great.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.540]   We actually had community in my day,
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.640]   you know, whatever it might be.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.340]   Like we know what it's like, isn't it?
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.800]   To look back on the past with rose tinted spectacles.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.880]   To look back and go, oh man, I remember those days.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.740]   Oh, that was great.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.280]   It's not so great anymore, but it was awesome back there.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.140]   We do this not just in terms of history and experience.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.780]   We do this in terms of relationships.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.740]   How many of us here might be honest and say,
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.980]   man, I wish my husband would be like he was
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.240]   when we first got married.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.040]   I wish my relationship was as romantic
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.880]   as it was when we first started dating.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.480]   Now it feels like my spouse doesn't even look at me.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.740]   As humans, we have this tendency
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.920]   to always look back on the things in the past
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.020]   with these rose colored glasses,
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.680]   kind of being selective about what we remember
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.140]   and trying to pull that to kind of say something
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.320]   about what it is today.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.240]   But when you look back and all your focus is back
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.440]   to the glory of something in the past,
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.520]   here's what happens.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.620]   You become blind to the importance
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.840]   of your presence in future.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.040]   You just get consumed by all this stuff over here
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.120]   and it stops you from actually moving forward.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.120]   See, in seasons of personal transformation,
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.940]   it's tempting to idolize the past,
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.740]   demonize the presence and fear the future.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.520]   It's really tempting for us to do that.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.240]   And this is, I think, what the older Israelites
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   and the priests are in danger of doing in this moment.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.840]   They're idolizing the past.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.420]   Oh man, if you had seen that previous temple,
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.540]   if you had seen the power that was there,
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.480]   oh, and you think this is good, you're worshiping to this?
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.380]   It's like me in that church in Japan.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.080]   Really, you guys, you're worshiping to this?
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.840]   And there's this moment, isn't there,
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.280]   where we bring the baggage and we say,
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.980]   well, if it's not like it was back then,
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.280]   well, it can't be any good.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.520]   And the priests and the Levites,
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   they're in danger in this moment of weeping
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.240]   from completely missing the new thing God wants to do.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.920]   And they're so connected back to the pain
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.180]   of what they've lost that they can't even see
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.020]   what they're about to gain.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.220]   Not only that, but I think they're also in danger
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.440]   of wanting to stop the others from building.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.440]   Like, there's no point even trying.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.480]   We can't get back.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.740]   That was the glorious moment.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.680]   That was the great temple.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.480]   Look, just put your tools down.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.880]   There's no spirit here.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.320]   There's no power here.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.380]   Let's just give up.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.480]   We're just singing words without anything.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.960]   They're in danger of allowing the missing
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.220]   of the thing in the past to actually begin to say,
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.680]   we're not even gonna bother to move forward
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.520]   with the present.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:20.020]   See, when you allow the grief of your past
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.860]   to continue to speak louder to you
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.460]   than the hope of your future,
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.980]   you are always going to end up in a situation
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.960]   where you're likely to resist and to not embrace
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.820]   the very transformation that God wants to do in your life.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.460]   And in this moment, I think this is where
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.660]   these older people are, two feet here,
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:46.660]   and God's here saying, watch what I'm about to do.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.760]   But we can actually resist the transformation
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.420]   God wants to bring us.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.860]   If we're trying to get ourselves back
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.460]   to an old version of ourselves.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.520]   The Hebrew word for restoration in scripture
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.820]   is not go back.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.760]   You know, like you think about it with a car.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.860]   What is it like to restore an old car?
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.160]   The idea is to make it look as good as it did originally.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.620]   That's not the Hebrew word.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.460]   Restoration in scripture is not about trying to get you back
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.520]   to the perfect image of the thing in the past.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.820]   It's actually about taking you forward to the new thing.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.760]   Paul would say, anybody who is in Christ Jesus is what?
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.920]   A new creation.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.520]   The old is gone, the new has come.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.620]   But here's the older people in Israel,
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.420]   and they're weeping for what has been lost
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.220]   when God's saying, can't you see what you're about to gain?
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.980]   Now, stay with me for a second,
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.980]   because I'm not saying that weeping is wrong.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.780]   I'm not saying that mourning is bad,
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.460]   that we shouldn't feel emotions and hurt and pain,
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.680]   and we shouldn't process that.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.880]   In fact, it's completely the opposite of that.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.220]   Scripture has so much to say about the wonder
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.860]   of what it is for us humans to feel and have emotion
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.680]   and to know pain and to know trauma,
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.820]   and to have to try to process it.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.220]   Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.480]   Matthew 5, 4 says to everybody around him,
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.420]   he said, "Blessed are those who mourn,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.580]   for they will be comforted."
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.120]   In other words, it's okay to have pain.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.060]   It's okay to look back and go,
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.460]   man, that was something great there that I've lost.
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:17.760]   It's all right to feel the disappointment and the hurt.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.320]   In fact, the Christian religion
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.720]   is one of the most beautiful religions,
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.460]   because rather than trying to simply explain our suffering,
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.180]   the Christian religion has a God
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.320]   who joins us in that suffering.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.460]   That's a radical thing.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.600]   There's no other religion,
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.160]   there's no other faith in the world where that happens,
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.460]   where God will come and be a part of the pain
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.160]   and the suffering of this world.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.460]   Jesus himself weeps out loud bitterly
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.860]   when his best friend, Lazarus, dies.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.560]   He feels the pain and he doesn't try to hide it,
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.200]   even though he knows he's about to bring him back to life.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.460]   Get your head around that one for a moment.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.900]   He weeps in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.100]   knowing the weight of what it's going to be
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.360]   to take the sin of the world on his shoulders
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.560]   and a desperate cry before his father
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.960]   if there's any other way.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.620]   And he weeps and weeps in that moment.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.100]   And yet he knows that the Lord, his father,
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.660]   is still going to be glorified.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.920]   He knows the victory is there,
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.000]   but he still finds a place to weep.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.620]   This is the beautiful thing about our faith.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:24.020]   In Jesus, we do not just have a God of the sufferers,
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.220]   we have a God who suffers.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.220]   Come on, church.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.920]   That's a profound thought.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:36.860]   That means that in my suffering, in my pain, in my hurt,
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.420]   in the things that I'm holding in my spirit,
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.760]   I've got a God who understands that.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.520]   I've got a God who's not sitting on a cloud going,
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.820]   oh yeah, yeah, you suffer, that must be hard.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.500]   I've got a God who's walked in my shoes,
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.600]   knows that pain, felt it himself,
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.760]   worse than I will ever find it.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.800]   And so I have somebody to turn to
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.560]   who understands what's going on in my life
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.760]   and can meet me in the reality of the pain
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.000]   and the brokenness that I feel that liberates me to mourn,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.920]   that allows me to bring my grief.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.720]   This is why we have the lament Psalms in the Psalms.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   It's why we have these beautiful poems
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.700]   where God's people say, why have you forsaken me?
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.920]   Where are you, God?
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.060]   Why have you left me?
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.000]   Why have you gone?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.560]   And we begin to have these beautiful expressions.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.760]   And if I was writing the Bible and putting it together,
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.000]   I would have taken those things and left them out.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.860]   Like, oh, that's a bit harsh.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.360]   You can't speak to God that way.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.020]   Let's just put that one aside.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.760]   No, no, they're in the scriptures to give us permission
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.420]   to bring our big feelings to God,
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.000]   to not bury them under the ground or try to push them away
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.360]   or pretend that they're not there.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.320]   We have a God who's joined us in our suffering.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.960]   Our suffering always has a place with him.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.660]   I don't need to run from it.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.120]   I don't need to hide from it.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.500]   Equally though, I don't need to let it overwhelm me
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.920]   to the point where I can no longer see
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.720]   what God's doing in the midst of it.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.500]   - Yeah.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.420]   - You see, when we weep before God, here's what we do.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:06.360]   We acknowledge our humanity and his divinity.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.000]   We proclaim through our tears, faith and trust
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.660]   that he alone is able to comfort and heal.
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.500]   That's the wonder of what it is to weep.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.800]   That's the beauty of what it is to offer it.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.460]   And in this moment, yes, I do think that they're weeping
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.220]   because of what they feel they've lost.
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.960]   But I think there's a bigger point
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.500]   to their weeping in this moment.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.120]   They're weeping because they realize
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.160]   that they are aligning themselves to the pain
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.660]   that is on the father's heart.
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.120]   You see, they're weeping for what I would argue
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.660]   is something called godly sorrow.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.960]   Got to remember the history again.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.200]   For 70 years, they're in exile.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.560]   And during that time, they're reflecting
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.420]   and they're thinking about what happened.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.620]   And they're asking one critical question.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.460]   Why did the walls come down around Jerusalem?
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.420]   Why did the temple get destroyed?
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.620]   And the prophets and the artisans
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.620]   and the writers of the Psalms in that time, Psalm 131,
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.820]   "By the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.520]   when we remembered Zion."
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.520]   Their writers and their poets and their artists
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.560]   helped them to understand that the reason
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.100]   why they're in exile is not because God's abandoned them,
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.900]   not because God's turned his back on them,
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.360]   which is what they thought originally.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   But as they process it, think about it,
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.860]   spiritually God speaks in them,
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.520]   they realize they're in that place because of their choices.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.460]   And the prophets begin to say, "Idolatry and injustice."
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.020]   Idolatry in terms of how they were sharing their heart
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.200]   no longer with Yahweh, but with other gods and deities.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.160]   Injustice where through that, they were treating themselves
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.860]   and others around them poorly and wrongly.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.060]   And because idolatry and injustice
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.420]   was so ripe in their midst, God brings the actions,
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.200]   the consequences to their sinful choices.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.660]   And I think what's happening here for the older priests,
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.300]   as they're standing in the rubble, they're weeping,
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.760]   not just because they feel like they've lost something,
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:09.760]   they're weeping because they realize this is our fault.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:15.920]   We did this, us.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.300]   And I think there's something happening in their hearts
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.600]   that is aligning them to the heart of God.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.400]   They're beginning to see sin the way that God sees it,
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.160]   and they're beginning to bring these tears of repentance.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.200]   These beautiful, this is not the kind of tears of like,
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.460]   "Oh my gosh, I'm so bad, I've screwed up,
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.260]   I'm such a terrible person."
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.960]   This is like, I see finally what God sees about brokenness
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.460]   and idolatry and injustice, and it is not right.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.320]   And it breaks my heart like it breaks God's heart.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.960]   And it breaks me even more
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.800]   'cause I realized I was the one that did this.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.220]   And Lord, I weep because as I look at the rubble,
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.060]   I know that we brought the walls down.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:03.760]   And this profound sense of godly sorrow,
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   not to beat myself up 'cause I'm the worst in the world,
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:11.660]   but a beautiful recognition that I finally agree with God,
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.300]   and I know that he can liberate me,
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.460]   that he can forgive me and give me grace and mercy,
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.300]   brings me to tears.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.960]   Some of you here, it's really important you hear this.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.600]   Some of you here, your own journey
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.100]   and personal transformation will not begin
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.600]   until you actually have the courage to agree
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.520]   with how God sees sin and really, truly grieve
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.460]   its persistent presence in your life.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:42.260]   I know it's not an easy word, but that's truth.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.560]   Some of us, until we actually find ourselves
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.120]   like those Levites and the priests, man,
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.260]   I'm so sorry, Lord.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:56.720]   I'm finally admitting and owning that this happened.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.960]   And Lord, I come to you because I have the courage
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.700]   to agree with you and how I see myself.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.620]   I'm sorry, Lord.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:08.060]   But I'm not just sorry as in like, oh, I'm the worst.
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.220]   I'm sorry because I know I don't deserve it.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.800]   I don't understand it, but there is grace
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.500]   and there is mercy in you and you forgive me.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.020]   And when I know that I don't deserve your forgiveness,
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.100]   but you give it to me, it makes the tears come more.
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:28.260]   And there's this beautiful moment
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.360]   where these people are weeping,
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.460]   maybe for the first time and saying,
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.860]   Lord, would you forgive us?
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:42.100]   I love how the fact that Ezra takes that moment
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.200]   and he tells us that right alongside of it,
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.700]   there's a whole bunch of young people praising Jesus,
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.600]   praising the Lord, so excited about what's happening.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.720]   Both of these things are right in the same moment.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.520]   It was right for the older people to go,
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.660]   oh man, I've lost something.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.520]   Oh man, we've done something.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.920]   Lord, we're sorry.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.560]   But it was also right for the young ones to stand around
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.220]   and go, isn't he good?
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.220]   Isn't he great?
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.160]   He is good.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.960]   His love does endure forever
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.520]   'cause he's about to start a new process within us.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.960]   This starting point of weeping
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.020]   is the beginning point of praising.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.100]   As we bring weeping and worshiping side by side,
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.920]   something truly transformative
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.360]   begins to happen in our lives.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.060]   We truly begin to become the people
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.820]   that God has always called us to be.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.820]   This is the very soundtrack to what change is in our lives.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.460]   It's not, we often think that personal transformation
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.860]   is linear, I'm just gonna have a season of weeping,
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.800]   weeping, weeping, weeping,
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.100]   and then boom, I'm in eternity of praise.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.720]   The human experience isn't that way.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.720]   Our human experience is weeping and worship side by side.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.500]   Days where we feel great, days where we're struggling.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:51.820]   Maybe even in the same day, moments of joy
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:55.600]   coupled with moments of grief.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.960]   And what we're seeing in this passage
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.000]   is when we allow that to happen,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.800]   when we don't shy away from it,
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.300]   when we don't try to bury it,
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.860]   when we bring worship and weeping mingled together,
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.000]   something profound happens.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.500]   And the greatest moments of personal transformation happen
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.520]   when those two things are allowed to exist
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.320]   in our lives together.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:23.300]   Some of your greatest joys can only be formed
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.900]   out of your deepest pain.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.720]   Come on, church.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.160]   Some of your greatest joys can only be found,
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.820]   forged in you out of your deepest pain.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.520]   When I was 32 years old,
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.720]   I received the diagnosis of azuspermia,
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.220]   which means that I am unable
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.240]   to father children biologically.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.720]   And this was at the end of an eight-year journey
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.820]   when my wife and I were trying to have biological family,
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.880]   all the dreams that we had in our heart for children.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.280]   I've told this story many times,
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.540]   but that was my deepest pain.
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.620]   I began to second guess who I was as a man.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.520]   I began to second guess who I was as a husband.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.580]   I really struggled with not liking God in that moment,
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.940]   feeling like, why did he create me with a desire
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.340]   to have a family and then make me physically unable
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.480]   to do it?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.240]   Like, is God some joker up in heaven
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.180]   who's just having fun playing with my life?
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.580]   I was in this place of darkness, deep hurt and deep pain.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:27.120]   And in those days, I found it really hard to readjust.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.780]   But I can't even begin to describe to you what it was like
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.140]   the moment that my wife and I showed up at Mother's Choice
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.680]   and we met Mia, our adopted daughter, for the first time.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:43.080]   The greatest joy I have ever experienced
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.720]   in this little half Nepalese and half Indonesian,
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.480]   gorgeous little 60-month-old girl.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.220]   And although I thought my family would be built biologically,
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.980]   God has built this family through other ways
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.220]   that are beautiful and profound.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:01.220]   And my greatest joy, Mia, has come from my deepest pain.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.820]   And it's a wonderful thing.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:09.880]   Worship and weeping side by side.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.940]   And I love the way that Ezra describes this for us
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.180]   in this moment, 'cause I think this is really important.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.220]   Verse 13, "No one could distinguish the sounds
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.320]   "of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.240]   "because people made such a noise."
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.640]   Could you imagine the moment where you're before this rubble
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.080]   and everybody is either praising at the top of their voices
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.020]   or wailing and weeping at the top of their voices.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.920]   And these things come together in such a way
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.480]   that they blend together and create this other kind of sound
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.940]   where you can't distinguish between the two.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.180]   One of the ways I would describe it to you is this.
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.380]   Worship and weeping may be different notes,
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.280]   but they are found on the same scale.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.540]   And when they play together,
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:58.980]   they produce this unexpected but profound harmony.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.080]   That is the sound of restoration.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.740]   And could you imagine a community
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.840]   where both weeping and worshiping can happen
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.140]   as much as it happens, so much that it all blends in together
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.040]   so that no one stands out?
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.040]   I mean, I don't know if you've ever been
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.920]   in one of those church services, maybe here at the Vine,
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.840]   where you're standing around
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.280]   and suddenly someone next to you
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.540]   starts wailing their eyes out.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.540]   It's like, "Oh, that's awkward.
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.980]   "Oh, that's kind of weird.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.440]   "Why is that person doing that?
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.380]   "I'm kind of uncomfortable right now."
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.340]   Or maybe you come into church here on a Sunday
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.920]   and you're feeling like, "Man, that was a tough week.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.180]   "Things are going really bad."
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.040]   Maybe you've just had some bad news and you come in
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.140]   and the person you happen to sit next to you
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.540]   is the one who's the happiest
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.780]   and the loudest in their worship.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.580]   And you're like, "Oh my gosh, Lord, I wanna run away."
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.880]   When it's just one or two people,
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.680]   it stands out and feels awkward for everybody.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.080]   But imagine a community
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.940]   where everyone has permission to worship or weep,
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.040]   where everyone can come to church
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.880]   with whatever's going on in their lives
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.980]   and go, "This is a safe place for me to let it out.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.240]   "This is a safe place for me to put my hand up
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.220]   "and say, 'I need prayer.'
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.280]   "This is a safe place to weep
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.120]   "because there's some godly sorrow
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.380]   "that I'm wrestling with my life.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.440]   "This is a safe place to praise as loud as I want.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.020]   "I can do it because everything is happening together."
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.580]   Whether in our gatherings like this, in our small groups,
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.740]   no matter how it might happen,
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.940]   there's such a cacophony of worship and weeping
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.220]   that a harmony is created and everybody can grow
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:29.640]   because they're welcomed, they're safe, they're loved,
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.520]   and they can be just who in that moment they are.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.720]   That, my friends,
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.880]   that, my friends, is worth a golf clap.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.520]   Nice par.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.620]   That, my friends, is church.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.920]   That's what I want the Lord to read.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.180]   So I'm gonna close with this.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.180]   I'm gonna close with three ways
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.140]   that I think we at The Vine can actually invest into this,
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.720]   that we can make a space here for restoration and renewal.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.620]   Here it is.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.320]   Number one, we should always treat people around us
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.120]   with dignity, respect, and value.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.620]   Can I have an amen?
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.980]   Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.580]   smelling really badly?
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:12.880]   Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.720]   really down and depressed and heavy?
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.380]   Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.080]   with a promotion that week, praising Jesus?
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.320]   Like it's amazing that we can respect people,
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.040]   that one who sings really loudly behind you out of tune,
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   and you wanna turn around and go, "Who are you?"
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.040]   Isn't it wonderful that they can be here?
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.440]   Isn't it wonderful that the person next to you
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.400]   can wail and cry and you not feel awkward about it?
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.200]   Isn't it wonderful that you have a senior pastor
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.500]   who claps really loudly all the time
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.800]   and it really annoys you?
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.240]   Amen?
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:50.360]   Isn't it wonderful that we can be together
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.100]   and be ourselves and not have to pretend
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.740]   to be anything else?
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:58.640]   But that will only happen when we feel safe of one another.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.940]   And that will only happen if we give respect
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.600]   and dignity and value that every person here
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.900]   made in the image of God should demand from you.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.000]   Here's the second thing.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.560]   While our worship should be orderly and respectful,
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.160]   Paul writes about that in 1 Corinthians 14,
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.400]   we should not expect or force people to believe uniformly.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.840]   We should not expect people to put their hands up
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.700]   if they don't want to,
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.240]   open their hands if they don't want to,
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.400]   sing aloud if they don't want to.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.700]   We should allow space for people to express who they are
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.860]   and how they wanna worship in this moment.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.140]   Worship and weeping side by side.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.140]   The worst thing we could do is try to conform people
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:36.960]   to a certain way.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.500]   That doesn't mean we can't have good discipleship,
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.540]   we can't have metrics, we can't have culture,
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.540]   we have all those things,
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.200]   but our heart is to say,
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.140]   we're not trying to conform you to behave in a certain way,
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.100]   we're trying to you to feel like you can come in here
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.240]   and shake the heavens
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.100]   and whatever that might mean for you.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.200]   Here's the third and final thing.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.000]   Because the God we worship knows us better
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.160]   than we know ourselves,
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.560]   we should not pretend in God's presence.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.860]   And I think that's something that I think
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.300]   I struggle with sometimes, and I'm sure you do too a bit.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.700]   I'm just gonna shove that under the carpet,
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.240]   I'm just gonna pretend that that's not there,
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.840]   I'm just gonna like, I don't wanna embarrass myself,
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.200]   I don't wanna stand out,
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.440]   so I'm just gonna put my hands up and sing,
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.340]   but I'm feeling like I need to weep,
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.560]   or I'm gonna praise, but the people around me
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.000]   seem like they're having a really hard time,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.600]   so I better just calm down.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.660]   How beautiful it would be if we realized
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.640]   that in God's presence,
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.100]   because he knows us better than anyone,
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.640]   we don't need to pretend.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.460]   In his presence is the only place in this world
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.540]   where you are completely free to be who you are.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:41.660]   Everywhere else, in your workplace,
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.000]   in your family and other places,
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.440]   you will find pressure to try to conform to something.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.900]   You do not need to conform in God's presence
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.640]   to anything other than Jesus Christ.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.460]   - Yeah.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.800]   - Imagine what that would feel like.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:01.100]   That would be a community of transformation
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.740]   where people could come in here and heal and receive
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:09.740]   and have promises and forgiveness and life and celebration,
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.840]   and together, we would become the people
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.500]   that God has called us to be.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:20.500]   Takenu Osaku, shake the heavens, Lord.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.700]   Would your power come down and change us, amen?
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.200]   (congregation applauding)
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.820]   You don't have to open your hands
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.800]   'cause you are free to behave however you want,
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.720]   but I wanna pray for us.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.560]   Can we pray?
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:43.620]   Holy Spirit, here we are.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:48.500]   And I want you personally just to take a moment.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.020]   This is where you are.
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:57.160]   In this moment, you don't need to be anyone else
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.000]   other than you.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.400]   You come to the throne of God's grace just as you are.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:11.500]   Father, we just come against the enemy's strategy
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.820]   for pretense.
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:19.120]   And Father, we just come naked and unashamed before you.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.580]   (gentle music)
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:26.760]   Father, for those in this room in this moment
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.020]   who need to weep,
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:33.880]   maybe a godly sorrow that sits on them,
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:38.560]   that beautiful and profound work of renewal and repentance.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:44.380]   Or maybe it's just the grief of something lost
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:45.780]   that needs to be mourned.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.640]   Father, would you just come now by your Spirit?
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:59.360]   The Lord would say you have permission to hurt and heal,
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.120]   to be who you are.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.600]   This is a safe place.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.880]   So Lord, for those in this moment
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.600]   that want to just be in your presence,
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.800]   just weep, take that time.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.120]   Would you just give them that space now?
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.200]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:22.280]   Now, maybe some of you here too,
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:27.000]   where that joy and that praise is bubbling out of you.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.040]   And this is the time for you just to come before the Lord
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.620]   in your heart and just praise Him, thank Him.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:34.640]   He is good, His love endures forever.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.000]   To make space for Him to move in us and through us that way.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.620]   Whether it is the need to weep or the need to worship.
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.520]   I wanna invite you just to take a moment
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.080]   and just come Holy Spirit, come.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:56.360]   Thank you Lord that you meet us where we're at.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.420]   Thank you for your grace.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.000]   (gentle music)
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:20.220]   So gonna invite the prayer team just to be present with us.
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:26.460]   I wanna invite you just to sit in the presence of the Lord
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.460]   if you would like to.
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:30.140]   In a moment, we're just gonna close the service.
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.760]   If you need to go, we totally respect and understand that,
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.020]   but we just ask that you would go quietly
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.180]   and just respect those that would wanna remain.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.620]   And whether that's just to praise Him
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.060]   or to just come before Him with that grief,
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.460]   we're gonna make space for that.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.020]   If you'd like to come forward for prayer,
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.780]   we'll have a team that's available to pray for you.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.180]   If you wanna just sit where you are
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.940]   and just let the worship kind of play over you
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.780]   and just take your own time to pray.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.900]   If you wanna pray with the people around you
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.300]   that you've come with, whatever it might be,
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:03.100]   if you need to leave, you're blessed to leave.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.900]   But I wanna just pray in this moment now.
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.700]   Father, as we just close this time, Lord,
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:08.620]   for those that need to go,
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.540]   we bless them into the week ahead.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.580]   For those that you want to stay, to just receive,
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.420]   to be prayed for, just to sit in your presence,
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.540]   we pray for that space.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.660]   Lord, we thank you that this is a community
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.820]   of transformation, a safe place for all.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.660]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.180]   So if you'd like to receive prayer,
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.460]   feel free to come forward for prayer.
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.060]   If you wanna stay, just stay, relax.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.500]   If you need to go, bless you.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.060]   (gentle music)
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.660]   (gentle music)
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.260]   (gentle music)
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.820]   (phone beeps)
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:50.340]   (phone beeps)
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.940]   (phone beeps)
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:57.540]   (phone beeps)
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.120]   (gentle music)
