1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 In Jesus' name.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,680
 Everyone says, hey, can we thank our worship team as always?

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,400
 Amazing.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,280
 Have a seat, have a seat.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,440
 And as you see it, I wonder whether you could imagine

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,400
 with me or think with me back to your childhood.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,160
 And I want you to think about the greatest memories

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,200
 that you have of your childhood.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,760
 The times in your heart and in your lives

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,000
 that you remember back and you think back to almost

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,080
 what I would call core memories of your childhood.

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,760
 Those moments where you think about all the great things

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,240
 that happened for you.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,360
 And maybe some of you have great memories of your family

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,600
 or great memories of a holiday you took

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
 or whatever it might be, but those memories where you're

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,800
 like, that defines who I was as a child.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,560
 Those are memories that I cherish,

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,640
 memories that I celebrate.

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,440
 For me, so many of my core childhood memories,

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,360
 they're located largely in one singular place.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,360
 And that's this house.

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,280
 This is the house that I lived in from the age

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,200
 of eight years old to about 11 years old.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,120
 The house is located in a small town in Connecticut

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,120
 on the Northeastern side of the US called Wilton.

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,800
 Wilson's a small town and we lived in a small cul-de-sac

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,280
 in a small neighborhood.

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,200
 And so many of my great childhood memories

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,880
 are from this particular house.

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,920
 I think one of the reasons why I love this house so much

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,240
 is 'cause my dad loved this house so much.

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,080
 My dad worked for a bank in the UK

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,080
 and he received a promotion.

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,360
 And when I was seven years old, the bank said,

36
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,600
 "We wanna move you to the US and you're gonna start working

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,840
 "for the bank in the US."

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680
 And so for a year we lived in Charlotte

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,400
 and then we moved up to this house.

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,760
 And I remember my dad loved this house.

41
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,400
 In fact, my dad probably took this photo.

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,560
 This photo is from the early '80s.

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,320
 My dad took this photo because the house represented

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,000
 for him really the first time in his life

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,200
 that he was able to provide something significant

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,360
 for his family.

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,680
 He had a family of five and he had provided this home

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,360
 and there was a certain sense of pride

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,160
 that his family could grow up

50
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,880
 in a beautiful, spacious place like this.

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,280
 My greatest memories of my father are found in this home.

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,000
 I remember he taught me how to throw a baseball

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,520
 and catch it in the driveway of this house.

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,400
 We played football on the lawn that you can see here,

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,480
 both the American kind and the British kind right there.

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,000
 At winter, my father taught me how to ski here.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,480
 It would snow in Connecticut and you can't see it,

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,440
 but on the left side of the building,

59
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,080
 there's a steep slope right there.

60
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,960
 My father taught me to ski down that slope.

61
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,480
 I remember the many hours that I spent with my father

62
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,320
 sitting in the living room here in like the little den area

63
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,200
 playing on an Atari Commodore 64.

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,540
 I don't know if anyone is old enough to remember that.

65
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,440
 That was a computer before they were computers basically.

66
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,480
 So many of my favorite memories are of my father here

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,720
 and when I think about the best times of my childhood,

68
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,220
 this is the place I think of.

69
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,320
 When my father passed away in March of 2019,

70
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,000
 I felt this overriding urge and motivation

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,240
 to return back to this house and visit it again.

72
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,680
 This overriding sense of heart that I had,

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,920
 that I wanted to reconnect with my father

74
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,280
 in the very place where I had

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,880
 the greatest memories of my father.

76
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,720
 The funny thing is when we left here,

77
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,180
 when I was age 11 and we moved here to Hong Kong,

78
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,040
 we never went back.

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,320
 I hadn't been back for over 35 or so years

80
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,760
 and so I felt as my father passed

81
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,280
 that to honor his memory and to reconnect with him

82
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
 in a deep way, I needed to get back to this house

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
 and so we had a sabbatical in the summer of 2019

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,640
 and so my wife, my daughter, myself, my mom and my brother,

85
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,680
 we jumped on a plane from Hong Kong,

86
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,240
 we flew to New York, we hired a car,

87
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,200
 we drove the three hours up the freeway

88
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,840
 and we entered into Wilton

89
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,480
 and the very first place we stopped was this house.

90
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,640
 I remember pulling up along the driveway,

91
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,440
 remember, quiet cul-de-sac, we parked the car,

92
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,920
 all of us got out of the car and there was this fence

93
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,000
 that lined up next to the house

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,480
 and we leaned on the fence and we looked at the house

95
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,360
 for the first time in 35 years.

96
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,240
 We would have looked very strange.

97
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,120
 That's what the house looks like today.

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,280
 It's essentially the same house

99
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,200
 just with a different paint job

100
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,440
 and as we were staring at it, staring at it,

101
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,120
 if anybody had driven by, it would have been weird,

102
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,760
 this group of like seven people just going like this.

103
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,360
 I remember the joy that I felt in my heart

104
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
 because Mia, my daughter, was with me

105
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,440
 as we were looking at this house

106
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,600
 and she was about the same age as I was

107
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,720
 when I lived there.

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,920
 And as I was staring at the house,

109
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,640
 I realized this is not enough for me.

110
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,120
 I have to be inside the house.

111
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,840
 This is a very creepy thing, I know,

112
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,540
 but I had to work out how am I gonna get myself

113
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,560
 inside this house?

114
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,240
 So I devised a plan.

115
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,960
 I decided that I would buy a really nice card

116
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,360
 and I would write a letter inside this card

117
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,080
 and in the letter I would say,

118
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,540
 I used to live in this house from the age of eight to 11

119
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,040
 and it was my father's favorite house

120
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,200
 and my father's just died of cancer

121
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,760
 and you need to let me come in

122
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,280
 and relive the memories of this house.

123
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
 Please let me in.

124
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
 Here's my mobile phone, call me.

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,760
 I wrote the best letter anyone has ever written

126
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,120
 and I dropped it into the little mailbox.

127
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,360
 You know, like in America, you put up the little flag,

128
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,120
 you know, to say that there was some mail there,

129
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,960
 did a little prayer and then we retreated to our hotel.

130
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
 I got my mobile out and I was like,

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,720
 two hours later, the phone rings

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
 and it's the wife in the house.

133
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,920
 She's wife, husband, two kids

134
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,160
 and she's like crying on the phone.

135
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,420
 She's like, your letter so moved me.

136
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,880
 We bought this house five years ago

137
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,540
 and we love this home and it's so good to hear

138
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,600
 that you love it as well and your father's just passed away

139
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,480
 and would you like to come over tomorrow

140
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,000
 at 10 o'clock for coffee?

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,960
 I would love to host you in the home

142
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,640
 and help you to relive your memories

143
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,680
 and I was like, yeah.

144
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,080
 Four hours later, the phone rings again.

145
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,440
 This time, it's the husband of the house.

146
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,240
 This is a very different conversation

147
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,320
 to the one with the wife of the house.

148
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,700
 The husband's like, who are you?

149
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,680
 Why do you wanna come into my house when I'm not around?

150
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,280
 Like, who are you?

151
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,680
 Tell me about, and literally, like he was kind of aggressive

152
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
 he was like, how do I know you're not a freak?

153
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,360
 How do I know that you're gonna come into this house

154
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,520
 and you've just written a nice letter

155
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
 to work your way into the home

156
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
 and you're gonna do something nasty in our house?

157
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,200
 Like, this is terrible, who are you?

158
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,680
 So basically, he's asking for like a LinkedIn live

159
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,720
 kind of like go through my whole history with him, right?

160
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,240
 So I'm like, well, I was born in the UK

161
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,480
 and I started to go through my history.

162
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
 That wasn't good enough.

163
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,360
 He wanted to know every place that I'd ever worked

164
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,960
 and what position I had held in the places where I worked.

165
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,960
 It was like I was being interviewed for the CIA.

166
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,640
 So I'm going like, okay, sure.

167
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,640
 So, well, I originally worked at this headhunting company

168
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,600
 and I did that for a while

169
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,560
 and then I moved to an American investment bank

170
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,320
 called Morgan Stanley and I worked there for a while.

171
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,200
 He's like, what did you just say?

172
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
 And I said, oh, I worked for a US investment bank

173
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,480
 called Morgan Stanley, I worked there.

174
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,320
 He's like, you worked for Morgan Stanley?

175
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,160
 I said, yeah.

176
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,080
 He said, I've worked for Morgan Stanley for 38 years.

177
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,760
 And he said, if you've worked for Morgan Stanley,

178
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,800
 if you're good enough to work for Morgan Stanley,

179
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,480
 you're good enough to come into my house.

180
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,480
 (audience laughing)

181
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,800
 So the next day, 10 o'clock, knock on the door.

182
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,240
 The wife welcomes us into my childhood home.

183
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,160
 And I can't really describe the emotions I felt

184
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,000
 as I walked through that house.

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
 We got this cheesy family photo outside.

186
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,920
 The one on the top there is my mom

187
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,960
 when she was super young with her mother

188
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,240
 and there's my mom and the rest of our family

189
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,120
 and my daughter there outside the front.

190
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,480
 As we walked through every single room,

191
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
 I just had wave after wave of emotion

192
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,000
 and memory of my father.

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,120
 I remember connecting with him deeply as I was walking,

194
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,440
 but I also sensed something else

195
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,600
 that I didn't expect to sense.

196
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,280
 And that was a sense of closure.

197
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,560
 I actually felt like my father was with me

198
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,400
 walking through the house and saying,

199
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,240
 "This was what you had.

200
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,280
 "And this is what we had.

201
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,500
 "And it was a good thing.

202
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,620
 "But now you have a daughter of your own

203
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,680
 "and you have future core memories

204
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,640
 "that you need to give to her."

205
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,280
 And I felt like my father was like passing a baton to me

206
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 as I was walking through the home.

207
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,040
 And I realized that in that moment,

208
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,800
 there was a shift that was happening within me.

209
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,400
 And this house meant so much to me,

210
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,840
 so many of my core memories,

211
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,200
 so many of my memories as a child to a father.

212
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,520
 And I felt like what my father was encouraging me to do

213
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,800
 as I walked through the house was to shift my mentality

214
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
 and my identity to thinking about myself

215
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,320
 not as a child to a father in this home,

216
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
 but now as a father to my child, Mia.

217
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,520
 And that shifting point in identity

218
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
 was one of the key reasons why I was able

219
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,960
 to begin to move through the morning

220
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,000
 that I was feeling at this time.

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,880
 I remember leaving that house and getting in the car

222
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,560
 and feeling very emotional, shedding a few tears,

223
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,120
 thinking to myself, "I'm a father and I have a daughter

224
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,300
 "and I get to create such great memories.

225
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,300
 "And I wanna live my father's legacy

226
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,480
 "by now shifting away from just thinking about being his son

227
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,120
 "to being a father myself."

228
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,640
 As we come to the halfway point of Exodus

229
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320
 and as we come to chapters 19 and 20

230
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,920
 that we're looking at this week and next week,

231
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,800
 this idea of a shift in identity

232
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,320
 is what these two chapters are all about.

233
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,400
 These are the chapters that capture for us

234
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,200
 Moses and Israel returning to the very place

235
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,040
 where Moses had been some 35, 40 odd years earlier,

236
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,200
 a place that held for him so many great core memories,

237
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,400
 the very place where he had met with God 40 years before

238
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,360
 in the burning bush

239
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
 and had such a profound encounter with God.

240
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,480
 He's now returned to the same place, Mount Sinai.

241
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,200
 And this Mount Sinai was a little bit like me

242
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,880
 returning to that house in Connecticut.

243
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,600
 It was a place of deep connection for him.

244
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,000
 Could we put up the Mount Sinai picture, please?

245
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,440
 There you go.

246
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,600
 It was a place of connection for Moses.

247
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,120
 It was a place where he could find himself

248
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,800
 with God once again, because prior, 40 years ago,

249
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
 that's what had happened for him.

250
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,760
 That time in the burning bush, Moses was a broken man,

251
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,880
 a broken man struggling with his identity,

252
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,280
 wondering, am I actually a prince of Egypt

253
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,520
 or am I an Israelite?

254
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,600
 And he's stuck between these two identities

255
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,400
 that were causing him a lot of tension.

256
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,040
 He had just murdered an Egyptian

257
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,480
 and fled from that Egyptian.

258
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,320
 And now here he is in this mountain

259
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,720
 and God appears in a fire on a bush

260
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,240
 and calls him towards him.

261
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,200
 Says, "Take up your sandals."

262
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,760
 The ground, he's standing on this holy ground.

263
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,000
 And God begins to speak to him of a new identity.

264
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,560
 Begins to say that I've got a purpose

265
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
 and a value and something for your life.

266
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,280
 And Moses begins to realize

267
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,960
 that his life has not come to an end here.

268
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,400
 There's a new beginning.

269
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,720
 And he begins to receive the call from God

270
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
 to go back to Egypt,

271
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,280
 the very place that he did not want to go to,

272
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
 and actually say to Pharaoh, "Let my people go,"

273
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,680
 because God wants them to come and to be with him.

274
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,520
 And as God's giving him this vision

275
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
 and this idea of his identity,

276
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,120
 Moses is pushing back on it.

277
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,560
 And I think we all do this as Christians.

278
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,040
 When God speaks to us of calling and vision and identity,

279
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,680
 it's very easy for us to push back and say,

280
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,080
 "Well, I can't do that.

281
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
 "That can't be me.

282
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,360
 "I'm not like that.

283
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,240
 "I don't have those gifts.

284
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,200
 "I don't have those skills."

285
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,880
 And Moses is doing this before God.

286
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,840
 And God, because he's a father,

287
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,040
 gives a fatherly promise to Moses at this time.

288
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,600
 This is in chapter three.

289
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,640
 We've looked at this before,

290
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
 but let me just remind you of this.

291
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,240
 In chapter three, verse 12,

292
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,200
 and God says this to Moses, "I will be with you.

293
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,360
 "And this will be a sign to you

294
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,200
 "that it is I who has sent you.

295
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,520
 "When you have brought the people out of Egypt,

296
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,040
 "you will worship God on this mountain."

297
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,360
 In other words, you're gonna return back

298
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,800
 to this very place with a free people.

299
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
 And at that time, Moses was like,

300
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,240
 "I don't even know if that's ever gonna happen."

301
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,720
 And now, as we're in chapter 19,

302
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
 the very thing that Moses believed would never happen

303
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
 has happened.

304
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,440
 He and Israel return to the mountain to worship God.

305
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,160
 Let me read to you how actually Moses talks about it

306
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,200
 at the start of chapter 19.

307
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,680
 "In the third month, after the Israelites left Egypt,

308
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,120
 "on the very day,"

309
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,240
 notice this, Moses is being very personal here.

310
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,960
 He's like, "I remember the very day

311
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,120
 "they came to the desert of Sinai.

312
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,560
 "After they set out from Rephidim,

313
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,960
 "they entered the desert of Sinai,

314
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
 "and Israel camped there in the desert

315
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,920
 "in front of the mountain."

316
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,800
 I wonder if you could sense the emotions

317
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,200
 that Moses must've been feeling.

318
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,880
 Like me, walking through the house

319
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,720
 and all those emotions of those connections

320
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
 to core memories.

321
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,120
 Now, here's Moses standing at the mountain

322
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
 with all of Israel with him,

323
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,280
 and all those core memories come back.

324
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,560
 And all that God had promised

325
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,880
 and all that God said he would do has actually happened.

326
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,120
 And I can imagine that Moses is standing at the mountain

327
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,000
 full of joy, full of wonder, full of amazement

328
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,080
 that God has done what he said he was gonna do,

329
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,200
 that his people are free and his people have gathered.

330
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,600
 And you could sense Moses welling up in worship.

331
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,680
 The very thing that God has said,

332
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,600
 "You're gonna return to this mountain and worship me."

333
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,280
 There is Moses going, "I can't believe it, but we're here."

334
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,640
 This is personal for Moses,

335
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,520
 because he has gone from a place of a broken identity

336
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,520
 to a place of a leader of his people.

337
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,960
 And as he's standing at that mountain,

338
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,680
 I'm sure he's saying, "Only because of you, God."

339
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,880
 This personal nature for Moses with Mount Sinai

340
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,600
 was what I wanted to try and capture for you

341
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,760
 as we actually did a film for this particular week.

342
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,880
 And when I was talking to the crew some four years ago

343
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,600
 and we were planning out every film,

344
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,040
 I was like, "Wouldn't it be awesome

345
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,160
 if we actually did the hike up Mount Sinai ourself?"

346
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,800
 Now, Moses, when he did it, there was no path there at all.

347
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,840
 And these days, there's a very well-worn path.

348
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,640
 And if you're fit, you can actually do

349
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,600
 the about four and a half hour hike

350
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,040
 from the base of Mount Sinai up to the top.

351
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,600
 If you're not fit, you can get a camel

352
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,800
 to take you up three quarters of the way,

353
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,560
 but then you still gotta do about a quarter of it.

354
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,680
 And we thought it'd be fantastic.

355
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,800
 Why don't we film this?

356
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,760
 And unlike the other films in the series

357
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,000
 where we have scripts and we have it all planned out,

358
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,440
 this one, we're just gonna make it pretty raw.

359
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,480
 Because for Moses, it would have been raw.

360
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,040
 It would have been this kind of pilgrimage

361
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,000
 for him to go up a mountain.

362
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,960
 I said, "Why don't I go on a pilgrimage up the mountain?

363
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,840
 Let's film it.

364
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,920
 Let's not script it.

365
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,240
 Let's just see what happens.

366
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
 Let's capture it for everybody."

367
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,680
 And hopefully in that,

368
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,720
 help people to understand the personal nature

369
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,760
 of what chapters 19 and 20 are all about,

370
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,660
 but also the personal nature

371
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,320
 of what this part of the Exodus story has to say to you.

372
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,080
 So let's take a look at my hike.

373
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:03,200
 Exodus chapter 19 is perhaps the most pivotal chapter

374
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,520
 in the whole of the Exodus story.

375
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,520
 God calls Moses up to the top of Mount Sinai

376
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,160
 so he can meet with him,

377
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,620
 commune face to face,

378
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,960
 and ultimately give him the 10 commandments

379
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,760
 that will shape God's people forever.

380
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,360
 Now, ever since I was a kid

381
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,060
 and came to faith in my early 20s,

382
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,780
 I've always had this deep desire in me

383
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,660
 to follow in Moses' footsteps,

384
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,340
 to actually do the hike myself up Mount Sinai

385
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,780
 and kind of experience for myself

386
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,660
 what it would be like to meet with God on the mountain.

387
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,000
 Well, today, actually, the dream comes into reality.

388
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,180
 I'm about to hike up Mount Sinai here,

389
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,460
 and there are some camels right here

390
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,580
 that are gonna go right past me.

391
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,420
 Watch this, watch this.

392
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,380
 This is a real thing.

393
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,220
 Go.

394
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,800
 (gentle music)

395
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,840
 There you go.

396
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,720
 That's how it works here.

397
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,040
 All right, anyway, so I just stepped in the camel poo too.

398
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,720
 But anyway, the camels are gonna go ahead of us.

399
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,960
 I'm gonna hike up to Mount Sinai right now,

400
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,980
 and I'm really excited.

401
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,800
 It's about just before midnight.

402
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,920
 It's super cold.

403
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,960
 It's gonna be a little bit windy,

404
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,720
 but I'm really excited to do this,

405
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,200
 and I can't wait 'cause I'm gonna bring you along

406
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,520
 with me on the journey.

407
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,360
 Let's go.

408
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,940
 (gentle music)

409
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,940
 (gentle music)

410
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:25,080
 As I take the first few steps here

411
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,560
 past St. Catherine's Monastery,

412
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,960
 yeah, I'm reflecting on kind of the journey already.

413
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,880
 It's been four years of the Exodus Project

414
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,920
 to get to this point,

415
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,140
 and it's taken years of study and research and preparation,

416
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,480
 and then COVID delayed it,

417
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,560
 and then now I'm finally here.

418
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,760
 I've dreamt about this hike for so long,

419
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,600
 and it makes me think about our Christian journey, actually,

420
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,280
 that while study and research of Scripture

421
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,480
 is, of course, important,

422
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,680
 it's actually the doing that really counts.

423
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,280
 It's actually putting what you've learned into practice

424
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,480
 that matters the most,

425
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,680
 and every single step I'm taking

426
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,320
 is a little bit kind of a metaphor on my own Christian life

427
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,560
 in the sense that every single day

428
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,920
 I have to take that next step in my journey with Jesus,

429
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,680
 and it's a practice of faith.

430
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,400
 It's not just a research of faith,

431
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
 and as I start out on the trip,

432
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,520
 I'm reflecting a little bit about Moses's journey himself.

433
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,440
 I mean, he didn't have a nice path to walk on like I do.

434
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,160
 He would have had to scramble up all the rocks

435
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,320
 to get to the summit,

436
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,080
 and I'm sure at the beginning point,

437
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,520
 Moses was thinking to himself,

438
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,960
 "Why doesn't God come and meet me down here?

439
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,800
 "Why do I have to go up there to meet with God?"

440
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,400
 I mean, God had met Moses on a flat plain

441
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,080
 in a burning bush in the past.

442
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,360
 Why not now?

443
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,120
 And I think God was trying to teach Moses something.

444
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
 He was trying to let him know

445
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,000
 that actually the relationship he's forming in Israel

446
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,200
 is gonna require obedience, faithfulness.

447
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,600
 It's gonna require them to sacrifice.

448
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,160
 It's gonna be a hard, narrow path.

449
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,320
 Jesus, many years, would reflect the same.

450
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,760
 He would say, "If you wanna follow me,

451
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,280
 "you're gonna have to pick up your cross.

452
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,600
 "There's gonna be sacrifice.

453
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,720
 "There's gonna be the need for obedience."

454
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,040
 And I think the journey up the mountain

455
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,920
 was really part of the formation for Moses.

456
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:11,720
 Here's another thought.

457
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,000
 You know, it's so dark here as we've been walking

458
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,840
 that I've been tempted to pull out a flashlight

459
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,480
 and use some artificial light to help me to walk.

460
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,120
 And I think we do that in our sin as well.

461
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,280
 When we're faced with the darkness of our sin,

462
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,680
 we try to throw some artificial light over it

463
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,200
 to make ourselves feel better about it,

464
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,360
 to try to pretend that it's no big deal,

465
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,000
 or maybe convince ourselves

466
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,400
 that we're gonna deal with it and get over it easily,

467
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,960
 when the reality is it's deeply entangled in us.

468
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,920
 See, when you hike in a place like this,

469
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,520
 it's actually best not to use artificial light.

470
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,760
 It's best just to walk in the darkness,

471
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,160
 to actually get accustomed to the darkness,

472
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,600
 to allow your eyes to realize

473
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,240
 the sort of optical illusion that is there

474
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,840
 when you use artificial light.

475
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,920
 And I think it's the same for our sin.

476
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,040
 When we put away those artificial lights

477
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,120
 that try to make ourselves feel better about it,

478
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,000
 and actually just sit in the actual reality

479
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
 of the darkness of sin,

480
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,280
 it enables us to know where we're starting

481
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,880
 when it comes to repentance.

482
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,720
 And I think that's such an important part

483
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,120
 of the Christian journey.

484
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,560
 I wanna encourage you to put away your artificial lights,

485
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,440
 and actually allow yourself to realize

486
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,240
 where you are in the sin that you're struggling with.

487
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,640
 And from that point, God can bring his real light.

488
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,000
 It's not artificial light when it comes to Christ.

489
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,120
 It's light that brings us into freedom.

490
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:37,200
 So we've been walking for about 40, 45 minutes now.

491
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,880
 That's St. Catherine's in the village down there.

492
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,160
 Our path is up here.

493
00:19:41,160 --> 00:20:01,720
 All right, I'm here at the halfway house of the mountain.

494
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,880
 I'm literally about halfway up now.

495
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,360
 And this is such a nice place to rest.

496
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,520
 I mean, it's so comfortable here.

497
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,960
 There's a beautiful fire.

498
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,000
 And I tell you what, it's quite cold on the mountain.

499
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,160
 So I've been here about 10 minutes now,

500
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,920
 and it's really comfortable.

501
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,200
 Had a cup of tea.

502
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,680
 And I've been reflecting that so often,

503
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,560
 this is like our spiritual journey.

504
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,320
 God calls us to a destination.

505
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,000
 And it's a difficult journey up the hill.

506
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,640
 And it takes a lot of courage and a lot of sacrifice.

507
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,320
 And we get about halfway,

508
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,920
 and we're tempted to settle there in our spiritual lives,

509
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,800
 in our spiritual halfway house.

510
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,880
 And we kind of convince ourselves,

511
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
 oh, yeah, God called me up there,

512
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,040
 but I've already sacrificed so much,

513
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,560
 and I'm happy where I am right now.

514
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,680
 And we kind of settle into this kind of halfway house

515
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,800
 mediocrity of our spiritual lives,

516
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,320
 knowing that Christ is calling us deeper,

517
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,600
 but happy just to settle where we are.

518
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,080
 And I think that's the great temptation

519
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,680
 of all of our spiritual journeys.

520
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,800
 And for me right now, I'd be happy to tell you,

521
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,400
 oh yeah, I made it to the top of the mountain,

522
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,200
 but kind of fake it and just stay here

523
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,840
 and then go back down the hill.

524
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,000
 But that's not really what it is.

525
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,400
 God has called us to be at the top,

526
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,280
 and we need to keep pressing into our relationship with Him.

527
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,760
 So I'm gonna rest a little bit more,

528
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,480
 and then I'm gonna pick myself up, get going again.

529
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,720
 And I wanna encourage you to do that

530
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,640
 in your spiritual life too.

531
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,760
 If you feel like you've kind of rested,

532
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,200
 if you feel like you've sort of settled

533
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,640
 into mediocrity in your spirituality,

534
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,080
 can I encourage you, get up, get going again.

535
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,160
 There's so much more that's ahead.

536
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,760
 (gentle music)

537
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:44,000
 As they say in Egypt, yalla.

538
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,120
 Yalla, all right, let's go.

539
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,920
 All right, we're about like, I don't know,

540
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,840
 maybe like three quarters of the way up now.

541
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,080
 And like this is Mount Sinai right here.

542
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,960
 This is the rock, you know what I mean?

543
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,160
 Like it's really actually beginning to feel

544
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,520
 a little bit like I think what Moses would have seen.

545
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,640
 I think the earlier part of the walk,

546
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,160
 it felt like I was in some national park

547
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,000
 anywhere in the world.

548
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,760
 But now when you see the kind of color here,

549
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,360
 you may not be able to see the color 'cause it's dark,

550
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,840
 but the actual shape and the feel,

551
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,120
 it's like this is kind of what I had in mind.

552
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,240
 And it's really special, really special.

553
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,800
 Mount Sinai.

554
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,400
 (laughs)

555
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:37,600
 I'm about three hours into the hike now

556
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,640
 and I'm on a staircase.

557
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,320
 It's a rock staircase.

558
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,440
 It's about 750 stairs now to the summit.

559
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,280
 So I'm not actually that far from the summit,

560
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,000
 but this is the hardest part of the hike.

561
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,400
 I'm out of breath.

562
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,080
 The stairs are tall and steep.

563
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,680
 And it's got me to reflect a little bit

564
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,400
 about our spiritual lives again, right?

565
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,440
 So often when we get close to a goal

566
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,360
 that Christ has put in our hearts, things get harder.

567
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,680
 You know, we often think in a climb up the mountain

568
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,320
 that the hardest part is at the start.

569
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,160
 It's not true.

570
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,680
 The steepest part of the mountain

571
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,040
 is always right before the summit.

572
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,000
 And it's the same with us in our spiritual lives

573
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,760
 with the goals that Christ gives us.

574
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,200
 The enemy loves to come in right at the end

575
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,880
 when we've almost achieved the goal

576
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
 and try to knock us back again,

577
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,800
 try to make it so hard that we'll quit

578
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,680
 right at the finish line.

579
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,240
 And I'm kind of feeling like that right now.

580
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,360
 I'm like, man, I don't know if I've got much more energy

581
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,200
 to get up there.

582
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,480
 And that's when we need to press in again.

583
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,880
 We need to push through that barrier and keep going.

584
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,360
 And I imagine Moses,

585
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,280
 as he's at this part of the mountain as well,

586
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,800
 he's thinking like, it's not that far, but it's super hard.

587
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,200
 I think the hardest part of the climb

588
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,760
 is ahead of us right now.

589
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,120
 And yeah, so we've got to push in.

590
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,520
 Actually, there are actually about 3,750 steps

591
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,280
 from the very base of the mountain to the summit.

592
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,800
 And the monks that live here,

593
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,560
 they call it the staircase of repentance

594
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,720
 because of the pain involved in getting up to the top.

595
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,560
 And I have to say, now that I'm almost there,

596
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,760
 these stairs are very well-named.

597
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,360
 (gentle music)

598
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:41,160
 Well, after nearly four hours of hiking,

599
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,080
 I finally made it to the summit.

600
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,960
 You can't see much right now 'cause it's still night.

601
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,640
 It's still dark.

602
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,200
 Ah, man, what a trip.

603
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,720
 That was incredible.

604
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,400
 Super hard, but I'm so glad to be here.

605
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,720
 I'm at 2,285 meters.

606
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,120
 That's how high we are right now.

607
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,480
 And in a few moments, the sun will rise up behind me.

608
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,080
 And you know, as I get here in the darkness,

609
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,520
 it makes me think about Moses

610
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,280
 when he first arrived on the summit.

611
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,800
 You know, he must've had this mixture

612
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,680
 of excitement and anticipation,

613
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,040
 but I would also think probably a little bit

614
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,960
 of anxiety and fear as he's about to walk into the fog,

615
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,480
 you know, the presence of God

616
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,920
 that was on the mountain at the time.

617
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,960
 And it must've been just this awesome sense of God here.

618
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,640
 And you know, the fear in him must've been very palpable.

619
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,480
 And you know, it's a significant moment.

620
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,600
 The courage of Moses to not just do the walk up here,

621
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,640
 but then to walk into the presence of God

622
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,440
 and literally receive the law

623
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,120
 that would come to reshape the Jewish people

624
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,000
 and who they are and really change all of history.

625
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,400
 That happened right here.

626
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,280
 And as I sit here in this moment,

627
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,840
 having finally achieved my dream,

628
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,680
 I'm really quite overwhelmed by the profundity

629
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,840
 of what happened right here.

630
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,240
 (soft music)

631
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:27,840
 There's a section in Exodus 19

632
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,320
 where in the Hebrew it reads this.

633
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,240
 It says, "Moses comes up to the top of the mountain

634
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
 "and then is on the top of the mountain."

635
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,160
 Now in the Hebrew, it repeats top of the mountain twice

636
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,640
 in the same sentence, and it has confounded scholars.

637
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,680
 But actually here is what it means.

638
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,280
 It means that for Moses,

639
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,400
 this experience of meeting God required two things.

640
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,040
 There was the coming up to the top of the mountain.

641
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,560
 That was the doing.

642
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,640
 But then when he was on the summit, like I am right now,

643
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,160
 he had to then be with God.

644
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,840
 That was the second part of being

645
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
 on the top of the mountain.

646
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,800
 So Moses was here and he needed to settle

647
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,400
 in the presence of God, be with him,

648
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,360
 stop his doing and just rest.

649
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,560
 And now that I'm here on the summit with the sun coming up,

650
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,360
 that's exactly what I wanna do.

651
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,720
 So I'm gonna wrap this up here.

652
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,800
 I'm so grateful that you were on the journey with me

653
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,320
 up the mountain, but now I'm just gonna spend some time

654
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,160
 to be with God.

655
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,560
 (soft music)

656
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,960
 (soft music)

657
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,360
 (soft music)

658
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,760
 (soft music)

659
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,760
 (soft music)

660
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,520
 It is this idea of being and not just doing

661
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,040
 that Exodus 19 and 20 are all about.

662
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,440
 Because it is now here where God is gonna reshape

663
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
 their identity as a people.

664
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,320
 It's been again to help them to understand

665
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,680
 who they truly are.

666
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,480
 And I wanna just unpack a little bit about that here,

667
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,880
 if you're willing to give me about another 10, 15 minutes.

668
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,800
 Is that all right?

669
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,920
 Everybody handle that?

670
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,000
 You didn't do the hike, I did the hike, say yes.

671
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,600
 (congregation laughing)

672
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,440
 Good.

673
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,120
 I did it for you.

674
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,640
 No, it's good, okay.

675
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,520
 Verse three says, "And Moses went up to God

676
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,840
 "and the Lord called to him from the mountain and said,

677
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,400
 "this is what you are to say to the house of Jacob

678
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,520
 "and what you are to tell the people of Israel.

679
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,760
 "You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt

680
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,920
 "and how I carried you on eagles wings

681
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,720
 "and brought you to myself."

682
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,560
 I love it.

683
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,400
 The first thing God does is he basically does

684
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,640
 like previously on the Exodus, right?

685
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,400
 And he takes them on this kind of journey

686
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,840
 of what's already happened.

687
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,120
 And he says, "You yourselves have seen what I did in Egypt.

688
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,640
 "You understood all the things that I've done,

689
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,240
 "how I revealed myself to you,

690
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
 "how I showed you my power and my might,

691
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,080
 "how I was compassionate for you.

692
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,080
 "You saw the plagues, you saw the parting of the Red Sea,

693
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,960
 "you saw the manifold from heaven.

694
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,600
 "You saw all of that and you understand that

695
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,820
 "because you know me.

696
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,520
 "I've revealed myself to you in all of that."

697
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
 He says, "I carried you on eagles wings,

698
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,520
 "the idea I'm intimately caring for you.

699
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,200
 "I stepped in, you didn't do any of that

700
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,080
 "in your own strength.

701
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,880
 "I did all that for you."

702
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,480
 God is saying, "I carried you

703
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,120
 "on these intimate eagles wings."

704
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,640
 And he said, "I brought you to myself."

705
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,400
 Notice this, he doesn't say, "I brought you to freedom."

706
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,760
 He doesn't say, "I brought you to success."

707
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,000
 He doesn't say, "I achieved all your dreams for you."

708
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,040
 He said, "What I've done for you is I freed you

709
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,560
 "in order that you would find a home in me,

710
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,720
 "that you would come to myself."

711
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,320
 You know, the greatest gift

712
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,200
 that God will ever give you is himself.

713
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,600
 Come on church, it is himself.

714
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
 It's not always the things that you're dreaming for.

715
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,800
 It's not always the things you're praying for.

716
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,680
 It's not even sometimes you're healing.

717
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,800
 It's not even sometimes that restoration you want.

718
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,280
 The greatest gift that he'll give

719
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,920
 and he wants to heal you, he wants to restore you,

720
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,820
 he wants to do all those things,

721
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,120
 but the greatest thing he will ever do for you

722
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,440
 is show himself to you, is welcome you into his presence

723
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,560
 so that you can have an intimate relationship with you.

724
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,400
 And he said, "I've done this.

725
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,060
 "I've carried you guys on my wings.

726
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,640
 "I've brought you to myself."

727
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,700
 And he starts by saying,

728
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,400
 "You yourselves have experienced all this."

729
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,840
 This is the only time in the Hebrew

730
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,160
 in the whole of the Old Testament

731
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,040
 where the words you is repeated twice side by side.

732
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,880
 So in English, we say you yourselves,

733
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,840
 but in the Hebrew, it's you, you.

734
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,060
 What he's saying is you corporately know what's happened,

735
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,220
 but you individually also know what's happened.

736
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,660
 In other words, you have a personal encounter

737
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,660
 and you've personally witnessed

738
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,840
 all the things that I've done

739
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,540
 from the time that you were in slavery in Egypt

740
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,540
 all the way up to now.

741
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,540
 It's like God is basically saying this to Israel.

742
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,540
 He's saying, "You know me, but do you know who you are?"

743
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,460
 You know who I am 'cause I've done all these things.

744
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,360
 I've revealed myself to you

745
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,520
 and you've seen it all personally, corporately in person.

746
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,480
 You know who I am, but do you know who you are?

747
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,920
 He's challenging them.

748
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,280
 Do you have an understanding of your identity?

749
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,240
 Do you know what it is that I've saved you for?

750
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,560
 Do you know what it is that I've rescued you for?

751
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,160
 Do you know what your purpose is, your value is,

752
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,000
 your mission is?

753
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,440
 Do you understand what it is that I've done in you?

754
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,220
 And the reality is that God had revealed himself

755
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,280
 to Moses at the burning bush, to Pharaoh,

756
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,760
 to Egypt and to Israel.

757
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,520
 He's brought them all to this mountain,

758
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,420
 but the story doesn't finish here.

759
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,760
 Chapter 19 would be a nice place

760
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,220
 to wrap up the story, wouldn't it?

761
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,540
 Maybe the Exodus could have been just chapters one to 19,

762
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,180
 and that would have been a nice bow on the whole story

763
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,940
 'cause we would have seen God's deliverance.

764
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,140
 But if that had happened,

765
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,220
 all we would have learned is who God is.

766
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,340
 And what God wants to do at this part of the story

767
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,220
 and for the next 20 chapters is to tell you who you are,

768
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,180
 to help Israel understand who they are

769
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,180
 in their identity with him

770
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,620
 and to help you understand who you are

771
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,140
 in your identity with Christ.

772
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,400
 That's what the rest of the Exodus story is all about.

773
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,520
 See, our journey in Exodus is not just a journey

774
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,720
 in a God who makes himself known,

775
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,300
 it's a journey in a God who makes ourselves known.

776
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,500
 And some of you here,

777
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,140
 you've experienced a deliverance out of some sin

778
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,440
 that you've been perhaps enslaved to,

779
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,160
 but you're still struggling to know who you are.

780
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,320
 You're still struggling to know what your value is,

781
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,740
 what your mission is, what your calling in life is.

782
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,720
 The number one question I get as a pastor,

783
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,480
 "Pastor Andrew, what is my calling in life?"

784
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,720
 Well, if you give me another 10 minutes,

785
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,400
 I'll tell you what your calling in life is

786
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,400
 because this is what Israel is crying out and wondering.

787
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,680
 We're free now, but what are we gonna do?

788
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,080
 Who are we?

789
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,400
 And what is God gonna do in and through us?

790
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,760
 And so God begins to unpack the idea of what he's gonna do.

791
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,680
 You need to understand that the number one thing

792
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,220
 that slavery does, it strips your identity from you.

793
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,980
 The whole definition of slavery is designed

794
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,100
 to strip from you your value and who you are

795
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,540
 and how you understand yourself.

796
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,060
 I've actually had, I wouldn't call it the privilege,

797
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,580
 but I've actually sat with traffickers in Bangkok.

798
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,340
 I was working with an NGO at the time

799
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,580
 and we were connected with traffickers, human traffickers.

800
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,460
 And I met with this trafficker and he explained to me

801
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,380
 that the number one priority they have

802
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,820
 when they take women is to so disempower

803
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,680
 and strip them of their identity

804
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,660
 that they basically think they have no worth

805
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,220
 and no value so they won't fight back.

806
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,460
 And that should shock us.

807
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,820
 But that's what the enemy does with every form of slavery.

808
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,900
 Any sin that we are enslaved through

809
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,400
 is designed to strip you of your identity

810
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,660
 and how you've been created in the image of God

811
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,380
 and how God sees you and to strip your value

812
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,900
 and how you understand yourself.

813
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,380
 And so when you get free from a sin,

814
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,660
 when God heals you and you bring your sin to him

815
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,420
 and you repent of it and he washes you white as snow,

816
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,620
 it's a wonderful thing,

817
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,540
 but there's another step that should happen after that.

818
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,860
 'Cause not only is it one thing to be taken out of slavery,

819
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,500
 it's another thing to then discover who we now truly are.

820
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,740
 Israel arrives at Mount Sinai

821
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,960
 and they have no idea who they are.

822
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,800
 Are you with this?

823
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,180
 And when we come out of our sin,

824
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,220
 we have to remember that we have lost

825
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,400
 something of our identity because of that sin.

826
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,820
 The enemy comes to kill and destroy,

827
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,420
 but Jesus comes to give life and life abundant.

828
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,480
 See, one of the very core ideas of the whole Exodus

829
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,560
 is that you're not just saved from something,

830
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,380
 you're saved to something.

831
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,260
 And this is where Israel is.

832
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,080
 And God is saying, "Do you know why I've saved you?

833
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,060
 Would you like to know why?

834
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,140
 No? Okay, let's go.

835
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,420
 Would you like to know why you're saved?

836
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,740
 Why you have a calling?

837
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,660
 Why God wants you free to himself

838
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,740
 so that you can live for him?

839
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,820
 Let me show you what God says next.

840
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,980
 Verse five.

841
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,020
 Now, if you obey me fully and keep my covenant,

842
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,140
 then out of all the nations,

843
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,460
 you will be my treasured possessions.

844
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,340
 Although the whole earth is mine,

845
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,220
 you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.

846
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,300
 These are the words that you are to speak to the Israelites.

847
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,700
 In a moment where Israel is going, "Who are we?"

848
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,180
 Because we don't know who we are anymore

849
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,500
 because in slavery, our whole identity has been submerged.

850
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,700
 We've been disempowered.

851
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,220
 We've been stripped of who we are.

852
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,900
 They're now standing at Mount Sinai

853
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,220
 and they're saying, "Who are we?"

854
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,980
 And the very first thing God says to Moses on the mountain

855
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,740
 is, "This is who you are."

856
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,700
 And for some of you in the room,

857
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,620
 what I'm about to tell you

858
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,820
 is the most singular important thing for you

859
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,980
 to truly grow in Christ Jesus.

860
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,060
 Because what God says in this moment

861
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,940
 helps to unpack so much for Israel

862
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,140
 and I think so much for you.

863
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,260
 Let me break down what it is that God does.

864
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,940
 Is this helpful for anyone?

865
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,900
 Okay, let me break down for you

866
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,140
 exactly what God is saying about...

867
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,140
 So first of all, God has made himself known.

868
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,500
 That's the first thing he tells Israel.

869
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,540
 He reminds them.

870
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,380
 Oh, hello.

871
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,100
 (mimics horn)

872
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,020
 This is not gonna go well, is it?

873
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,100
 Okay, here.

874
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,140
 (sings)

875
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,060
 All right, give me one second.

876
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,420
 I'm gonna fix this properly.

877
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,940
 Oh no, it's getting worse.

878
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,740
 It's really worth it, trust me, just wait.

879
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,860
 Hallelujah.

880
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,540
 So God has made himself known, remember?

881
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,020
 Through the whole of the Exodus journey.

882
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,740
 And in doing that, what he's done is he's delivered

883
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,740
 his people.

884
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,380
 Now, what you need to understand

885
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,700
 is that in his delivery of his people,

886
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,580
 he makes himself known as well.

887
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,900
 So first of all, God made himself known

888
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,180
 to Moses at burning bush.

889
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,020
 He delivers his people and in delivering his people,

890
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,580
 he further makes himself known.

891
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,660
 Does that make sense to you?

892
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,060
 So they come to understand his character, his nature,

893
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,420
 by the fact that he has delivered his people, right?

894
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,460
 Then what God says on Mount Sinai in this moment,

895
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,980
 when he says, he says, I'm creating for you

896
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,180
 what's called this covenantal relationship.

897
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,700
 Now, covenantal relationship.

898
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,140
 Now, I'm gonna come back to this more next week

899
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,100
 when we have a bit more time,

900
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,660
 but what covenantal relationship is

901
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,460
 is what's about to happen on the top of Mount Sinai

902
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,300
 with the giving of the law and all of that.

903
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,020
 God's saying, I've made myself known, I delivered you.

904
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,020
 Now, out of that, I'm gonna create

905
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,980
 a covenantal relationship with you

906
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,060
 so that you can truly understand who you are.

907
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,220
 And in this passage, he says two things for them

908
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,260
 about who they are.

909
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,900
 He says, first of all, you have to understand

910
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,340
 that you are what he calls priests.

911
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,360
 And he says, you gotta understand

912
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,380
 that you are also now called to be a holy nation.

913
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,220
 You are priests and you are holy.

914
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,480
 These are the fundamental parts

915
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,380
 of who we are in Christ Jesus.

916
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,860
 If you're wondering, who am I?

917
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,980
 What value do I have?

918
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,460
 What input can I make in the world?

919
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,940
 You are a priest and you are holy.

920
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,420
 Let me break these down real quick.

921
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,820
 Priests in the Old Testament,

922
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,580
 when God speaks to Israel about them being a priest,

923
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,740
 priests had three primary functions.

924
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,000
 Those functions were intercession, so praying,

925
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,660
 they were invitation, helping people to come

926
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,060
 into the presence of God, and they were imitation,

927
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,860
 helping to show the people God's character

928
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,240
 by how they live their lives.

929
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,880
 These three things, intercession, invitation,

930
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,780
 and imitation is what it meant to be a priest.

931
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,900
 Priests were the mediators between God and the world.

932
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,380
 They would help to connect the world

933
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,560
 and God together through prayer.

934
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,140
 They would pray on behalf of the world.

935
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,860
 What we just did a moment ago

936
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,620
 when we prayed for the situation in the Middle East,

937
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,600
 we were priests together.

938
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,540
 We were connecting God and the world together

939
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,820
 and saying there are needs and making that connection.

940
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,060
 We are to invite.

941
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,100
 Priests set the stage for people

942
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,980
 to encounter their worship of God.

943
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,540
 Christians are designed to invite people

944
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,980
 into the presence of God.

945
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,420
 That's what we're called to do.

946
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,100
 Imitation, the priest, we're called to show the world

947
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,340
 God's character by how they live their lives.

948
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,660
 So we as Christians are called to reveal the character

949
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,700
 and nature of God to everybody through how we live our lives.

950
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,640
 Intercession, invitation, imitation is who we're called to be

951
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,140
 but we're also called by God as holy.

952
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,660
 And this speaks of two areas, transformation,

953
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,380
 I can't spell, transformation and being set apart.

954
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,580
 It is the Holy Spirit that transforms us

955
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,980
 from our brokenness and our sin

956
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,900
 into the life that he wants us to be.

957
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,060
 Without his spirit at work in us, in our culture,

958
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,140
 in our society, there is no transformation.

959
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,580
 Transformation towards becoming more like Christ Jesus

960
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,520
 is always driven by his spirit.

961
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,940
 So when he says, I call you holy, I bless you to be holy,

962
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,980
 he's inviting us into a transformative journey

963
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,820
 in who we are.

964
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,060
 He sends you.

965
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,240
 And he says, you are to be set apart.

966
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,480
 Being holy is set apart,

967
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,200
 which means you should look different, be different,

968
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,320
 have different values to everything else

969
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,540
 you see in the world.

970
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,780
 He doesn't mean set apart in the sense that

971
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,440
 go up into a hill somewhere, be in a monastery

972
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,980
 and just act weird, okay?

973
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,580
 We're not supposed to be weird Christians

974
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,860
 but we are supposed to be set apart.

975
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,300
 We're all supposed to have different values

976
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,180
 and different purposes and different hope.

977
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,420
 When people around us feel like they've got no hope,

978
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,860
 we stand up and go, there is hope.

979
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,780
 We have a different culture, a different thinking,

980
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,820
 a different narrative.

981
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,660
 And God's saying, I've created you to be set apart

982
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,120
 in the world, but not of the world.

983
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,620
 I didn't call you to be out of the world

984
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,460
 and not of the world.

985
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,460
 I called you to be in the world, but not of the world.

986
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,860
 'Cause if you're in the world,

987
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,540
 but you're holding a different narrative,

988
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,940
 you're holding a different hope,

989
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,540
 you're holding a different lifestyle,

990
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,940
 you're holding different values,

991
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,940
 you begin to imitate my character to the world around you.

992
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,500
 Now more than ever here in Hong Kong,

993
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,580
 the church has to be holy.

994
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:55,460
 Not pious, close the doors, just worship Jesus on our own

995
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,420
 and not talk to anybody.

996
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,780
 Holy in the sense that we're set apart

997
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,480
 in the city that we're planted in.

998
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,220
 Carrying a different kind of narrative

999
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,860
 to the one that the world is currently hearing.

1000
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,820
 Are you with me?

1001
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,520
 Anyone else passionate about that?

1002
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,820
 And what God is saying is in these two things,

1003
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,300
 being holy and being priests,

1004
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,800
 we find our calling and our mission.

1005
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,780
 And next week, as we look at chapter 20,

1006
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,820
 we'll learn a lot more about what that calling

1007
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,260
 and that mission looks like.

1008
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,220
 But here as God speaks to them about identity change,

1009
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,540
 he's saying, "Know who you are."

1010
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,700
 You know who I am, do you know who you are?

1011
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,340
 Paul would write this, he would say,

1012
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:42,380
 "For we have been set free, now be free."

1013
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,060
 What he's saying is now live as God has called you to live.

1014
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,180
 Peter, as he's pastoring the first church,

1015
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,020
 he's trying to think,

1016
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,300
 "How do I help them to understand who they are?

1017
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,260
 How do I help them understand

1018
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,140
 that they're not just being saved and that's it?"

1019
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,380
 But there's so much more to the story.

1020
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,580
 And so interestingly, Peter writes to the church

1021
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,180
 and he actually quotes from this very chapter in Exodus 19.

1022
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,020
 Let me read this to you.

1023
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,420
 He writes this to a Jew and Gentile church.

1024
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,940
 He says, "But you are a chosen people,

1025
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,060
 a royal priesthood, a holy nation,

1026
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,740
 a people belonging to God that you might declare."

1027
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,740
 Notice this, "You are a holy people.

1028
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,660
 You've been chosen by God.

1029
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,600
 You are a holy people.

1030
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,600
 You are a nation of priests, so that you might declare."

1031
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,780
 You have a calling and mission.

1032
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,300
 "So that you might declare," what he says here is,

1033
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,900
 "The light of God.

1034
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,300
 You would declare the praises of him

1035
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,780
 who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

1036
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,300
 That you would be a mouthpiece, a voice piece

1037
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,740
 for the incredible work that God does

1038
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,660
 in and through us as people."

1039
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,900
 This, my friends, is who you are.

1040
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,300
 You wanna know what your calling is?

1041
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,480
 To be a priest, to be holy,

1042
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,180
 so that you can declare the praises of him

1043
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,540
 who's called you out of darkness into his glory light.

1044
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,420
 You know what you should be dedicating your life to?

1045
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,980
 So that you could be a priest and you could be holy

1046
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,060
 so that you could call out of the darkness

1047
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,540
 the light of God and give him praise for who you are.

1048
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,580
 That's his invitation to you.

1049
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,220
 Are you with me?

1050
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,620
 If that doesn't inspire you, I don't know what will.

1051
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,500
 Like if that doesn't set your heart on fire,

1052
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,340
 if that doesn't recalibrate how you think about work,

1053
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,420
 if that doesn't change the way that you think

1054
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,780
 when you go into the office tomorrow

1055
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,220
 or when you raise your kids

1056
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,140
 or when you think about your marriage

1057
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,740
 or you think about your future,

1058
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,660
 if this idea of being God's mouthpiece

1059
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,660
 and his voice and his heart to being in the world

1060
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,940
 but not of it, to bring hope where there is no hope,

1061
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,500
 if that doesn't inspire you, I don't know what will

1062
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,660
 'cause this is the gospel.

1063
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,660
 If Exodus had finished at chapter 19,

1064
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,180
 we wouldn't have gotten any of that.

1065
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,140
 We would've just come to know him.

1066
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:04,140
 But Exodus 19 onwards is God now saying, get to know you.

1067
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,260
 What we're gonna be doing over the next number of weeks

1068
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,700
 here at the Vine is helping you to live

1069
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,860
 in the freedom that God has given you, amen.

1070
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,780
 Could you stand?

1071
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,020
 I'd love to pray for you.

1072
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:24,820
 Father, we're just so grateful for the men, women,

1073
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,380
 children and families that are here in this moment.

1074
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:33,060
 And Father, we stand before you as a chosen people.

1075
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,900
 We stand before you as a royal priesthood,

1076
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,500
 as a holy people.

1077
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,860
 Sometimes we don't feel that way.

1078
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,300
 If we're honest, sometimes we don't act that way.

1079
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,300
 It's very easy in our slavery to sin,

1080
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,980
 to discount who it is that we've actually

1081
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,060
 been created to be.

1082
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,780
 And so a free Israel comes to Mount Sinai

1083
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,500
 and God appears and he says, now the real journey begins.

1084
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,820
 (gentle music)

1085
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,180
 It's so important that we understand

1086
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,100
 that in the story of Exodus,

1087
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,660
 it's not just a story of God's power

1088
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,180
 in delivering a people without freedom.

1089
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,860
 It's a story of God's power in reviving a people

1090
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,980
 without identity.

1091
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,580
 And some of you in this room,

1092
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:27,060
 you're a Christian, you love Jesus.

1093
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,420
 He saved you, you're free,

1094
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,380
 but you struggle to know who you truly are.

1095
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,460
 And if that's you, I wanna encourage you this morning

1096
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,780
 just to receive from him.

1097
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,180
 Receive his presence with you.

1098
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,020
 Receive his voice over you.

1099
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,380
 You have value.

1100
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,700
 And your sin and your brokenness is stripped

1101
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,380
 so much of how you see yourself, but you have value.

1102
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,820
 I see you as a priest.

1103
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,540
 I see you as the very one that can mediate

1104
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,940
 between the world and God.

1105
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,340
 Some of you need to know,

1106
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,060
 I feel this for this service in particular,

1107
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,420
 some of you in this room,

1108
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,180
 because of the slavery of sin that you've been in,

1109
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,900
 you felt anything but holy.

1110
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,180
 And we're gonna learn next week a lot more

1111
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,620
 about what holiness really is.

1112
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,860
 And I'm unpack that for you next week,

1113
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,300
 but right now in this moment,

1114
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,740
 some of you just need to know you are holy.

1115
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,460
 You need to know that that's how God sees you.

1116
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,740
 That's the identity he brings to you.

1117
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:36,060
 That in his presence,

1118
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,860
 we are washed clean, we are holy.

1119
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,420
 I feel like the enemy has stolen that thought

1120
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,900
 from some of you in this room.

1121
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,220
 And because of that, you've held back in your decisions

1122
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,420
 and your dreams and your hopes.

1123
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,100
 You felt like God could never really use me

1124
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,060
 because of X, Y, and Z in my past.

1125
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,700
 Israel comes to Mount Sinai

1126
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,460
 with all of that baggage of their past,

1127
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,340
 and God is about to tell them who they truly are.

1128
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,380
 And I pray in this moment

1129
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,740
 and over the next number of weeks,

1130
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,660
 you will hear who it is that you are.

1131
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,740
 And for some of you in this room,

1132
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,380
 God is saying, it's time to go.

1133
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,180
 Perhaps you know who you are,

1134
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,380
 but for whatever reason,

1135
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,300
 you've kind of camped at Mount Sinai.

1136
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,260
 It's really important.

1137
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,820
 Israel was at Mount Sinai for one year,

1138
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,780
 a long time, 'cause they needed to know who they were,

1139
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,700
 but they weren't camped at Mount Sinai forever.

1140
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,580
 Some of you, you're always seeking

1141
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,980
 the mountaintop experience,

1142
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,580
 and that's important in seasons of our life.

1143
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,300
 But for some of you, it's time to come down the mountain,

1144
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,460
 and it's time to get into the valley,

1145
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,140
 and it's time to see the goodness of the Lord

1146
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,100
 in the land of the living,

1147
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,220
 not just on the top of the mountain.

1148
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,740
 Some of you are receiving a calling today to go.

1149
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,060
 Holy Spirit, whatever it might be for whoever here,

1150
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,180
 I just pray that you would come.

1151
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,660
 Maybe just open your hands if you're comfortable.

1152
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,500
 I'm just gonna invite the team

1153
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,020
 to come and just worship over us.

1154
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,260
 And as they worship over us,

1155
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,900
 just allow yourself to be ministered to

1156
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,580
 in whatever way that God wants to speak to you today.

1157
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,160
 (gentle music)

1158
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,200
