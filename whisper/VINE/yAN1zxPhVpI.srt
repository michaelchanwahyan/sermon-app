00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
 So recently I was invited to speak at the annual retreat of a large international nonprofit organization.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,360
 I was honored to be invited.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,120
 I was so excited to gather with this group of people overseas and take them through what I sense God had put on my heart.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,720
 I was invited to be the only speaker of the retreat.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,040
 It was over four days.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,000
 There were six main sessions that I was to bring content into.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,040
 And I remember being pretty nervous.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,240
 It was one of my first times to be overseas and speak.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:37,640
 And I was just really so prepared to bring what I sense God had put on my heart and felt so deeply honored to be able to do this for this group of people.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,920
 And I remember sitting there in the very first session.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,280
 I'm sitting on the front row.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,840
 I'm going through my notes.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,800
 I'm drastically trying to build the confidence in my heart to stand in front of this room that's packed full of all these people.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,760
 And the CEO of the organization, he gets up onto the platform to introduce me, to welcome me to the conference.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,080
 And here's what he says.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:05,960
 He goes, "Unfortunately, the person that I really wanted to be here to speak at this retreat couldn't make it this year.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,720
 So I'm grateful that Pastor Andrew Gardner from the Vine Church in Hong Kong can be with us today."

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,480
 I mean, can you imagine it, right?

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:26,080
 I'm sitting there and I've been introduced in lots of different ways throughout some 20 years of preaching, but I've never been introduced as the clear second choice.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,600
 And so I'm sitting there and all that inspiration and all that hope and encouragement is just drained from me.

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,640
 I'm suddenly feeling like I'm weighing like 400 kilograms.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,400
 I like trudge up to the platform for my opening speech and I get in front of all these people.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,040
 And here's what comes out of my mouth.

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,360
 I say, "Hey, everyone, I'm plan B.

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,280
 No one likes to be second A.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,560
 I mean, none of us train hard for the silver medal, right?

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,320
 Like second is the great amnesia of history.

28
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:04,720
 No one ever remembers who didn't win the prize, who didn't get the cup, who wasn't the one who actually succeeded.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,400
 The reason why we don't like second is because second reminds us that somebody else did better.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
 Somebody else performed more.

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,760
 Somebody else was more desired than us.

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,520
 When we're in second, it hurts our ego.

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,000
 It hurts who we are.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,840
 And it's an uncomfortable place to be.

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:29,040
 And so I think as humanity, we do everything we can to try to avoid the nastiness of being in second place.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,000
 The reality is, I think we do this in our churches.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,640
 I think so much of the Christian faith is so often from the pulpit shaped around this idea that as Christians, we never have to worry about second place.

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,320
 No, as Christians, we get to be first, don't we?

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,000
 Yes, we do.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
 We're victorious.

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
 We're the overcomers.

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:54,560
 Oh, we use words like we're the chosen and we get to go to heaven, the ultimate first place prize.

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:07,360
 And the reality is when we push ourselves into this idea that we should be in first place, we actually have to stop for a second and realize that we completely missed the point of Christianity.

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
 But yes, it's true.

45
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,320
 As Christians, we will be victorious.

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,880
 We will rise again.

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,600
 We will be at some point with our heavenly father.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,720
 Those things are amazing.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,440
 They're the great promises of our faith.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,560
 But here's the irony and the beauty of the Christian faith.

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,760
 We actually win by losing.

52
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:40,800
 We actually win by actually being way second place, by giving up ourselves, by laying our crowns down, by actually picking up our cross and denying ourselves.

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,360
 You will never get to where God wants you with a desire to be in first place.

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,480
 Here's the reality.

55
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,000
 First place has always been and will always be reserved for Jesus.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,520
 He is the one who is victorious.

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,040
 He is first.

58
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
 We are second.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,680
 See, this desire to be first has always been the antithesis of the gospel.

60
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,520
 It's a desire that kicked Satan out of heaven.

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,480
 It's one of the temptations that Satan brings Jesus in the wilderness.

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,760
 The desire to be first overcame the disciples as Jesus gained in popularity.

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,520
 And they said to him, "Who's going to sit at your right hand and sit at your left hand in glory?"

64
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,960
 The desire to be first, I think, has crushed the global church over almost 2000 years of history.

65
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,400
 And it's created so many problems in leadership.

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
 And here's the reality.

67
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,760
 Here's the reason why.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,240
 The attributes of first are things like glory and power and authority and worship.

69
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,160
 Things that are rightly for Jesus.

70
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,320
 And here's the thing.

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:05:01,920
 As humanity places itself in a position of first, when we try to grab a hold of attributes like power and authority and glory, we get so easily seduced by them.

72
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,520
 They corrupt us.

73
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,360
 They corrupt our hearts because these are attributes that are reserved for Jesus.

74
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,040
 The desire for first is the antithesis of the gospel.

75
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,480
 The desire to be second is fitting and deserving of it.

76
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,120
 Because the idea of being second is the idea of some of the great themes that we see in the gospels.

77
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,520
 The idea of humility.

78
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,880
 The idea of honesty.

79
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,840
 The idea of serving the other.

80
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,560
 The idea of loving your neighbor as yourself.

81
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,640
 The idea of realizing that there is somebody else who is as important, more important, more needful, more anointed.

82
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,120
 That somebody else gets my life.

83
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,200
 I can pour myself out towards them.

84
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,280
 Christmas is the celebration that humanity gets to be second.

85
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,640
 Because Christmas is all about the idea that Jesus comes.

86
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,600
 That Jesus himself comes to model and to demonstrate what the Christian life looks like.

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,960
 As we look at the beauty of the birth of Jesus.

88
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,680
 I love how the apostle Paul brings it to us in Philippians chapter 2.

89
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,040
 Paul says this, that even Jesus, the rightful one to be first, didn't hold being equal with God something to be grasped.

90
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,320
 But instead, Jesus humbled himself.

91
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,520
 That Jesus came in the incarnation as a human.

92
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,640
 That he was willing to take off that power and that authority and lay it down.

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,080
 Why?

94
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,000
 So he could serve us.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,440
 And what Jesus does in his life, in his death, in his resurrection, is models for us what it is to be in that place of second.

96
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,640
 Everything Jesus did was to honor the reality of where we are to be.

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:55,560
 And it blows my mind that the one who should be first chose the posture of being second to lead us out of the desire to be first into a place of second.

98
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,680
 So that he could be truly glorified.

99
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,040
 I hope you're following that.

100
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
 Let me say it this way.

101
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,920
 One of the beautiful ways that I think Jesus models to us what it is to be in second place.

102
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,080
 Is that Jesus shows us what it is to be a follower.

103
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,040
 A follower is the beauty of second place.

104
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,280
 Jesus, throughout his ministry, would say this.

105
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,960
 He says, "I can't say anything unless my father tells me to say it.

106
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,120
 I won't go anywhere unless my father leads me there."

107
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,040
 Jesus's whole ministry was about listening to his father and being obedient to what his father was saying.

108
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,560
 Because he was humbling, modeling something of what it is to be a follower.

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,800
 And this is so beautiful.

110
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,400
 It's Jesus consciously and deliberately demonstrated to us the art of what it is to be a follower.

111
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,240
 And I call it an art because it's not a science.

112
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,160
 Following after something is an art.

113
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,120
 It's an expression of creativity.

114
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,080
 It's individual.

115
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,480
 It fills our own experience.

116
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,040
 Following someone takes practice.

117
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,680
 It's a sacrifice in order to do so.

118
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,560
 We have to constantly fight that ego and that pride that would want to put us in front.

119
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,360
 Being a follower enables us to put Jesus in that rightful place.

120
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,920
 The beauty of being able to do that establishes for us something of the centrality of the kingdom of God.

121
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:32,280
 That the foundation of everything we do comes from the idea that we get to follow Jesus.

122
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,560
 You know, I always think of it this way.

123
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,120
 I think following is like the undercoat of the kingdom of God.

124
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,680
 It's like that first piece that's put on that canvas by an artist.

125
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,160
 And he's going to paint over it many, many times.

126
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:54,400
 But the ultimate color at the end only shines so deep and so beautiful because of the undercoat that was first placed on the canvas.

127
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,480
 Our following, our welcome into what it is to follow Jesus is the undercoat of God's kingdom.

128
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,720
 It's the foundation of everything.

129
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,960
 And it's exactly what John the Baptist does in the final movement of his ministry.

130
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,120
 We trace these movements that he's been doing throughout our Advent time.

131
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,720
 We've looked at that first movement of calling people to repentance.

132
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,120
 The second movement of welcoming them to the desert place where they could meet with God.

133
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,000
 The third movement, as we saw last week, of being invited into the waters of baptism.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,440
 And the ultimate experience of the washing of the Holy Spirit in the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

135
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,000
 And now, right at the end of his life, right towards the end of his ministry, John does the final thing.

136
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,480
 He releases the crowds to follow Jesus.

137
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,760
 John ultimately says, "I must decrease, He must increase."

138
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:01,200
 Advent, if it's anything, is about the idea of preparing ourselves to truly follow Jesus.

139
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,320
 And I want to show you some ways in which I think John invites us into being followers of Jesus today.

140
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,440
 And you may have been a follower of Christ for many years.

141
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,240
 Maybe like me, you've been a follower of Christ since you were pretty young.

142
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,400
 Or maybe this is a new experience for you.

143
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:25,440
 Wherever we are, I think so often we end up finding ourselves slipping back into the centrality of the world.

144
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
 Where we become the focus.

145
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,080
 And Jesus is like this deity on the shelf that we turn to in times of need.

146
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,000
 May I challenge you today that we need to learn what it is to follow Jesus again.

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
 Let me read this to us from John chapter 1.

148
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
 I'm going to start in verse 29.

149
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,560
 "The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him.

150
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,520
 And he said this, 'Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.

151
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,600
 This is the one I meant when I said,

152
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,400
 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.

153
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,840
 I myself did not know him.

154
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,840
 But the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.'

155
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,400
 Then John gave this testimony.

156
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,720
 'I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.

157
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,920
 I would not have known him except for the fact that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me this,

158
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,160
 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'

159
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,920
 So I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God."

160
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,840
 Take a moment to think about the context here.

161
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,960
 This is just probably a day or two after John has actually baptized Jesus in the Jordan River.

162
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,480
 That baptism has taken place.

163
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,280
 And now John realizes that the final movement of his ministry

164
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,640
 is to try to release all the disciples that had gathered around him.

165
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,800
 Because John had become popular.

166
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,960
 John's message had gone out to the people.

167
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,760
 They were excited that the Messiah was about to come.

168
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,960
 And here's John now saying, "Okay, I don't need all of this.

169
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,280
 I'm not to be in that place of first.

170
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,800
 If you're following me, you're in trouble.

171
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
 No, no, I need to release you."

172
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,320
 And so as he sees Jesus walk past on this one day,

173
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,680
 he shouts out with his whole voice in front of all these people.

174
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
 "Look, look, there's the Lamb of God.

175
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,040
 Like right here.

176
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,080
 This is the one who's going to take away the sins of the world.

177
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,520
 I'm not that one.

178
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,400
 This is the one."

179
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,680
 I love this.

180
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
 He says, "Look, there is the Lamb of God."

181
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,760
 Now that phrase, the Lamb of God, it's actually only used here in John's ministry

182
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,280
 and also in the book of Revelation.

183
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,560
 But it's actually not very prominent in the New Testament as a whole.

184
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,960
 And the question we should ask ourselves is,

185
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,040
 why is John using that particular phrase in this moment?

186
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,560
 Well, he's drawing from beautiful Old Testament imagery.

187
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,440
 The whole imagery of the Passover.

188
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,840
 In the Passover, where they slaughtered the lambs

189
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,360
 and the Jewish people who were enslaved in Egypt

190
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,280
 took the blood from the lambs and put it on their doorposts on their walls

191
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,480
 so that the angel of death would not come across their door

192
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,600
 so that anybody in that household would be protected.

193
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,280
 And here's John, how many years later,

194
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,040
 and he's pointing at Jesus and he's saying,

195
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,520
 "This is the new Passover right here.

196
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,240
 This is the one whose blood will need to be shed."

197
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,840
 By calling him the Lamb of God, right at the start of Jesus's ministry,

198
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,000
 John is declaring that he's going to die.

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,760
 I mean, that's what lambs were for.

200
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,480
 They were for sacrifice to be slaughtered.

201
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,440
 And here's John saying, "This is the one who's going to be slaughtered

202
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,640
 so that all of the sins of the world will be forgiven.

203
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,640
 No longer would it just be blood over the walls and the doors for the Jewish people."

204
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,960
 Notice, he says, "For all the world."

205
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,120
 Like everybody, Jews and Gentiles alike will come to have their sins forgiven

206
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,720
 because of this one.

207
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,240
 Look, there is the Lamb of God.

208
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,400
 And I think that's so powerful and so beautiful

209
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,200
 that we can remember that he forgives our sins,

210
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,760
 that he can release these things from us,

211
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,520
 that we get to follow him.

212
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,400
 And John says in verse 30, he says it this way.

213
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,640
 He goes, "This is the one that I meant when I said,

214
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,160
 'A man comes after me who has surpassed me because he was before me.'"

215
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,240
 This is classic John.

216
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,280
 I mean, imagine if you said that,

217
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,360
 "This is the one who's after me before me because he was before me."

218
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
 Like, this doesn't make sense.

219
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,480
 Like, what are you talking about, John?

220
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
 This is like, you can imagine his disciples going like,

221
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
 "Did he eat too many locusts today?"

222
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
 Like, dude, chill out.

223
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,200
 Like, what you, I don't get what's going on right now, right?

224
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,600
 Here's what John's saying.

225
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,360
 He's saying, "Jesus is first always.

226
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
 He was before me.

227
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
 He's going to be after me.

228
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,240
 He surpasses me.

229
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,960
 I get to be a follower of the Lamb of God,

230
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,840
 the one who forgives my sin."

231
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,320
 This one right here.

232
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,680
 Jesus' ministry was to point out the Lamb of God,

233
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,320
 to show people the way to Jesus.

234
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,120
 And I don't know about you,

235
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,520
 but I find that incredibly challenging at this time of the year.

236
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,280
 As I see Christmas just coming up on Friday of this week,

237
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,160
 I'm thinking to myself,

238
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,480
 "Am I pointing people towards Jesus?"

239
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,760
 Like, does my life, the things I say, the way I act, who I am,

240
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,000
 does it make space for the reality

241
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,160
 where I'm trying to lead my sphere of influence

242
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,640
 to the place where their sins can be forgiven?

243
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,080
 Am I an evangelist?

244
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,040
 Am I pointing out to people that this is the Lamb of God?

245
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,560
 This is deeply challenging,

246
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,480
 'cause I want to be honest about it.

247
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,800
 I think so often as Christians,

248
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,320
 we might have this idea that Jesus is the Lamb of God,

249
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,720
 but we're not really pointing towards him.

250
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,920
 In fact, most of our lives are actually pointing

251
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,960
 in the opposite direction.

252
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,120
 Rather than saying, "Look, the Lamb of God."

253
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
 Here's what I think we often end up saying,

254
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,600
 "Look, the servant of God."

255
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,840
 And we put ourselves once again in that first place.

256
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,680
 If Advent is anything,

257
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,560
 if Advent is this call to us

258
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,960
 to prepare ourselves for the coming of Jesus,

259
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,680
 both individually and as a community,

260
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,200
 we must ask ourselves, "Who are we pointing towards?

261
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,720
 Who is getting my focus?"

262
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,480
 And I wanna invite you to reflect on that right here

263
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
 in the middle of this message.

264
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,840
 I want you to take a moment now to ask yourself,

265
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,680
 "Is my life really pointing to Jesus?

266
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,120
 I mean, is he really my focus point right now?

267
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,760
 Or am I actually kind of pointing towards myself?

268
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,920
 Or I'm pointing towards my career?

269
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,080
 Or I'm pointing towards this job that I have?

270
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,400
 Or I'm pointing towards something else in my life?

271
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,800
 Or I'm pointing towards my social media that's about me?

272
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,480
 I'm pointing, whatever it might be,

273
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,240
 we find ourselves pointing in lots of different directions.

274
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,240
 But are we releasing people through our lifestyle,

275
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
 through our words and our actions and our voice?

276
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
 Are we releasing people to follow the Lamb of God?

277
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,320
 Or are we inviting people to celebrate the servant of God?

278
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,320
 May I open your hearts to this thought right now.

279
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,080
 And the way we're gonna do that is in a moment,

280
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,360
 I'm just gonna invite the worship team.

281
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,840
 They're gonna come and actually lead us in a song.

282
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840
 And this song won't be too familiar to you.

283
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,720
 It'll probably be new.

284
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,800
 And I wanna encourage you to read the lyrics.

285
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,360
 It's a song that celebrates this power

286
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,280
 that is in the name of Jesus.

287
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,840
 This idea of the King being kings,

288
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,160
 that he is one that's seated on the throne.

289
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,240
 It's a song that celebrates pointing to the Lamb of God.

290
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,440
 And so as you reflect on this,

291
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,480
 as you listen to the song,

292
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,680
 as you allow the lyrics to take heart in yourself,

293
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,840
 allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you.

294
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
 And if there's any way that he shows you

295
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,080
 that you haven't been pointing in the right direction,

296
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,120
 just in the beautiful kindness of his presence,

297
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,400
 bring it to him.

298
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,600
 And after we finish this song,

299
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,720
 I'm gonna come back to us

300
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,160
 and I'm gonna show us what happens

301
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,280

 Let's take a look at what happens next in our story

329
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,400
 as John continues to release people to Jesus.

330
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,360
 I'm gonna pick it up in verse 35.

331
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,920
 "The next day, John was there again with two of his disciples.

332
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,600
 When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, 'Look, the Lamb of God!'

333
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,240
 When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.

334
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,800
 Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, 'What is it that you want?'

335
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,600
 They said, 'Rabbi,'" which means teacher,

336
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,440
 "'Where are you staying?'

337
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,320
 'Come,' he replied, 'and you will see.'

338
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,680
 So they went and saw where he was staying and spent that day with him.

339
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,040
 It was about the 10th hour."

340
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,120
 I love this.

341
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,680
 This is the next moment in the narrative.

342
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,520
 And it says right again, "The next day,"

343
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,040
 so immediately after what we had just been talking about before,

344
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,840
 here's John and he sees Jesus again in the crowds.

345
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,440
 And he once again shouts out and points out, "Here is the Lamb of God!"

346
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,320
 But something different takes place this time.

347
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,800
 Two, just two, but two of John's disciples

348
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,320
 who'd been with John the whole time,

349
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,800
 who had seen John and admired John

350
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,720
 and modeled their lives after John,

351
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,080
 who had followed him,

352
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,520
 are then aware that this one is the Lamb of God,

353
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,240
 that this one is the one who is about to take the sin from the world.

354
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,800
 And so they leave John and they begin to walk in his direction.

355
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,200
 They begin to come towards him, to follow after him.

356
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,280
 And it seems like such a small thing in the text,

357
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,200
 but it actually is so much.

358
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,240
 It's actually so powerful.

359
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,080
 These are the first two disciples of Jesus.

360
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,680
 And it challenges me because here's the thought.

361
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,520
 See, I think we can very easily be people

362
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,640
 who can point out that Jesus is the Lamb of God

363
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,920
 and yet fail to actually follow him ourselves.

364
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,400
 I think one of the dangers of the church,

365
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,440
 I'm gonna be really honest,

366
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
 I think one of the dangers of the church

367
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,640
 is that we can be filled with people who sing about the Lamb of God

368
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,080
 and yet fail to truly follow him.

369
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,720
 And what can end up happening,

370
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,600
 particularly I would say in a church like the Vine sometimes,

371
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
 is that people can end up following a brand,

372
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
 following a church,

373
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,720
 following a speaker or a leader,

374
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,440
 and not actually following Jesus.

375
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,560
 If there's something we are completely about here at the Vine

376
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,920
 is that we must decrease, he must increase.

377
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,400
 That we must be less, he must be more.

378
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,160
 That is the whole beauty of the Christmas story,

379
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,480
 that in the incarnation one comes,

380
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,800
 who takes that power and authority

381
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,520
 and all the thing that can seduce and corrupt us

382
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,360
 and brings it to someone else,

383
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,720
 where we can stand back and go,

384
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,800
 "There's the Lamb of God,"

385
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,640
 and actually follow him,

386
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,960
 be released to give our lives to him.

387
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,040
 I mean, what a joy that is.

388
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,000
 What a gift that, my friends, is the heart of the gospel.

389
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,160
 Notice what happens when we follow after Jesus.

390
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,720
 It says in verse 38,

391
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,760
 "Turning around, Jesus saw them following him,

392
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,920
 and he asked them, 'What do you want?'"

393
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,680
 I love this.

394
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,440
 This is classic Jesus, right?

395
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,240
 So there's Jesus just going about his normal day, right?

396
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,320
 And he's got a couple of dudes following him now.

397
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,520
 And he's like, "Have you ever been in like Ikea?"

398
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,560
 I've done this many times.

399
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,200
 It drives me nuts.

400
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,280
 You're in Ikea, there's hundreds of people around you,

401
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,800
 and you're walking and you turn left,

402
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,160
 and then some people turn left with you,

403
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,800
 and you turn right,

404
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,920
 and some people turn right with you,

405
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,960
 and you want to turn around and go,

406
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,000
 "What do you want?"

407
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,880
 Like, "What's going on?"

408
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,200
 This is like the classic Hong Kong crowd thing.

409
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,560
 Here's Jesus.

410
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,280
 Got two people for the first time following him.

411
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,080
 And he turns around.

412
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,560
 When you read it in English, it's like almost Jesus is like,

413
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,120
 "What do you want? Why are you following me?"

414
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,440
 It's beautiful.

415
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,520
 Actually, in the Greek, if you read it, it says it more like this.

416
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,280
 "What is on your heart?"

417
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,040
 Isn't that cool?

418
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,560
 Like in the English, it's like, "What do you want?"

419
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,600
 But in the Greek, it's more, "What is on your heart?"

420
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,520
 In other words, Jesus turns to these two people,

421
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,960
 and he says, "Why are you following me?

422
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
 What is your desire?

423
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,080
 What are you trying to seek?

424
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,800
 What is ultimately in your heart?"

425
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,520
 It's a powerful question.

426
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,320
 It welcomes us into a different place.

427
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,520
 It reminds us that following Jesus

428
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,760
 is not about Jesus walking ahead of us,

429
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,800
 and us just trying to diligently kind of walk in his footsteps,

430
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,040
 like we're trying to be perfect like Jesus.

431
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,480
 Following Jesus is a relationship.

432
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
 Following Jesus is a dialogue.

433
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,200
 It's a community.

434
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,040
 It's a chance to actually commune with the creator of all things.

435
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,040
 When we follow Jesus, we're not distant to him,

436
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
 trying to keep up with him.

437
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,840
 We're walking alongside with him.

438
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,800
 In fact, actually, the Greek word for following here

439
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,360
 means actually to journey on a path

440
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,000
 or to go on a path with someone.

441
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,840
 So you're walking almost alongside of Jesus.

442
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,720
 And there's this kind of dialogue that you're having with him.

443
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,480
 That's the beauty and the simplicity of what it is to follow Jesus.

444
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,160
 If you want to know just basically what does it mean to follow Jesus,

445
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,160
 it means to live your life in dialogue with the creator of the universe,

446
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,040
 to have a conversation with him,

447
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,240
 to listen to him, to hear him, to ask of him.

448
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,720
 And here are these two disciples that Jesus turns to in this moment,

449
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,880
 and he says, "What is on your heart?"

450
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,160
 Imagine if Jesus turned to you right now and said those words to you.

451
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,680
 What is on your heart?

452
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,560
 How would you respond?

453
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,280
 Maybe you might say, "All right, yeah, I've got a question for you, God.

454
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,640
 I want to ask you, why is it that bad people always seem to get the good stuff?"

455
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,600
 Or maybe you might ask, "Yeah, God, why is it that when I pray sometimes,

456
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,760
 it feels like my prayers don't get unanswered?"

457
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,960
 Or maybe you'd want to ask, "Why does bad stuff happen to good people?"

458
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,480
 You know, like there's a whole bunch of questions that we might have on our hearts.

459
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,800
 If God turned to us and said, "What is on your heart?"

460
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,720
 And I want you to hear what these two disciples respond with.

461
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,440
 Could have asked anything of the creator of the universe.

462
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,320
 Here's what they say.

463
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:43,280
 In verse 38, they say this, they say, "Rabbi," which means teacher, "Where are you staying?"

464
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,280
 Like, where are you staying today?

465
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,160
 Because we want to come and be with you.

466
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,360
 We want to just spend our time with you.

467
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,280
 We want to sit in your presence.

468
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,800
 We want to be with you.

469
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,520
 If you want to know what following Jesus essentially is, it is exactly that.

470
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,120
 It is discovering where Jesus is in your life and spending time with him.

471
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,920
 Just desiring to be present with him, wanting to walk side by side with him,

472
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,400
 wanting to be in the very places in our city where he is.

473
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,800
 The invitation of their hearts is to say, "You're the lamb of God.

474
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,360
 You're the one who's going to take the sin away from the world.

475
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
 You're the one who's rightfully first.

476
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,960
 All power and authority and majesty and glory is yours.

477
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,720
 We just want to be with you."

478
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,400
 That heart cry of being a follower of Jesus is as simple as that.

479
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,520
 You don't have to be learned.

480
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
 You don't have to be excellent.

481
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,160
 You don't have to be perfect.

482
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,560
 You just have to carry that desire that says, "God, I just want to be with you.

483
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,440
 I want to know you.

484
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,240
 I want to hear you.

485
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
 I want to sense your presence with me.

486
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,120
 I want to see what it is that you're up to.

487
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,720
 Would you lead?

488
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,240
 I want to follow.

489
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,680
 Would you reveal?

490
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,520
 I want to see.

491
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,480
 Would you tell me?

492
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,920
 Because I want to learn."

493
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,440
 It's a dialogue and a community with the creator of the world.

494
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,520
 I mean, what could be better than that?

495
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,960
 And I love how Jesus responds to them.

496
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,760
 He says this.

497
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,840
 He says, "Come," He replied, "and you will see."

498
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,920
 Think about this for a sec.

499
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,240
 What is on your heart?

500
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,640
 We want to know where you're staying.

501
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,240
 You want to be with me?

502
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,280
 Come then, and you will see.

503
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:37,200
 Jesus invites them to not only be with Him, but to see the things that He is about to do.

504
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,320
 And I think this is so profound.

505
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,240
 If there is a sentence that sums up all of Advent, where Advent is about the idea that

506
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,160
 I get to come to be with Jesus, that I get to come to prepare myself for the coming of Jesus.

507
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,440
 That's what Advent is all about.

508
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,760
 Here's Jesus turning Advent around, and He's saying, "You know what Advent is for Him?

509
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,120
 It's for Him to say, 'Come to me.

510
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,680
 You come to me, and I will show you what I'm up to.'"

511
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,920
 Jesus stands over your workplace, and He says, "Come, and you will see."

512
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,080
 He stands over your marriage, and He says, "Come, and you will see."

513
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,760
 He stands over those relationships that are broken in your life right now, and He's saying,

514
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,680
 "Come, and you will see."

515
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:31,120
 He stands over your pain and your hurt of 2020, and He says, "Come, and you will see."

516
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:37,760
 He's present in the worst places, in the places that are the hardest to find.

517
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,600
 He's present in every aspect of our city, and He's crying out to us, and He's saying,

518
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
 "Come, and you will see.

519
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,880
 I will show you what I'm doing in all the places where you thought I was absent.

520
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,520
 Emmanuel, God with us."

521
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,080
 This is the Christmas message church.

522
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,760
 This is the shepherds in the fields hearing the angels say, "Come, and you will see."

523
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,000
 This is the magi wondering what is ahead of them, following a star that's telling them,

524
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,840
 "Come, and you will see."

525
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,640
 Christmas is the manger that says to the world, "Come, and you will see."

526
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:24,240
 Where is it in your life that you want to see the activity of Jesus?

527
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,280
 You're called not for first place.

528
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,840
 You're called not to increase, but decrease.

529
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,960
 You're called to that great and glorious gift of following after Jesus,

530
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,800
 and in doing so, being in dialogue and community with Him,

531
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:50,640
 wondering in your heart where He is, and then in the miracle of faith, seeing Him show it to you.

532
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,800
 Him saying those words, "Come, and you will see."

533
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,520
 Where for you do those words resonate most today?

534
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,680
 Where as you prepare your heart for Christmas on Friday,

535
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,880
 are you longing to see Jesus the most?

536
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,120
 That's what I encourage you to bring your prayer to today.

537
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,960
 As we finish our time in this series, as we finish Advent,

538
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,360
 as we get ready to celebrate Jesus's birth on Christmas day,

539
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,040
 we do so from that posture of following after Him, hungry to see Him,

540
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:33,040
 revealed more in Christmas in 2020 than He has ever been in any time of history.

541
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,880
 Maranatha, come Lord Jesus.

542
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,960
 Let me pray for us.

543
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,520
 Let's pray.

544
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,160
 Father, for whoever is listening to this right now,

545
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,880
 where this is a word in season for them,

546
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,400
 maybe some who are listening have put themselves in the place of first,

547
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,320
 where they've been saying more, "Look the servant of God,"

548
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,240
 rather than, "Look the Lamb of God."

549
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,760
 Lord, if that's the reality for any of us,

550
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,360
 thank you that we can bring that to you in this moment.

551
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,240
 Thank you that you love us, you forgive us, and you release us, Lord.

552
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,720
 And so we come in that place of repentance as we've spoken about every week.

553
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,920
 We ask you now to wash us clean again, Lord.

554
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:23,040
 If we've allowed ego and pride to center the universe around ourselves,

555
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,160
 would you forgive us, Lord?

556
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,160
 And may we take on that mantle of John the Baptist today.

557
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,600
 And may our lives point people to seeing Jesus.

558
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,200
 May we decrease, may Jesus increase.

559
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,640
 Or maybe you've been listening to this today,

560
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,560
 and for you, in all of the things that have happened this year,

561
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,760
 and all the stuff,

562
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,720
 maybe you need to get that fire again in your heart that says to the Lord,

563
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,240
 "God, I want to follow you.

564
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,000
 I want to just be where you are.

565
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,480
 And I realize I've been distracted by so many things, but it's simple.

566
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,040
 I just want to follow you, Lord.

567
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,640
 I want to be in conversation with you.

568
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,320
 I want to have dialogue with you again.

569
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,560
 I want to hear your words spoken after me.

570
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,280
 Show me where you are, Lord."

571
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,120
 And for some of you today, those words are a great encouragement to you.

572
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,880
 Come and you will see.

573
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,320
 And wherever it might be that you're looking for a breakthrough,

574
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,240
 wherever it might be that you're desiring for more of Him,

575
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,200
 hear the word spoken by the Spirit over you.

576
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
 Come and you will see.

577
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,440
 Lord Jesus, for anyone here who's listening to this right now,

578
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,680
 I want to pray that that would be a reality for them this Christmas.

579
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,360
 That you would show them where you're staying in their businesses,

580
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,480
 in their marriages, in their families, in their relationships,

581
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,320
 in the places of healing they need,

582
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,280
 and all of the things that are going on that are stressing them.

583
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,480
 Would you reveal the power of your glory to them?

584
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,280
 And would you show yourself new and afresh this Christmas?

585
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:05,360
 And we pray this together in Jesus' name, Amen.
