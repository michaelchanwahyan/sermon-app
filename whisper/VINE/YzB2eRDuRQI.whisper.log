[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340]   Amen, awesome.
[00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.000]   All right, so I'm not gonna do that for everybody.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.860]   Don't worry, we're good.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.240]   I know that every time I get into the pulpit
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.040]   here at the Vine, I get super excited
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.900]   and I often will say to you, I'm so excited today.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.560]   But I am genuinely really excited today
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.780]   for what I think the Lord wants to do in us in this moment,
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.160]   for what I think He wants to do in the weeks ahead
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.500]   as we start a new sermon series here today.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.620]   I wanna teach actually over the next four weeks with you
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.420]   on the topic of personal transformation.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.180]   And I'm really excited about this
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.560]   because I don't know how you feel
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.720]   as you've come into church today, as you've joined us online,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.280]   whether you feel like life is the best
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.980]   that it's ever been for you,
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.640]   or whether you feel like there's pain and trauma
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.100]   and there's some sort of thing
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.600]   that's kind of a suffering in your life,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.960]   whether you're feeling great or you're really struggling,
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.600]   the weight of Scripture would show us
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.020]   that one of the primary functions of the ministry of Jesus
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.500]   is to take us from who we are today
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.000]   and to move us to become more and more like Him.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.300]   At the very heart of what is the ministry of Jesus,
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.560]   both the scriptural ministry,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.220]   but also the ministry of Christ in the world today
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.760]   through the power of His presence and His Spirit
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.140]   is to take us from the people that we are right now
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.620]   and help us to become more a reflection of Him
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.640]   in the world around us.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.720]   In other words, God's primary focus of His heart as a Father
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.680]   and the Spirit's primary work in your life
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.480]   and Jesus's primary focus
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.440]   is to help this transformation process happen in you
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.800]   so that you can begin to be the very person
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.320]   that He longs for you to be.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.720]   And so none of you have come into church today by mistake.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.400]   I believe none of you watching online
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.960]   in the overflow in this room right now,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.680]   none of you are here just for an event.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.640]   You are here because there is something in your life
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.360]   that the Lord wants to touch, wants to liberate,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.000]   wants to heal, wants to restore.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   There's something in you that He wants to move His Spirit over
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.160]   and do such a renewal and a restoration work
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.540]   that you would feel like you've become the person
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.380]   that you're designed to be.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.880]   If you're anything like me,
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.160]   you can recognize that there are some areas in your life
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.480]   that you wish were healed, restored, renewed,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.840]   that you wish you were a better person.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.920]   And I believe that over the next four weeks,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.800]   God is gonna drop into your spirit some of the keys,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.120]   some of the ways in which you can grow and transform
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.360]   and become that person that He longs to be.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.920]   That's why I'm excited today.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.500]   And this all links back to what we shared with you
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.440]   at Vision Sunday here at The Vine in March.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.320]   If you've been coming to The Vine for a while
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.160]   at the beginning of March, every year,
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.760]   we share a Vision Sunday where we tell you
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.880]   about the sense that we have as a leadership
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.320]   about God's heart for us as a church community.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.160]   And back then we mentioned
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.440]   that we are in an uncharted territory season,
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.640]   that the Lord is wanting to move The Vine
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.240]   into uncharted territory.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.880]   And what we explained to you about on that first Sunday
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.160]   in March is that this is always the call of the Lord
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.920]   when He wants to do something significantly new
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.840]   amongst His people.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.960]   Uncharted territory is literally territory
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.160]   where we have no map, we've never been there before,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.880]   there is no idea or strategy for what it is,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.320]   but God wants to take us from where we are today
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.840]   and He wants to place us where we've never been before.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.720]   And when we're in this season of uncharted territory,
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.760]   it's an adventure, it's a joy,
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.400]   but it's also kind of scary
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.200]   because we don't know how to define it.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.040]   We don't know exactly what it's gonna look like,
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   we don't know exactly how it's gonna happen
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.880]   and what God does in a season of uncharted territory
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.120]   is He calls us to faith, He calls us to trust Him.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.440]   Because there isn't a strategy, there aren't resources,
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.680]   there isn't the map to know where it is that we're going,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.840]   but we have this sense that He wants to take us there.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.160]   And I feel like for some of you in this room,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.560]   in this journey of personal transformation,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.600]   that resonates with you.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.800]   It's like, you're like, I wanna be different,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.280]   I wanna be better, I wanna be more wise,
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.120]   I wanna be more Christ-centered,
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.000]   I wanna be more compassionate,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.560]   I wanna have breakthroughs in my work,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.920]   I wanna just be a better human being.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.320]   You're kind of feeling it in your spirit,
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.000]   but it's uncharted.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.400]   You're not sure where it's going to go,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.640]   but God say, don't worry, I've got you.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   And I'm gonna come and I'm gonna work in your life
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.280]   and gently step by step,
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.080]   you're gonna transform and be renewed
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.760]   into something truly beautiful.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.880]   And at that Vision Sunday,
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.280]   I shared with you a word that the Lord had given me
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.680]   whilst I was in the Camino de Santiago in Spain,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.600]   this pilgrimage last year that I did on my sabbatical.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.480]   And as I was walking in Spain,
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.400]   God gave me a word for us as a community and as a church.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.120]   I wrote it down here on this very piece of paper.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.680]   And I read this to us back in March,
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.880]   but I wanna read it again,
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.360]   because this is still the season we're in.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.600]   And as we move to the second half of the year now,
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.680]   this is still a thing that resonates on his heart
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.400]   for us, so let me read this to us.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.240]   It says this,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.920]   "I am about to move the vine into uncharted territory.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.120]   I desire to take you to places you have never been,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.920]   to stretch you beyond what you're currently comfortable with.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.400]   These are uncharted territories,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.160]   and they are necessary for your faith and my work.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.880]   You do not have the strategy, resources, gifts,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.120]   or wisdom for what is coming.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.800]   That is not the issue.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.480]   All you need to begin is faith and courage."
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.320]   Let me just stop there.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.640]   "All you need to begin is not the answer,
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.800]   is not how everything's gonna pan out,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.400]   is not how everything's gonna look at the end of it all.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.280]   All you need right now," the Lord is saying,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   "is faith and courage."
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.320]   Father, I wanna pray faith and courage
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.800]   into the vine community.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.800]   Lord, I wanna pray that you would fill the people
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.280]   in this room with a greater faith and courage
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.200]   for their personal transformation.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.400]   I wanna pray, Lord,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.800]   that you would put such faith inside of them,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.480]   that every day they would wake up and say,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.240]   "I know that today is gonna be better
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.400]   than what's been behind.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.720]   I know that the Lord is with me,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.400]   and if he is with me, who can be against me?"
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.280]   Lord, I pray for a release of courage amongst your people.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.240]   In Jesus' name, everyone says.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.480]   So all you need to begin is faith and courage.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.320]   This is about complete trust in me.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.080]   What I will give you, though, is a burden.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.960]   I will give you a new heart.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.440]   I will make you unsatisfied for the here and now.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.480]   I will place my hand upon you
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.800]   and stir up the joy of the pursuit of me.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.040]   I'm not calling you to a vision with knowledge
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.320]   of all that is ahead.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.120]   No, this is uncharted territory.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.360]   What I am calling you to is a value,
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.680]   the value of complete and total surrender,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.480]   a holy dissatisfaction in the way things have been,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.160]   and a passionate longing for the discovery of more.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.880]   And then I wrote in brackets just below it,
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.640]   "Preach on this sometime."
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.680]   But I love this because that statement there
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.560]   is really the summary, if you will,
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.680]   of what personal transformation is all about.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   This is how it begins, a holy dissatisfaction
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.680]   in how things currently are,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   and a longing and a faith and a courage that there's more,
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.600]   that there's more for me, there's more for my future,
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.040]   there's more for who I am,
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.880]   there's more depths of Christ
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.400]   that the Lord wants to open up for me,
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.120]   there's more compassion that he wants to place within me.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.600]   I'm not the final product today,
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.960]   and God has given me a new heart,
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.320]   a new burden to seek and be on my knees
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.720]   and to pray and believe that greater will be ahead of me
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   what has been behind me.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.240]   And this is the starting point of any journey
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.520]   of personal transformation, a burden for change.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.680]   And what I wanna do today and over the next four weeks
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.880]   is unpack a little bit about what this burden
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.360]   for change in us looks like,
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.440]   and some of the keys by which we can take that burden
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.400]   and truly live it out in our lives.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.240]   Interestingly, over the last six months,
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.280]   I've been praying this exact passage,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.120]   this exact group of God's word over us, for us.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.280]   And as I've been praying it,
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.040]   he led me about four months ago
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.600]   to the Old Testament book of Ezra.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.520]   Now, I don't know if you've ever read the book of Ezra before
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.360]   or if you've ever heard anyone preach
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.440]   from the book of Ezra before,
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.160]   but the book of Ezra is this significant book
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.480]   in the narrative of the Old Testament.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.600]   It happens about sort of three quarters of the way
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.640]   through the Old Testament in terms of its chronology,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.480]   but the book of Ezra narrates and chronicles
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.280]   a significant time in Israel's history,
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.680]   a turning point in their history,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.280]   what you might call an uncharted season in their history.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.160]   It's the time where Israel is released
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.360]   from their captivity in exile in Babylon
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.880]   and are brought back to their city of Jerusalem,
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   the city that had been destroyed
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.520]   by the Babylonians some 70 years earlier.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.040]   So the book of Ezra captures for us the moment
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.680]   where God's people are released
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.900]   and they're able to go back to their city,
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.900]   which has been desolated from the attacks 70 years before.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.960]   And one of the things that you see in this book
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.200]   is exactly how Israel faces this work
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.440]   of rebuilding in their lives.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.020]   And as we're thinking about what it is
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.440]   for us to be transformed,
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.160]   what does it look for the Lord to come
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.600]   and do a rebuilding in us?
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.560]   As we start the series,
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.960]   I wanna give you that historical context
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.800]   so you fully understand what we're teaching into
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.280]   in the moment of Israel's history.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.460]   So let me just give you a bit of historical context,
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.380]   really important about humans in general,
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.200]   but also the nation of Israel.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.800]   About sort of 800, 900 years before the birth of Christ,
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.640]   Israel that time was a confederacy of 12 tribes.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.440]   And those 12 tribes were held together by a judge.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.240]   And those judges were raised up
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.720]   and the judge could come from any of the 12 tribes in Israel.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.300]   And the judge was anointed to lead the people at that time.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.800]   Now, interestingly, over time,
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.200]   God's people decided that they no longer wanted
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.880]   to be just a confederacy of 12 tribes,
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   they wanted to be a monarchy like other nations around them.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.420]   They looked at some of the other nations
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.400]   that were around them at the time
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.240]   and they saw kings and queens
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.120]   and the power that came from a kingship.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   And so they came to the judge at the time
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.480]   who happened to be Samuel.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.320]   And they said to Samuel,
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.680]   "We want you not to pass on the judge to the next judge,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.240]   we want you now to anoint a king for us."
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.820]   So sure enough, God decides to work through Israel this way.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.900]   And so Israel goes from a confederacy to a monarchy,
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.420]   a nation with a king,
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.260]   Saul the first king, the second King David.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.580]   Now what happens interestingly,
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.500]   is that when you're a confederacy with 12 tribes,
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.120]   anybody from one of those 12 tribes could become judge.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.780]   When you become a monarchy,
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.180]   monarchy is passed down through bloodline.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.300]   Now, a lot of people in Israel didn't realize
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.380]   that that was gonna happen.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.380]   And suddenly they don't like the monarchy thing anymore.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.060]   They don't like the fact that power gets passed down
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.700]   through one family's bloodline.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.300]   And in fact, out of the 12 tribes,
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.820]   10 of them decide to rebel against the other two
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.580]   and actually leave Jerusalem
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.580]   where they were all based at this time and go north.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.700]   Go north to the area of like the West Bank
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.880]   as we understand it today,
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.400]   and parts of Southern Lebanon, that sort of area of land.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.140]   The 10 tribes go there and they establish a new nation
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.340]   with a new monarchy of the bloodline they wanted.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.620]   Now, here's the confusing thing.
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.940]   When the 10 go north, they decide to rename themselves Israel
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.380]   which is really not helpful for us
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.560]   when we're reading the Bible
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.340]   because there's the Israel of original,
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.180]   but now there's this new Israel
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.940]   of the 10 tribes that have gone north.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.420]   Now, two of the tribes remain south in Jerusalem,
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.620]   Benjamin and Judah, and they rename themselves Judah.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.060]   So now you've got Israel and you've got Judah.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.900]   And if you're reading the books of like Nehemiah and Ezra
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.580]   and Zachariah, Jeremiah, these kinds of books,
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.760]   when they mention Israel, when they mention Judah,
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.600]   that's what they're talking about,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.540]   the 10 tribes north or the two tribes south.
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.700]   Making sense so far?
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.820]   Okay, now here's what happens in 722 BC.
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.980]   Assyria comes and attacks the 10 tribes that had gone north.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.100]   Assyria comes down from the north, attacks the tribes,
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.840]   and basically intermarries with many of the Jewish women
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.100]   and kills the majority of the Jewish men.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.720]   And what happens is the offspring that is born
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.940]   from these Gentile Jewish relationships
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.060]   and the new offspring that are born
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.940]   would come later on in the narrative in the New Testament
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.860]   in Jesus' time to be known as the Samaritans.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.140]   Have you ever wondered why in Jesus' day
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.940]   the Jewish people hated the Samaritans so much?
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.700]   It's because they were half-Breeze.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.220]   They were half Assyrians, half Jewish people.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.820]   And because of the ugliness of that,
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.900]   they rejected the Samaritans.
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.820]   But Jesus, of course, himself goes and ministers,
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.300]   and that's a whole nother sermon series
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.940]   but we're not gonna go there now.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.200]   But I want you just to follow the history.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.220]   So Assyria comes down, attacks, intermarries.
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.460]   Now, the two tribes that remain south in Jerusalem,
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.940]   for a while they do okay, but in 605 BC,
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.940]   then Babylon comes in from the east and attacks Jerusalem.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.020]   And Babylon tears down the walls of Jerusalem,
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.780]   most importantly, destroy the temple,
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.980]   the first temple in Jerusalem, destroy the temple,
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.420]   kill many of those two tribes,
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.180]   but takes a remnant of God's people
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.660]   and brings them back into captivity in Babylon.
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.420]   And so for 70 years, the Jewish people
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.220]   are in captivity in Babylon,
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.020]   wondering if they're ever going to be able to return
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.440]   back to their beloved city of Jerusalem,
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.540]   even though it lies in ruins.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.340]   Well, God then raises up another nation, Persia,
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.100]   and Persia comes in from the east of Babylon,
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.460]   attacks Babylon.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.900]   There's basically a lot of attacking that's happening.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.340]   Have you seen the Lego people coming
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.620]   and swarming on the Lego people?
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.660]   So Assyria comes, attacks,
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.380]   and they have a different foreign policy.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.540]   In their foreign policy,
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.420]   they realize that there are Jewish people
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.940]   in captivity in Babylon, but their home is Jerusalem.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.020]   So King Cyrus of Persia allows, gives permission
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.300]   for the Jewish people to finally return home.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.660]   The Jewish people go back in three waves,
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.780]   each under the leadership of an individual
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.860]   with a specific purpose.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.980]   The first wave is under a leader called Zerubbabel,
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.220]   and they rebuild the wall, sorry, the temple.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.380]   He has permission to rebuild the temple.
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.060]   The second wave is under the leadership of Nehemiah,
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.060]   and he and those around him rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.380]   The third wave is under the leadership of Ezra,
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.560]   and Ezra's role is to reestablish the law,
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.380]   to get the law back up and running for God's people.
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.920]   So with these three waves, the temple gets rebuilt,
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.460]   the walls get reestablished,
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.000]   and the law gets established in the hearts of the people.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.220]   Now, here's the really confusing thing.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.260]   The book of Ezra, you would think,
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.500]   was all about the reestablishment of the law,
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.420]   but that actually is chronicled for us
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.700]   in the book of Nehemiah.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.260]   Yes, I know.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.980]   The book of Ezra, funnily enough,
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.540]   the first half of Ezra speaks about the restoration
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.580]   and rebuilding of the temple.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.180]   So it's Zerubbabel,
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.020]   but it's written through Ezra's perspective.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.820]   And particularly, once you get to chapter three of Ezra,
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.160]   you see this incredible moment
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.860]   where Ezra describes all of Israel
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.780]   gathered back in Jerusalem,
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.500]   and they're standing with their feet
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.540]   in the ruins of the old temple.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.280]   And as they're standing with their feet
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.540]   in the ruins of the old temple,
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.380]   they begin to build the new temple
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.720]   out of the rubble of the old.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.140]   Are you still with me?
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.260]   Now, when I read this a number of months ago,
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.660]   praying for you and praying for myself,
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.980]   something leapt in my spirit
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.760]   and something shifted in me.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.620]   And I realized that that moment of Israel
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.380]   standing in the rubble of the old
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.100]   to begin the process of building the new
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.800]   resonated deeply with me.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.720]   'Cause I don't know about you,
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.900]   but I can see that there's still a lot of rubble in my life.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.260]   I know that there are still some things in my life
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.520]   that lays in ruins.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.260]   Some things that I've struggled with
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.300]   for the majority of my life.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.080]   Maybe situations in my past
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.340]   that has created some trauma for me.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.860]   Relationships that didn't work out.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.860]   Insecurities is something that I've spoken to you guys
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.900]   a lot about over the years of leadership here.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.540]   Insecurities that I've struggled to deal with
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.900]   and struggled to shake.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.700]   When I look at my life,
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.500]   yeah, I'm a pastor of a church,
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.980]   but I can see that there are still things
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.180]   laying in ruins within myself,
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.740]   within my identity, within my confidence,
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.300]   within the way I see myself.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.540]   There's rubble there.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.340]   I'm not the way that I long to be.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.440]   And I wonder if that resonates
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.160]   with any of you here this morning.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.000]   I wonder if you think about your life for a moment,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.920]   you would be honest and say,
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.960]   "There's some stuff lying in ruins in me too."
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.360]   There's some rubble here as well, Andrew.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.000]   Some things that I've struggled with.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.120]   Some trauma of my past,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.680]   decisions I made that didn't work out.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.520]   Things that hurt me.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.980]   Maybe people did other things that hurt me.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.680]   Maybe sin that I've struggled to get rid of
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.720]   and I'm living in the consequences of that reality.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.160]   I think if we're all honest with ourselves,
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.880]   we would all resonate with this thought
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.920]   that there's still rubble here.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.380]   Rubble of the old, rubble of the past.
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.980]   And it still seems to be that we're standing
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.800]   in the reality of that rubble.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.560]   And if that resonates with you,
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.820]   the next four weeks is gonna be
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.080]   incredibly exciting for you.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.740]   I believe incredibly exciting for me
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.060]   'cause I think there are some keys and some tools
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.840]   that are gonna help each one of us
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.520]   rebuild from the rubble.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.200]   And so what I wanna do here this morning
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.520]   is I wanna read this passage
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.840]   that we're gonna be looking at over these four weeks.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.080]   It starts in verse 10 of chapter three
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.200]   and it goes all the way to verse five of chapter four.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.560]   And then we're gonna jump in
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.120]   and just look at the first couple of verses
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.560]   in our time together here this morning.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.000]   Is this okay, everyone?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.320]   You guys all right?
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.160]   All right, cool.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.000]   Let me read Ezra 3 verse 10.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.480]   When the builders laid the foundation
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.900]   of the temple of the Lord,
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.440]   the priests in their vestments and with their trumpets
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.260]   and the Levites, the son of Aspha with symbols,
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.600]   took their place to praise the Lord
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.080]   as prescribed by David, King of Israel.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.160]   With the praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord,
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.600]   He is good for His love endures forever.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.960]   And all the people gathered
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.680]   with a great shout of praise to the Lord
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.240]   because the foundation of the house of the Lord
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.700]   was being laid.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.120]   But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.360]   who had seen the former temple,
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.880]   wept aloud when they saw the foundation
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.020]   of the new temple, the second temple being laid.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.520]   While many others shouted for joy.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.080]   No one could distinguish the sounds of shouts for joy
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.600]   from the sound of weeping
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.000]   because the people made so much noise
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.640]   and the sound was heard from far away.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.880]   When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.600]   that the exiles were building a temple for the Lord,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.280]   the God of Israel, they came to Zerubbabel
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.480]   and to the heads of the families and said,
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.680]   let us help you build because like you, we seek your God
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.780]   and have been sacrificing to Him since the time of Escherdon,
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.300]   the King of Assyria, who brought us here.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.180]   But Zerubbabel, and you can almost certainly hear
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.300]   with the fire and the passion of the Lord within him
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.020]   and Jeshua and the rest of the heads
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.860]   of the families of Israel answered,
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.900]   you will have no part with us
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.220]   in building a temple to our God,
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.940]   for we alone will build it for the Lord,
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.220]   the God of Israel, as King Cyrus,
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.620]   the King of Persia has commanded us.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.660]   Then the peoples around them set out
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.840]   to discourage the people of Judah
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.380]   and make them afraid to go on building the temple.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.620]   They hired counselors to work against them
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.900]   and frustrate their plans during the entire reign
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.780]   of Cyrus, King of Persia,
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.420]   down to the reign of Darius, King of Persia.
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.900]   So there's this idea that God has anointed them
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.740]   for this project of rebuilding.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.020]   There's resistance against that project.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.220]   Zerubbabel stands firm and he says,
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.340]   mm-mm, we're not gonna listen to your voice.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.380]   We're gonna stand firm on this in the Lord.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.540]   And but throughout the whole time of rebuilding,
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.580]   there are people around saying,
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.640]   this is never going to amount to anything.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.020]   I wonder if you've ever had somebody in your life
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.140]   that no matter how excited you are,
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.820]   no matter how much you're excited about the future,
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.000]   no matter how bubbly you might be,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.940]   they're the naysayer and the voice of doom in your life.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.700]   And that's not gonna happen.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.060]   You don't have the resources.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.180]   You don't have the network.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.180]   You don't have the friends.
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.380]   Have you seen yourself lately?
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.900]   We've all got these people in our lives
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.500]   that are trying to tell us that we cannot do
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.940]   the very thing that the Lord has said we can do.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.260]   Any process of personal transformation
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.180]   is gonna have to wrestle with the naysayers and the doubters.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.620]   And here's what happens.
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.300]   They're not always external.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.900]   Sometimes they're internal.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.380]   Now notice what happens at the start.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.740]   When the builders laid the foundation
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.620]   of the temple of the Lord.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.700]   Let's just stop there.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.100]   Ezra begins this beautiful moment,
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.900]   this significant historical moment
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.420]   of the building of the second temple.
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.260]   And he says, here's the reality.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.420]   At the moment we're standing there,
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.960]   our feet are still in the ruins of the old temple.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.260]   Our feet are in the rubble of the old,
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.260]   but then the builders come
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.340]   and the builders begin the process of restoration.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.820]   What I love what Ezra does here,
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.380]   and you can see Nehemiah doing something similar
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.140]   in his description of this event as well.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.960]   They're not shying away from the reality
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.100]   that their glorious Jerusalem is now lying in ruins.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.940]   In fact, we see this more profoundly,
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.220]   I think, in the book of Nehemiah.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.460]   So let me just jump to Nehemiah 4, verse two.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.460]   Let me read this to you.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.940]   It says this, in the presence of his associates
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.100]   in the army of Samaria, he said,
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.980]   what are these feeble Jews doing?
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.020]   This is another one of those naysaying voices.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.980]   Will they restore their wall?
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.700]   Will they offer sacrifices in a temple?
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.740]   Will they finish in a day?
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.300]   Can they bring the stones back to life
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.460]   from those heaps of rubble, burned as they are?
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.340]   So I want you to see the actual picture
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.860]   of Jerusalem in this moment.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.500]   And the naysayers describe it and Nehemiah captures it.
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.740]   They're literally standing in the ruins.
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:11.740]   It's literally like so bad that the stones are so burnt,
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.020]   so broken up, so desecrated,
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.460]   that the enemies are taunting Israel.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.780]   And they're saying, have you not seen the stones?
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.980]   Don't you realize that there is nothing
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.380]   that can come from this?
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.500]   How could life ever come from these stones
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.100]   as burnt out as they are?
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.620]   And what I love about what Ezra is doing in chapter three
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.460]   is he's not hiding from the reality
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.760]   that the stones are burnt.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.900]   He's not trying to cover up the reality
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.060]   that Jerusalem is desolate at this time.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.180]   He's not trying to pretend
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.980]   that things are better than they are.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.060]   He's not trying to sweep the issues under the rug.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.900]   He's not trying to say that,
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.980]   hey, we just need a fresh thinking about what the,
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.420]   no, he's actually going, okay, we are standing here.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.420]   And yes, the stones, they're burnt out, they're broken.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.020]   He's like, this has to be our starting point.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.180]   And I think what we see here is a profound first idea
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.660]   when we think about our own journeys
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.800]   of personal transformation.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.660]   It's always going to begin when we take a good,
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.140]   honest, and sober look and admit and acknowledge
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.420]   what lies in ruins in our life.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:27.220]   No one has ever changed until they've realized
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.680]   that they need to change.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.020]   And so here's a moment where Ezra is not trying
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.620]   to sweep it all under the rug.
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.380]   He's putting out that Nehemiah,
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.900]   letting us know what those stones actually look like,
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.140]   burnt and broken.
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.020]   And they're doing it 'cause they're trying to say,
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.540]   that's the beginning point.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.560]   And if you want to change,
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.620]   if you want the Lord to do something in your life,
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.340]   it is going to start when you realize, you know what?
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.760]   I admit there's some ruins in me.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.860]   I admit that there are some areas of rubble
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.820]   that I wish they weren't there, but they are there.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.140]   I'm struggling with the reality that this is here.
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.340]   Notice this, you will never become the person
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.340]   God longs you to be until you first actually wrestle
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.340]   with who you are and understand and own the person
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.700]   that you are today.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.900]   You're never gonna become the person
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.820]   that God longs for you to be until you first take
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.100]   that understanding and that ownership of who you are today,
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.740]   putting your hand up in your spirit and in your heart
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.180]   before the Lord, maybe doing it before others
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.260]   in your small group community and saying, I'm struggling.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.420]   I mean, it's hard.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.740]   I got some trauma I'm struggling to shake.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.420]   I got some sin that I can't seem to deal with.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.040]   I got some insecurities that are still present,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.700]   whatever it might be for you.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.620]   Our starting point is, this is honestly
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.900]   what's going on in my life.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.380]   This is who I am.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.700]   I'm not hiding from it.
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.420]   I'm not trying to run from it.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.380]   I'm not trying to pretend that it's not there.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.180]   I'm not coming in on Sunday, raising my hands
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.140]   and singing these great songs for Jesus
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.860]   and then doing all the things I'm doing in the week.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.020]   No, eventually I have to lay the line in the sand
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.900]   and say, there's rubble here.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.380]   There's rubble here.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.580]   There's things laying in ruins and it's not right.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.620]   And I want the Lord to change me 'cause I've got a burden.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:23.540]   I've got a longing inside of me, a holy dissatisfaction
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.260]   for the way that I am and I longing for more.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.940]   That's where it begins.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.980]   That's where it begins in this moment right here
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:36.260]   for God's people standing in the rubble of their life.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.540]   And as they're standing there and they're realizing
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.540]   that this is the starting point,
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.900]   just to acknowledge the reality that there is rubble there,
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.420]   I want you to see what happens next.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.980]   This is so important.
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.220]   They come to realize something
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.620]   and they come to make a decision.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:56.620]   They realize that God's renewal always begins in the rubble.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.460]   God's renewal always begins in the rubble.
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.260]   And so if step one is to say, I can see some places
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.980]   in my life where there's ruin and rubble,
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:10.540]   step two is to go and that's the playground of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.300]   Like the ruins and the rubble is where God
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.580]   gets most excited.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.620]   The stuff that's broken in me, if his primary focus
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.220]   is to move us to become more and more like Christ Jesus,
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:26.060]   he sees the rubble inside of me and he gets excited
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.900]   for the change that's coming.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.140]   You see, God looks at the rubble in your life
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.940]   and he's not repelled or repulsed by it.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.940]   Instead he rejoices and he rolls up his sleeves.
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.300]   He looks over you and he says,
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.220]   okay, I can see some stuff you're struggling with.
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.400]   I know things are hard, I know this is challenging,
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.660]   but I see you and I see the person you're becoming.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.420]   And I'm so excited that I can draw alongside of you.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.380]   I'm not repelled by that brokenness.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.620]   I'm not repelled by the rubble around you.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.540]   No, the rubble is my playground.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.460]   The rubble is the very place that I take and transform.
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.180]   Notice this, Israel does not see the rubble
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.340]   and the burnt out stones, get rid of them all
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.820]   and then bring in some other stones.
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.580]   They take those stones and they lay the foundation
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.020]   of the new temple.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.580]   It's the same with Jesus.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:19.900]   He takes the rubble of our lives and he doesn't go,
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.820]   away it goes.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:26.460]   He takes the rubble and he restores and renews it.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.380]   The very thing that we thought could never come to any good
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.900]   comes good so that he receives the glory.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.380]   And with an enemy are taunting Israel,
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.020]   have you seen the stones?
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.460]   Don't you realize that nothing good can come from that?
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.980]   Burned as they are, Israel had to make a choice.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.380]   They had to make a choice 'cause they could see the stones,
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.340]   same as everybody else.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.500]   Their choice was, are they going to see the stones,
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.740]   agree with the taunters and say, you know what?
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.620]   I don't think anything good can come with it.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.820]   Or were they gonna see the stones and say,
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.620]   hang on a sec, sure, I can see how burned out they are,
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.540]   but that's just the possibility then
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.740]   for God to do an even greater miracle.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.380]   That's just therefore the way for God to come
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.620]   and restore and renew in ways that we can never do.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.300]   Are they going to choose to go with the enemy's voice
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.540]   or are they gonna choose to go with a voice of faith?
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.500]   And every single one of us,
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.260]   if we want any transformation in Jesus Christ,
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.940]   we are always gonna come to the same decision point.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.420]   Some of you, I know I do this.
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.060]   I look at some of the brokenness in me and I think,
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.740]   I don't think God could ever do anything with that.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.460]   And immediately I'm operating from a place of defeat.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.820]   I have to make a decision.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.260]   Do I really believe that the rubble is the Lord's playground?
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.580]   Do I really believe that what I thought burnt as it is
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.620]   could never come to anything good,
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.940]   that if God touches it, it can come to life?
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.820]   Jesus, as the widow comes out of the village of Nain
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.940]   with her dead son in a casket, touches the casket,
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.220]   and he says, "Arise."
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.500]   Do I believe that the Spirit of God can touch the rubble
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.900]   that lays ruin in me and stay alive?
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.420]   It's a challenge.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.980]   It's a challenge because it's easy for us to, I think,
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.380]   listen to the rubble than it is to stand in faith
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.220]   with the Lord.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:26.540]   Some of you need to realize that when you look at the rubble
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.980]   of your past and you just see failure,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.900]   God looks at that rubble and he sees your good future.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.460]   What you think is the rubble of your past,
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.820]   God sees as the building blocks of your future.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.060]   He sees the very thing that he can't wait to do
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.540]   in your life, the very thing that he seeks
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.220]   to transform and renew.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.020]   He sees the rubble, but he sees it and rejoices.
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.460]   He rolls up his sleeves and he's like,
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.100]   "Do you wanna get to work?"
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.500]   The question we should have is then,
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.420]   "Yeah, I think I do, Andrew, but I don't know how.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.940]   "Like, how do we start?
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.940]   "What is the starting posture of my heart?
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.000]   "How do I resonate to what you're saying here today?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.260]   "It's resonating, but how do I move forward?
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.780]   "What is my starting point?"
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.180]   Well, I want you to see what happens in verse 10 and 11 here.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.300]   It says this, it says,
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.660]   "When the builders laid the foundation
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.500]   "of the temple of the Lord,
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.460]   "the priests in their vestments and with trumpets,
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.980]   "and the Levites, the son of Asher with their symbols,
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.260]   "took their places to praise the Lord
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.340]   "as described by David, king of Israel.
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.360]   "With praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord,
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.100]   "'He is good, his love to Israel endures forever.'
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.580]   "And all the people gave a great shout of praise
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.480]   "to the Lord because the foundation
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.140]   "of the house of the Lord was made."
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.000]   This should blow your mind 'cause it blows mine.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.900]   As they're standing in the rubble,
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.140]   and as the first builders begin to take that rubble
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.100]   and begin to construct the new temple,
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.380]   here's what we see Israel doing.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.540]   They're worshiping, they're praising,
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.900]   they're clashing symbols together,
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.180]   they're jumping up and down, they're shouting for joy,
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.860]   they're making so much noise
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.420]   that it's heard from far and far away.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.580]   Israel's having a worship dance party
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.040]   whilst they're surrounded by rubble.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.160]   Now, I don't know about you,
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   when I'm aware of the rubble in my life,
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.160]   I don't feel like a worship dance party.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.160]   In fact, when the rubble is in my life,
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.560]   when the ruins, I mean, I'm aware of them
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.120]   and I'm soberly seeing them,
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.880]   I wanna run in the other direction, I wanna get away.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.360]   I don't want someone clashing symbols around me
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.960]   and going, "Praise Jesus."
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.840]   I wanna run to a cave and escape.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.980]   Anyone with me?
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.880]   Like we have this kind of averse thing,
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.440]   like we're in the rubble,
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.480]   the last thing we think is to praise,
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.880]   here's Israel in the rubble and they're finding a voice.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.600]   I'll tell you what,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.040]   when I'm aware of the pain of my rubble,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.440]   there are words coming out of my mouth,
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.680]   but you would not wanna hear them on a Sunday.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.840]   But here's Israel, great as our God,
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.480]   singing away, clashing the symbols,
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.800]   having a party as the temple's being rebuilt.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.640]   And this should really challenge you
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.720]   because here's the thing,
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.180]   as Christians, our primary posture in worship
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.540]   is to worship as a response to something God has done
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.420]   rather than at the beginning of something
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.340]   we're hoping Him to do.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.660]   Come on church.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.220]   Like as Christians, largely,
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.660]   we find worship rising up inside of us
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.940]   because the prayer was answered,
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.940]   because the thing we had hoped for did happen,
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.340]   because the healing that we needed came through.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.620]   And when those things happen,
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.540]   we stand back and we go, "God is awesome.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.820]   "God is great."
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.240]   And so often as Christians,
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.300]   I think we base our worship in a retrospective,
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.560]   a reactive thing rather than a proactive thing.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.160]   And trust me, when God heals you,
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.180]   when He does something, you should worship.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.520]   You should respond in praise.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.640]   You should respond in a hallelujah and in glory.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   That's an absolutely right thing to do.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.080]   But when our primary posture with worship
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.460]   is always in response to what God is doing,
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.840]   then we're standing there waiting for God to do something
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.080]   before we give Him glory.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.320]   When actually maybe we need to begin
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.720]   to think of worship differently.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.120]   Maybe there's another kind of worship,
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.640]   I would argue one that is way more rare,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.920]   but one that is way more powerful,
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.400]   the kind of worship that says,
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.080]   "I'm gonna praise Him long before He does
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.240]   "anything I've asked Him to do."
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.400]   Long before He's come through,
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.720]   long before the healing, long before the restoration,
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.840]   long before the temple is built,
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.200]   we're gonna start the process.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.600]   The process, whilst we're still with our feet in the rubble,
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.080]   we're not gonna allow the rubble to speak louder to us
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.320]   than our faith within us.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.840]   No, this is the time where we're going to praise Him.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.840]   We're making a decision to praise right at the start.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.660]   Why?
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.880]   Because we're not praising in response,
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.200]   we're praising prophetically.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.760]   We're praising, asking, expecting, hoping,
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.000]   and seeing that we know the Lord's gonna do.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.280]   He's gonna do something with this rubble.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.320]   We don't know what it's gonna do.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.600]   We don't know how the temple's gonna look.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.880]   It could look as good as the first one.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.180]   It could look different than the first one.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.380]   That's not the big issue here.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:08.200]   The big issue is God is at work.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.080]   And the way I respond to God being at work
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.240]   is to allow my hallelujah to come out.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.360]   This kind of worship is a weapon.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.520]   This is the kind of worship that takes the walls of Jericho
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.240]   and pulls them down to rubble,
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.400]   and then takes the rubble of Jerusalem
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.680]   and rebuilds a glorious city with the name of Jesus.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.320]   That's worship.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.200]   And that's where these people are,
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.620]   and they begin to give this exclamation of the worship.
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.440]   Now, notice what is the content of their worship.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.480]   This is powerful.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.200]   Verse 11, "With praise and thanksgiving,
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.440]   they sang to the Lord, 'He is good.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.600]   His love endures forever.'"
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.800]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.740]   That's not the content of my worship in that situation.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.980]   You wanna know what the content of my worship would be?
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.000]   Lord, I praise you
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.040]   because you're gonna build a great temple, right?
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.880]   Like, I praise you
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.800]   because you're gonna make Israel great again.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.320]   I praise you because our name is gonna be feared
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.220]   by all the Gentiles around the world again.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.060]   I praise you.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.900]   In other words, so often our worship
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.500]   is essentially taking our kind of our prayer wish lists
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.700]   and putting music to it, right?
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.380]   Like all the things that we want God to do for us.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.740]   This is why we resonate sometimes
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.820]   with certain worship songs.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.740]   Have you ever noticed, and this is the thing to do,
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.140]   have you ever noticed that some of the worship songs
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.580]   that you resonate to, you resonate to
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.340]   because they speak of a God doing something
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.540]   that you want God to do for you?
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.820]   And so our worship becomes like our prayers.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.660]   Oh God, would you do this?
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.480]   Would you do this?
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.820]   Oh God, we worship you because you're gonna do this.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.660]   You're gonna do this.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.320]   You're right, you're gonna do this, right?
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.280]   You did it before, you're gonna do it again.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.980]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.060]   And we begin to align our worship
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.060]   to what we're asking God to do.
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.540]   And when God doesn't do it, what happens to our worship?
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.780]   Israel does not stand before the Lord and say,
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:52.740]   "We're worshiping you
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.260]   because of what we're expecting you to do with the temple."
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.100]   They stand before the Lord and they say,
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.780]   "Our worship is not based on what you're going to do.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.460]   It's not based on our circumstance.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.100]   It's not based on our expectation.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.800]   Our worship is simply based
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.220]   in your character and your nature."
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.780]   You are good, they say.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.700]   They say, "We don't know what our future is,
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.780]   but we do know you are good.
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.660]   We don't know what's gonna happen down the line,
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.020]   but we do know you are good.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.500]   And we're gonna base our worship
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.300]   in your character and your nature.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:24.260]   We're gonna praise character over circumstance
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.320]   'cause our circumstance,
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.300]   we're surrounded by a bunch of rubble that lays in ruins,
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.420]   but we're gonna go with character over circumstance.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.420]   We're gonna go with God's nature
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.740]   rather than the world's narrative."
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.380]   He is good, they say.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:42.740]   His love endures forever.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.640]   Man, I don't know if God's gonna heal me of my insecurities
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.740]   that I've wrestled with for so many years,
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.340]   but I do know He is good.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.540]   I don't know if He's gonna answer all the prayers
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.540]   that I'm praying for in certain areas of my life
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.340]   the way that I want Him to answer it,
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.220]   but I do know that He is good.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.020]   I don't know if He's gonna heal your cancer,
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.700]   but I do know He is good.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.180]   I don't know if He's gonna provide that great job
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.300]   that you're hoping for, but I do know that He is good.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.160]   I don't know if He's gonna restore and repair your marriage,
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.780]   but I do know that He is good.
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.580]   And here's what happens when we shift our worship
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.300]   away from retroactive, from what has happened
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.780]   to what we are looking for in the future,
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.740]   as we shift the perspective of our worship,
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.340]   and as we shift from circumstance to the nature of God,
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.620]   everything around us begins to change.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.840]   You need to understand that in the Christian life,
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.100]   the journey of personal transformation
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.660]   actually happens and takes place
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:39.060]   not when we see a change in our circumstance,
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.300]   but when we see a change in our perspective,
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.060]   not in terms of how we see the world,
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.060]   but in terms of how we see God.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.520]   I guarantee you, you will start to personally transform
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.180]   when you see God differently.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.540]   See, when you see God as good,
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:57.220]   that changes how you need to see everything else.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.500]   If that is your primary thing,
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.580]   everything else around you has to shift and change.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:03.800]   Or think of it this way,
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.960]   when your divine perspective shifts,
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.980]   then your temporal reality will always be reframed.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.940]   When we say He is good,
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.800]   everything around us begins to shift
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.880]   in the light of the declaration that He is good.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.680]   When we say that He is the one,
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.800]   everything else has to fall in line to that,
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.820]   even though the circumstance might be trying to tell us,
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.060]   "Hey, these stones can't live.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.560]   Look at how burnt out they are."
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.820]   No, no, He is good.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.620]   So I don't know what's gonna happen to those prayers.
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.980]   I don't know what's gonna happen to my cancer.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.420]   I don't know what's gonna happen to whatever it might be
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.260]   that I'm wrestling with in my life, but here's what,
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.020]   I'm reframing what I think about it
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.860]   because my starting point is a declaration
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.540]   of the nature of God, not the reality of the rubble itself.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.740]   He's good.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.780]   So if I really believe that He's good,
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:54.780]   then I have to believe that something's going to change.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.140]   I don't know how, I don't know why,
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.840]   but I will find my voice, joy in the beginning.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.320]   And I won't make my worship only a response
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.800]   to the great things He's done,
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.900]   but I will also make my worship prophetic
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.460]   because of the character and the nature of Him
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.960]   and all the change that is ahead,
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.660]   the burden in me to be different.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.620]   So let me pull it all together and finish with this.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.640]   The first part of any personal transformation journey
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.100]   is to say there's rubble, there's ruin.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.220]   It's to be honest about it, not try to hide it,
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.680]   not try to push it away.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.260]   Number two, once we do that,
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.980]   we have to recognize that God's playground is that rubble,
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.140]   that His renewal happens in the rubble.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.060]   And when we've come to understand that,
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.380]   then we come to realize that our starting point
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.100]   is not to try to change ourselves.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.740]   Our starting point is not to try to work
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:54.700]   on our circumstance.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.740]   Our starting point is worship,
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.620]   to declare God's goodness,
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.420]   even in the reality of all the things that have to come.
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.620]   And as we declare His nature over our circumstance,
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:10.620]   our perspective about that circumstance begins to change.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.740]   And even if the rubble looks so burnt out
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:18.420]   that we think nothing good could ever come from it,
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.200]   when we say He is good,
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.420]   we begin to think about the rubble differently.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.340]   The rubble begins to look way differently
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.240]   when we begin to declare the goodness of God.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.780]   If you're excited about a change
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.300]   that the Lord wants to bring your life,
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.660]   own where you are today, invite the Lord in,
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.500]   start in a place of worship,
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.640]   shift from circumstance to character in your worship,
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.700]   and look at what the Lord will do.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.460]   Amen.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.580]   Can I pray for you?
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.340]   Would you stand with me? Let's pray.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:42:02.780]   Let's just take a moment just to let the Spirit speak
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:07.340]   to each one of us personally.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.500]   He's so excited about your personal transformation journey
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.540]   over the weeks ahead.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:16.460]   Father, we thank you for what we've seen
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.620]   out of this just few verses from Ezra.
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.100]   Lord, we recognize that each one of us
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.700]   are standing to some degree in some of the ruins
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.500]   and the rubble of stuff that has happened in our past
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.720]   and the way that that has held us captive.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.660]   Father, I wanna pray right now
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.120]   just for anyone in this room
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.540]   where they're overwhelmed by the rubble.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.820]   I get it 'cause I've been many times in my life too.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.660]   And maybe if that's you,
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.840]   let me just pray pastorally over you.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:49.000]   And the pain is very real, the trauma is real.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.140]   We're not gonna sweep it under the carpet,
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.420]   pretend it's not there.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.700]   Some of you are carrying great hurt and pain.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.980]   Some of you are in really difficult circumstances
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.100]   and situations.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.540]   And we're not minimizing any of that.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.380]   In fact, what we've seen in the text today
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.720]   is that Ezra and Nehemiah did not minimize
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.620]   the burnt out rubble around them.
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:15.880]   And so if you're in a season of great trauma and trial,
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.780]   we just pray as a community over you right now.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.040]   And we pray that you would feel God's presence with you,
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.280]   you would feel strengthened,
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.080]   you'd feel the love of Christ through you,
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.600]   you would feel that you're not alone,
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.760]   that you have an army of people around you,
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.900]   and that you would feel the wind of the Spirit
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.080]   despite the reality of the pain.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:43.920]   So Lord, we just bless pastorally
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.360]   those in our community that are really struggling.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.940]   (gentle music)
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.640]   Father, I wanna challenge also some of those here
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.040]   to make a decision today.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.480]   I feel like for some of you,
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.020]   you've looked at the stuff in your past
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.700]   and you looked at the rubble that's there still,
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.820]   and you've kind of sided with the taunts of the enemy.
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.900]   And you've looked at it and you've like,
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.620]   I don't think anything good could ever come of that.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.060]   Man, I screwed up in the past, I'm on plan B,
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.920]   I'm on plan C in God's eyes.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.980]   How could God ever use me?
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:17.860]   I could understand why He's using other people,
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.440]   but He's never gonna use me.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.400]   He's never gonna heal me.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.240]   That rubble is never gonna get transformed in my life.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.860]   I feel like for some of you in this room,
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.300]   the starting point for you is to make a decision
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.140]   in your heart.
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.540]   And you may not know exactly what the Lord's gonna do,
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.340]   you may not know how it's all gonna turn out,
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.940]   but right now at the start of this series,
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.480]   it's just a simple declaration in your heart.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.100]   I don't understand it all, Lord,
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:45.700]   but I refuse to allow the rubble to tell me
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:46.800]   that there is no hope.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.620]   I refuse to allow the trauma to tell me
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.680]   that there is not a healthy version of me just ahead.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:00.380]   And I make a decision this morning in this moment
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:04.940]   to take that faith and that courage
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.780]   in this season of uncharted territory
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.400]   in the area of my personal growth.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.760]   And then for some of you,
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.720]   this worship thing is really important.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.760]   And like I said earlier,
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.200]   maybe because of all the things
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   that are happening in your life,
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.040]   the last thing you feel like doing is worshiping,
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.180]   but I wanna just release over you
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.980]   a gift of worship in your heart.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.680]   That today you would shift from worship
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.000]   that is as a result of what the Lord has done,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.840]   as good and as important as that kind of worship is,
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.040]   but worship that is a prophetic declaration
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.480]   for what the Lord may or may not do in the future.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.400]   It doesn't matter.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.560]   What matters is His character and His nature
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:49.800]   and circumstance will never shift who He is.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.200]   He is good and His love endures forever.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.520]   And Lord, I pray over anyone in this room,
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.240]   online and our overflow,
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.320]   who just needs to shift their worship
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.400]   to the nature and the character
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.280]   and the goodness of their Lord,
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.960]   despite what the rubble might be trying to say.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.120]   Lord, I pray that that shift this week
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.200]   would be monumental in their spirit
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.560]   and in their heart and in their life.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.440]   And I pray you would raise up
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.720]   like you did in Israel in those moments.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.600]   You would raise up an army of people
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:25.920]   who would rebuild walls and rebuild temples
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.840]   because they know that you are good.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.400]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.400]   Everyone says, amen, amen.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.960]   (congregation applauding)
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
