1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Amen.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 Can we put hands together for Jason?

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,440
 Thank you so much.

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
 Yay.

6
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:16,200
 So, it's January, we're doing this fast, it's the time we want to spend time, focus on God.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,920
 And I remember last year I shared something quite personal from my heart, from my own

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,840
 journey and today I intend to do the same thing.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,280
 I intend to share something more personal or bring about this message in a more personal

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,280
 way.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,480
 I hope that's okay with you.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,240
 So let's just begin with this.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,920
 At the end of every year, I would ask myself a question, a very simple question.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,160
 I would ask myself this, did I just go through the year or did I actually grow through it?

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,220
 That's the question I ask myself.

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,100
 And so things like, did I learn something new this year?

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,640
 Did I try to apply a new solution to an old problem?

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,440
 Or am I still struggling with old mistakes in my life?

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,940
 Or do I look a little bit more like Jesus this year or talk a little bit more like Him?

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,460
 So these are the questions I would ask myself.

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,100
 But if I'm honest with myself and if I'm honest with you all, I would say there are years

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:23,020
 in my life when I ask myself these questions and I'm like, no, I think I just barely went

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,020
 through it.

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,420
 I think I'm still the same person after the entire year.

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:37,740
 And when I'm this kind of honest with myself, sometimes I'm thinking, yeah, I'm not always

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:46,220
 growing as much as I wish I had because growing old is inevitable.

27
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,840
 You might have heard me talk about that before.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,020
 We always age.

29
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,020
 We keep aging.

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,180
 We can't stop that.

31
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,980
 Growing old is inevitable.

32
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,140
 But growing up is always optional.

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,900
 There's always a choice.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,060
 People that repeat the same mistakes again and again and again and again.

35
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,840
 Some of us, we never grow up.

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,660
 We just keep growing old.

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:17,880
 And so I was reflecting a little bit every year how I am growing or not growing.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,820
 And when I look back, there are some major ways where God would come and do something

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,020
 in my life that would help me grow.

40
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,540
 Often that involves, number one, a paradigm shift.

41
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,380
 Something in my head is like different.

42
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,800
 In the book of Romans, Paul says it's called the renewing of our mind.

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,660
 So by encountering God's truth, something inside here changed and so we grow a little

44
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,540
 bit more like Jesus.

45
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,700
 Just like the two disciples who are on the road to Emmaus on the first Easter.

46
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,020
 They were so sad but then they encountered Jesus.

47
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,580
 What Jesus did was he opened up the entire Old Testament scripture with them and he explained

48
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,260
 that with them in the entire journey and all of a sudden something just clicked inside

49
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,980
 and they changed.

50
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:13,060
 Their perspective on who Jesus is, his kingdom, and what their role is completely changed.

51
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,700
 So we sometimes need that kind of experience.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,580
 Hopefully this happens during the preaching or teaching time here at church.

53
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,500
 When you come in, you have an encounter with truth himself, just like the two disciples

54
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,680
 had on the road.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,580
 But there are times as well, I think during what we're going through in life in that journey,

56
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,380
 there are moments the Holy Spirit will just draw near you and whisper in your ears and

57
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,940
 by that still small voice he would come and speak to you and tell you things and because

58
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,360
 of those words that God spoke directly into your heart, you grew and you changed and something

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,740
 is different inside of you.

60
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,300
 When I look back in my life, I could think of a lot of moments like that where God came

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,560
 and taught me something valuable lessons.

62
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,660
 So that's a paradigm shift.

63
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:11,780
 The last year or more precisely before last year, before 2024, I was just, you know, towards

64
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,500
 the end of the year I was praying casually like, okay now 2024, okay God, what do you

65
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,300
 want to talk to me about?

66
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,940
 And very conveniently my birthday lies on the very end of the year.

67
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,980
 So it's kind of like, oh, let me review my life in the past year.

68
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,060
 So I always do that towards the end of the year.

69
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,740
 And I was just praying and I was hoping, okay, maybe God would ask me to do something so

70
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,740
 transformative like going on a mission trip, so adventurous to places I've never been

71
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,060
 before to places that I can't even name them up here on the stage.

72
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,500
 Wow, that would be life changing.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,780
 That would be great.

74
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,460
 Or maybe I would meet some spiritual giants and have some quality time with them and then

75
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,660
 whatever they said would inspire me.

76
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,820
 Or wish that actually happened in 2024.

77
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,460
 But then when I was praying, I actually heard these from God.

78
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,660
 He said, "Hey Chapman, in 2024, I want you to do this.

79
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,660
 I want you to go back to the basics."

80
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,380
 I'm like, huh?

81
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,380
 Going back to the basics?

82
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,380
 Like God, what do you mean?

83
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,780
 What do you mean going back to the basics?

84
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,540
 Like focus on the simple things.

85
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,780
 Things that people do or should do every day.

86
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,420
 Sometimes we overlook, we forgot to do every day.

87
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:36,860
 And so when God told me I should go back to the basics in 2024, long story short, I unexpectedly

88
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:44,420
 reconnected with a concept that I have subconsciously kind of rejected for a while.

89
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,780
 And that concept or idea, it's called spiritual discipline.

90
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,180
 And you may be like, "Whoa, what are you talking about, Chapman?

91
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,460
 You're a pastor and you subconsciously reject spiritual discipline?

92
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,460
 What are you?"

93
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,140
 Okay, okay, just hear me out, just hear me out before you freak out, all right?

94
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,340
 So I'm Chinese.

95
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:09,780
 Growing up in Hong Kong, I was from a, I grew up as a Christian and where I came from, we

96
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,980
 talk a lot about spiritual disciplines.

97
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,780
 We put a heavy emphasis on spiritual discipline.

98
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:21,060
 When I was a kid, when I went to church, my pastor, she would ask these questions like,

99
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,420
 "So have you done your devotional this week?"

100
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:32,100
 And I was like, "Yeah, how many times?"

101
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,340
 And so going to church or spiritual discipline looks a little bit like this.

102
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:44,860
 It looks like, yeah, I have to do something, put in some effort in order to earn something,

103
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,860
 some recognition.

104
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,700
 Either I feel better about myself or other people feel a little bit better about me.

105
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,180
 And sometimes, maybe some of us, we have experienced that.

106
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,740
 You come from a similar background and you have missed one or two days or three or four

107
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,340
 days on your Bible reading plan or devotional plan and then you feel so bad about yourself.

108
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,860
 I'm such a poor Christian.

109
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,420
 I'm so unworthy.

110
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,820
 I don't love God enough.

111
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,500
 And you keep beating yourself up.

112
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,820
 That's normally what happens.

113
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,380
 Or on the other hand, on some good weeks, maybe school holiday or whatever, or I've

114
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,060
 just been to a revival meeting and I come home and I'm like, "Okay, I've been reading

115
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,020
 the Bible every single day.

116
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,020
 I have seven takes in my reading plan."

117
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,900
 And you suddenly feel so pumped up like, "Oh, come on.

118
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,140
 I'm the best Christian in the entire church.

119
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,140
 Look at them.

120
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,140
 You see?

121
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
 Five takes.

122
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,140
 Oh, six takes only.

123
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
 Where did that day go?

124
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,700
 What did you do on that day?

125
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,020
 How come we didn't?"

126
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,020
 We do that kind of stuff, right?

127
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,420
 We compare ourselves with one another.

128
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,540
 And so all this spiritual discipline, it became work.

129
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,740
 It became something for us to seek approval or recognition.

130
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,580
 But then one day I heard about the truth that Jesus didn't come to build religion.

131
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,540
 Jesus came to build relationships with us.

132
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,300
 And that was like, "What?

133
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,340
 Yeah!"

134
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:11,500
 And so I realized all my understanding about my approach to what faith was wrong.

135
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,820
 So I started pursuing this love of Jesus.

136
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,540
 "Jesus, I just want to be a lover of Jesus, lover of my soul."

137
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:27,260
 Or, you know, oh yeah, we have some younger songs, "Jesus, you are my best friend."

138
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,420
 So these are the kind of songs I sang when I grew up and I, "Oh yeah, Jesus, I just want

139
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
 to be your best friend.

140
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,420
 You're my best friend.

141
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,460
 I just want to be your lover," and all that.

142
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,780
 And so yeah, whatever those, you know, spiritual discipline, they sound very legalistic.

143
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,260
 They sound very pharisaic.

144
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,220
 So yeah, I'm going to throw that out of the window.

145
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,420
 And from now on, I'm just going to pursue this relationship with Jesus.

146
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,860
 And all relationship should be organic, should be natural.

147
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,100
 We don't need those things.

148
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,820
 So when I was young, I actually had this thought that spiritual discipline and my relationship

149
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:07,340
 with God, they're actually on the opposite polar, opposite side of the spectrum.

150
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,020
 They don't, you know, they're just opposite.

151
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,660
 Until I became a dad.

152
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:22,580
 Oh yeah, then I heard my daughter say, yeah, God actually re-educated me about spiritual

153
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:29,100
 disciplines through my daughters or through the time we spent together.

154
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,140
 So soon after the pandemic, 2023, we planted this church.

155
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,380
 And then maybe in the middle of the year, me and Roslyn, we joined the church.

156
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,140
 And before it was pandemic, I was in Wan Chai.

157
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,260
 I don't always have to, I don't work on weekdays, evening, basically.

158
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,020
 So every night I'm home, but then we come to Yuen Long and then we started running Alpha

159
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,580
 and then we have worship practice on Thursday and then Wednesday or Thursday, maybe a Friday.

160
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,660
 So we started coming out a lot at night.

161
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,020
 And there was one night, our daughter, as we were leaving the house, our daughter just

162
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,180
 started yelling and crying.

163
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,460
 She said, I don't want daddy, mommy to go to church.

164
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,140
 That was a wake up call for us.

165
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:16,140
 And we started thinking about it and wow, we actually need to be conscious about a schedule

166
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,580
 during the week.

167
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,100
 So we try to make adjustments.

168
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,460
 We try to make sure we don't go out two nights in a row.

169
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,100
 We try to stay at home and have dinner with them.

170
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,060
 We consider that very important.

171
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:34,720
 And then I learned, if I consider people important in my life, then I have to make time for them.

172
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,420
 And when I want to say yes to them, it means we have to say no to other things.

173
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,540
 And when I practice at first, it's very hard for me to say no, especially, you know, it's

174
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,780
 God, ministry, church, and all that.

175
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,180
 I feel, but then I practice.

176
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,060
 I try to say no one time and then another time and then another time.

177
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,700
 As I keep saying no to other things in order to prioritize people, I feel they are the

178
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,700
 most important to me.

179
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,180
 That become a discipline.

180
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:09,020
 Well, you can argue that's kind of spiritual as well, because it's my family.

181
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,260
 So that become my spiritual discipline.

182
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,860
 And what I learned over the time as we do this, as we try to practice this, by the way,

183
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,660
 I'm not saying I'm perfect right now.

184
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,700
 There are still times I'm like, oops, I double booked myself.

185
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,460
 I book myself like multiple nights a week.

186
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,020
 We're still trying, but what I learned along the journey, it's that, you know, before I

187
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,900
 thought discipline and relationship, they're on the opposite end of the spectrum.

188
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,500
 But in this experience, what I learned was spiritual discipline or disciplines, they

189
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:47,520
 actually make room and make time for my relationship to grow.

190
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,380
 When I am present, when I make it a discipline, that's the time when I get to bond with the

191
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,980
 people I love the most.

192
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,880
 That's spiritual discipline.

193
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,980
 And some of you have heard me talking about this, that my top spiritual discipline in

194
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,340
 the last couple of years, it's actually bedtime stories.

195
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,100
 I think some of you have heard me talk about that.

196
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:18,380
 But something I will never miss as long as I'm at home.

197
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,020
 As long as I'm home, I'll try to, you know, tell a bedtime story, read a book, whatever.

198
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,220
 And you look at me, yeah, of course, Chapman, you like storytelling, right?

199
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,340
 Yeah, I like storytelling.

200
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,340
 I started storytelling on the stage at the age of five or six.

201
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
 And I love it.

202
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:40,900
 But I'm telling you this, I don't always enjoy bedtime stories, especially when I'm asked

203
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,940
 to read the same book 20 nights in a row.

204
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,140
 Three little pigs, daddy.

205
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,940
 I want three little pigs tonight.

206
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,700
 But what I learned in that journey was, if I don't know if you ask my daughters now,

207
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,780
 I don't know if they will say that to you, but at home, they say this a lot.

208
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,340
 They say, daddy is so funny.

209
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,620
 Yes, of course, I know I'm funny.

210
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,300
 I'm very well aware of that.

211
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,300
 But I don't always act funny when I'm at home.

212
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,900
 I don't normally do that during dinner.

213
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,220
 I don't normally do it like when I'm asking them, hey, go to bathe.

214
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,340
 Hey, go to bed.

215
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,820
 I'm not always funny like that.

216
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,780
 I think when I look back in my life, the funniest moment in my life when I was with them is

217
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,740
 actually bedtime stories.

218
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,460
 Maybe when I have to pretend to the big bad wolf and have to climb down the chimney and

219
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,420
 then I burn my butt because the pigs prepare you.

220
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,720
 Anyway, this is the thing.

221
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:46,660
 My daughter gets to experience who I am, my character, through what I may not always enjoy

222
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,360
 doing but I discipline myself to do.

223
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,820
 My daughter get to experience who I am through something I may not even be very passionate

224
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,380
 about doing, but I discipline myself to do.

225
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:10,340
 When there's a discipline, when relationships have space and time to grow, we get to know

226
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,580
 each other.

227
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:19,020
 And can you imagine, church, in 2025, you get to experience God's character and who

228
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,220
 he is simply through your spiritual discipline?

229
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,220
 Wouldn't that be amazing?

230
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,820
 And you know, the funny thing was I talked about, you know, I always look for growth

231
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:37,780
 in moments of paradigm shifts, like aha moments, like, oh, wow, God came and spoke to me.

232
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,780
 There's an inspiration.

233
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,780
 There's a revelation.

234
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,780
 He taught me something.

235
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,780
 Oh, I write that down.

236
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,220
 I grow so much.

237
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,860
 I always look for that kind of moments.

238
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,840
 When I was praying for my 2024, I was praying for moments of paradigm shift, but actually

239
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,780
 God told me, no, I want you to focus on spiritual discipline.

240
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,060
 And what I end up getting is a paradigm shift in my view of spiritual discipline.

241
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,140
 Okay, more people laugh than a Kennedy service.

242
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
 That's okay.

243
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,740
 I can live with that.

244
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,740
 And so this is what I want to talk about today.

245
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,180
 A paradigm shift in our perspective in spiritual disciplines at the beginning of 2025 as we

246
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,700
 continue our series on prayer.

247
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,620
 Today we're going to look at the very first letter Paul wrote in the New Testament.

248
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,780
 It's called First Thessalonians.

249
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:34,020
 Paul planted this church with his partner Silas during his second mission trip, but

250
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,780
 they faced a lot of opposition and they had no choice but to flee the city.

251
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,740
 He then sent Timothy back to encourage, to take care of the church community, and he

252
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,540
 found out from Timothy that actually their faith, despite all these struggles or opposition

253
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,140
 or difficulties or challenge, their faith actually grew even stronger.

254
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,580
 And so Paul wrote this letter to express, oh, I love you guys so much.

255
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,660
 I heard so much good things about you guys.

256
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,700
 And oh, I really long to see you guys.

257
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:09,980
 He wrote all about all this and also to encourage them to continue to grow in their relationship

258
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,740
 with God.

259
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,940
 So this is the book that we'll read a tiny bit today.

260
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,940
 We're going to read the last bit of this book.

261
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,180
 We'll read from chapter 5, verse 16.

262
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:30,540
 Paul says to this church, he says, "Hey, rejoice always, pray continually or pray without ceasing.

263
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:38,900
 Give thanks in all circumstances for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."

264
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:45,660
 I'm sure you have received like bookmarks, cards, a fridge magnet with this verse on

265
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,340
 it before.

266
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,340
 The first time I got in touch with this verse, I was a kid in church, maybe kindergarten

267
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,940
 or young primary age.

268
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,540
 We were given this flashcard with the verse on it.

269
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,660
 We have to memorize it.

270
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,540
 The next week we come back, if we could say it out loud without looking, we get a sticker.

271
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,660
 That's how I remember this verse.

272
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,940
 We will earn a sticker.

273
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:13,220
 And when I grew up, I treated this verse like a command, like something we must strive to

274
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,300
 achieve.

275
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,460
 But of course, without understanding what Paul actually mean here, it just ended up

276
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,220
 becoming a burden or some empty religious slogan.

277
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,860
 And we may just follow it half-heartedly or sometimes we may even misquote them in different

278
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,860
 scenarios.

279
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:38,180
 So today I want to look a little bit, just very short, three verses, three short sentences.

280
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:46,380
 I want to unpack this with us and see how God is going to change our paradigm on spiritual

281
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,380
 discipline.

282
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,220
 If that's okay with you, is that okay?

283
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,660
 Father, we pray that you will come and speak to us today.

284
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,940
 Your spirit will come and anoint us, open our minds to you.

285
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,060
 In Jesus' name we pray.

286
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,060
 Amen.

287
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:04,740
 When we look at these words, rejoice always, sometimes we treat them like a reminder to,

288
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,500
 "Hey, buddy, cheer up.

289
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,580
 Cheer up, come on.

290
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,380
 Put a smile on your face.

291
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
 Ha ha ha ha."

292
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,580
 Like on good days, this could make a good bumper sticker.

293
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,220
 Yeah, you know, rejoice always.

294
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,020
 Yes, put a sticker on yourself.

295
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,020
 Rejoice always.

296
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,020
 Yes, hallelujah.

297
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,380
 But you know, when there are some really bad days or when something, you're going through

298
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,060
 something really tragic or challenging or struggling, we may find it pretty harsh.

299
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,340
 It's such a harsh demand on us.

300
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,060
 If I'm struggling right now, if I'm going through pain right now, let's say if my career

301
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:47,260
 is at risk, like my company is laying off people or if I'm fighting a major health problem,

302
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,420
 none of this is good news.

303
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,100
 How do you expect me to be joyful?

304
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,740
 Should I force myself to laugh?

305
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,900
 Should I just tickle myself until I laugh?

306
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,740
 So what Paul writes here, just to be clear, it's not a command to be happy.

307
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,860
 It's not a command to even feel happy.

308
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:12,220
 When he says rejoice, all the time he means rejoice in the Lord.

309
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,340
 This is the same kind of language he employed in another letter he wrote to the Philippi

310
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,420
 Christians and he wrote this in Philippians 4.

311
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,500
 He says, you know, rejoice in the Lord always.

312
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,940
 You see, rejoice always, but you got three more words, in the Lord.

313
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,820
 There's a context.

314
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,060
 When Paul says rejoice always, he says rejoice in the Lord always.

315
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,840
 And that's very interesting because if you're an Old Testament reader, you would find this

316
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,920
 phrase very familiar.

317
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,220
 This actually, this phrase actually echoes the language that is used in a particular

318
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,960
 Old Testament book, the Psalm, the hymn book of the Hebrews.

319
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,260
 And this is a call to worship that we can find in Psalms such as in Psalm 95 it says,

320
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,420
 "Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord.

321
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,340
 Let us shout aloud to the rock of our salvation."

322
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,180
 Or in Psalm 100 it says this, "Shout for joy to the Lord.

323
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,380
 All the earth worship the Lord with gladness.

324
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,220
 Come before him with joyful songs."

325
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,540
 Let me say this again.

326
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,580
 The phrase rejoice always, it is not a command to cheer up.

327
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,580
 Instead, it is an invitation to worship.

328
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,020
 In the Old Testament in the Psalms when it talks about, hey, rejoicing the Lord is always

329
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,980
 a call to worship.

330
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:42,620
 And worship, it's always joyful because if you know who you are worshiping, he's not

331
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,100
 just the creator, he's not just the king of kings, not just the master, but he's also

332
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,860
 our savior.

333
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,780
 He's the rock of our salvation.

334
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,020
 He will save us.

335
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,060
 He will help us.

336
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,100
 He will not abandon us.

337
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,300
 Last month I was preaching on Mary's song called the Magnificat.

338
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:11,820
 She sang that, "My spirit rejoices in God, my savior."

339
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,380
 There's a reason for our joy.

340
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,100
 I spoke about that last month because we have a God who's not just a master watching over

341
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,220
 us making sure we don't make mistakes or he's not just the one who created us and just dump

342
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
 us here.

343
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,420
 He is our savior.

344
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,540
 When we're in trouble, he's always the one that will show up.

345
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,940
 He's always the one who would come to our rescue.

346
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,500
 He's always the one ever present in our life.

347
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,060
 And so Jesus, yes, he has saved us on the cross.

348
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:45,660
 And while we will experience that fullness of salvation the day when Jesus comes back,

349
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:52,020
 we are already experiencing that transformation, that love, that joy.

350
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,860
 Jesus had already made it possible for us when he died on the cross.

351
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:05,020
 So when Paul calls us to worship and to rejoice, we could only do that if our hearts truly

352
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,220
 recognize God as a savior.

353
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,060
 Oh, because this is a God of worship.

354
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,260
 When I'm in trouble, he will come to my rescue.

355
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,500
 He will come and save me.

356
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,900
 I know what he has done.

357
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,660
 I know what he has made available for me.

358
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,260
 That's why my heart can rejoice.

359
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,220
 There's joy like bubbling up inside of me.

360
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,140
 And so if we look at what David wrote in Psalm 16, he says this.

361
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,420
 David said, "You made known to me the path of life.

362
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:40,020
 You will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand."

363
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,020
 David is known to be a worshiper throughout his entire life.

364
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,820
 And he connects the very idea of joy with his experience when he's spending time in

365
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,300
 the loving presence of God.

366
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,860
 There's joy in his presence.

367
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,260
 When David was worshiping God, when he was fixing his eyes on him, recognizing him as

368
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,180
 his protection, as his provider, he said, "You know what?

369
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,300
 Joy will find you.

370
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,200
 You should be filled with joy."

371
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,380
 So you don't have to force yourself to be happy, church.

372
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,740
 Let me say this again.

373
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,740
 Rejoice always is not a command to cheer up.

374
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,500
 It is actually an invitation to worship.

375
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,620
 Come and worship him.

376
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,300
 Recognize he's your savior.

377
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
 He's your king.

378
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,820
 He's your creator.

379
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,140
 And open your eyes to see his greatness, his power, his mercy, his love.

380
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,540
 Spend time in that presence and look.

381
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,820
 When you see his greatness, when you see his glory, and you look at your problem again,

382
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,820
 "Oh, yeah, okay.

383
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,820
 His problems are not a big deal.

384
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,940
 It's just a piece of cake for him."

385
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:55,060
 And joy will start overflowing your heart.

386
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:00,660
 So then Paul, after saying rejoice always, which is an invitation to worship, sorry,

387
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,340
 I got to drink water.

388
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,700
 Holidays are bad for health.

389
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,660
 I'm still recovering from holiday.

390
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,220
 Sorry.

391
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,780
 Okay.

392
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,940
 So after that, he says, "Pray continually or pray without ceasing."

393
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,820
 Well, does that mean I have to whisper my prayer every waking moment?

394
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,140
 Well, I would say no harm to try.

395
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,300
 You can certainly do that.

396
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,100
 I think it's good for you.

397
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:34,420
 But if we talk about praying, and praying means talking to God, communicating with God,

398
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:41,540
 and I look into my life, and I would say my closest experience of talking or communicating

399
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:48,580
 to someone continually or unceasingly, that would be when I first met Ross, when we first

400
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
 started dating.

401
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,580
 She would be the last...

402
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,580
 Okay.

403
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,580
 Don't worry.

404
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,900
 She would be the last person I talked to before I closed my eyes on the bed, and she would

405
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,980
 always be the first person that I messaged once I opened my eyes.

406
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,300
 That's called without ceasing.

407
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
 I don't know why.

408
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,820
 I'm at work, but I'll just send her a picture.

409
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,140
 I'm going to have lunch at McDonald's.

410
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,300
 Oh, I'm having lunch at McDonald's.

411
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,700
 Send her a selfie.

412
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,580
 And so although I was in Hong Kong, she was in Singapore, embarrassing her right now.

413
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,900
 We're literally thousands of miles away, but at any moment in the day, I know exactly where

414
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,820
 she is, her location.

415
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,220
 I know the exact location where she is.

416
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,220
 Because we are...

417
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
 I think she...

418
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
 Is she shaking her head?

419
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
 No, I hope not.

420
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:39,820
 Because we are communicating, we are talking without ceasing with one another.

421
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,060
 I have another group of friends.

422
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,940
 They're my friends from seminary.

423
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,380
 We all stay in the same room.

424
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,540
 They're my roommates.

425
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,780
 I met them 15-ish years ago.

426
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,260
 2009, or something like that.

427
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,420
 More than 15 years ago.

428
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,540
 And until today...

429
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,900
 Well, until today, I meet them like once or twice a year.

430
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,460
 We'll have an annual gathering, doing hot pot together.

431
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,700
 So I see them about once or twice a year.

432
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,780
 But I talk to them every day.

433
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,020
 We have a WhatsApp chat group, or Signal, whatever you use.

434
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,060
 But some chat groups on this kind of media.

435
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,780
 And we talk every day.

436
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,300
 We talk about almost everything.

437
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
 We talk about work.

438
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,540
 Yeah, they're my seminary classmates.

439
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,100
 When we talk about work, yeah.

440
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,100
 Just...

441
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
 No, no.

442
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
 When we talk about work...

443
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
 Okay, don't worry.

444
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,460
 No, just generally, like what we're doing, and blah, blah, blah.

445
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,220
 So they know exactly what I've been through in my life.

446
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,780
 I know exactly what they are going through in their life.

447
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,780
 But not just that.

448
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,780
 We talk about everything.

449
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,620
 Oh, Japanese yen is cheap right now.

450
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,420
 Should we go and change some?

451
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,700
 Oh, yeah.

452
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
 Manchester United.

453
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,700
 Come on.

454
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,100
 It's horrible.

455
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,420
 Such a bad game last night.

456
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,700
 Oh, yeah.

457
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,060
 You know what?

458
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,060
 This theologian Bonhoeffer, he just, you know, there's a book about him talking about...

459
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,980
 We talk about anything.

460
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,380
 We talk about anything.

461
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,180
 And we talk every single day.

462
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,540
 Like every single day, I receive the messages.

463
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,700
 We talk every day, although I only see them two or one time every year.

464
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,860
 But we talk about everything.

465
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:27,660
 My point is, there's something I learned about communication in these experiences.

466
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,260
 There is communication, right?

467
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,420
 I just talked about that.

468
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:41,180
 What matters in communication, I found out, is not just what you say or how you say it.

469
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,660
 It really matters who you're saying it to or who you're talking to as well.

470
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,540
 You probably won't talk to your colleagues or your boss nonstop, unceasing throughout

471
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,540
 the day.

472
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,180
 Even at night, they probably won't be the last person you message before you go to bed.

473
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
 Or the first person you message.

474
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,020
 Maybe the first person you message, that's your boss.

475
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,060
 Yeah, I can get it.

476
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,460
 But they're not the ones you want to talk to unceasingly, right?

477
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,460
 Your colleagues, your boss at office.

478
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,900
 Sorry, we're in Hong Kong.

479
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,140
 I may get this totally wrong.

480
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,220
 But you get what I want to say, right?

481
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,260
 You get what I mean, right?

482
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,980
 But if that's your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, yeah, that's a totally different

483
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,380
 story.

484
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,220
 It's not just what we say or how we say it matters.

485
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,300
 Who we're saying it to, who we're talking to, it matters.

486
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,940
 And so we always say that communication is crucial to relationship.

487
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,020
 But what I want to say is the opposite is also true.

488
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,340
 Your relationship determines your communication.

489
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:44,300
 Or more precisely, it is your intimacy, your passion in that relationship that drives the

490
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,940
 way you communicate.

491
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:52,400
 Your desire and willingness to share and the frequency of your communication.

492
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,860
 So how can we pray without ceasing if praying is communication?

493
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,100
 I can tell you, I can only think of one way.

494
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,300
 It's really simple.

495
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,980
 It's when you talk to God, you pray to God as though you're talking to someone you've

496
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,180
 just fallen in love with.

497
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,540
 Or maybe your best buddies, your BFF, someone like that.

498
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,860
 Those people are the ones when something happened in your life, immediately the first person

499
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,540
 you want to share, you want to pick up your phone and you want to text them, "Oh, this

500
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,580
 just happened in my life."

501
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,180
 If you want to pray and cease into God, that's the only way.

502
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,420
 I don't know if there's any other way.

503
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,780
 If you have another way, you can tell me.

504
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:34,780
 But without that kind of relationship, without that kind of love, that kind of intimacy,

505
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,900
 it always feels like work.

506
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,060
 Yeah, because my boss demand me to send him a message, I wake up.

507
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,380
 So I have to do it.

508
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,940
 No, my boss doesn't do that, by the way, okay?

509
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
 Don't get it wrong.

510
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,940
 My boss is very kind.

511
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:59,740
 But unless we have that kind of relationship with him, this will never make sense to us.

512
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:11,220
 So when Paul says, "Pray without ceasing," he's actually inviting us into an intimacy

513
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,340
 with God himself.

514
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:18,740
 Unless God is your lover, unless he's your best friend, you will never talk to him like

515
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,580
 that, like unceasing, like continually.

516
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:28,380
 That will never happen until he's your lover, until he's your friend, until you enjoy his

517
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,780
 presence, until you enjoy every moment you spend with him.

518
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,940
 So that's what he's instructing us to do.

519
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:43,780
 He's inviting us into that kind of relationship with Jesus.

520
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,060
 And finally, "Give thanks in all circumstances."

521
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,140
 This is a tricky one, very tricky.

522
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:58,940
 What it doesn't mean, surely, is that we give thanks for everything.

523
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,620
 I don't think we need to give thanks if one day we find out we have cancer.

524
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,940
 We don't have to give thanks for that.

525
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,820
 If something bad happens to us, we don't have to give thanks for that.

526
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:15,500
 Paul is actually saying we give thanks in all circumstances.

527
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,860
 But what I suggest we shouldn't do as well is we shouldn't cultivate the practice of

528
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,940
 fake or half-hearted thanksgiving.

529
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,220
 "Oh, there's a traffic jam today and I arrived at work late.

530
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,060
 Oh, but thank you, God.

531
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,900
 At least I'm in one piece.

532
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
 I'm safe.

533
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
 I arrived at office safely."

534
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,180
 Please don't try to do that.

535
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,540
 If you don't mean it, don't say it.

536
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,380
 That doesn't please God.

537
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,620
 And this is an important thing that I learned throughout the years.

538
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,700
 At the heart of thanksgiving, it's actually a truly thankful heart.

539
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,380
 Let me say that again.

540
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:00,260
 At the heart of thanksgiving, it's a truly thankful heart.

541
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,780
 It must be heartfelt.

542
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,860
 It must be sincere.

543
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:09,460
 When it comes to thanksgiving or gratitude, now I want to differentiate a little bit.

544
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:15,900
 I want to differentiate gratitude between the action and behavior itself and the attitude

545
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,100
 or lifestyle.

546
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,860
 We use these words in both senses.

547
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:25,740
 It could be just the action itself or the behavior, saying thank you to someone.

548
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,500
 But when you talk about gratitude, it can sometimes mean an attitude, meaning a way

549
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,020
 of life, meaning a lifestyle.

550
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:40,580
 And so as parents, I've been or we've been teaching our girls to say thank you.

551
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,580
 It's not the hardest thing.

552
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,380
 The hardest thing is always sorry.

553
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,860
 Thank you is less hard to do it.

554
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,460
 Okay, all you parents laugh.

555
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,860
 I know you know.

556
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:56,340
 But in our effort to teach our girls to say thank you, our goal is never to see them giving

557
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,540
 a robotic expression when they receive a gift or a favor in the future.

558
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,340
 What we're really hoping is that through the practicing of this behavior of saying thank

559
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:15,220
 you, they would establish a consistent mindset, recognizing and appreciating the positive

560
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
 aspects of life.

561
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,180
 Let me say that again.

562
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,500
 I'm not trying to get them to give a very robotic response every time someone do them

563
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
 a favor.

564
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,500
 I want them to have this mindset built in inside of them so they would get to appreciate,

565
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:34,460
 they get to notice the good around them, the good that is done in their life.

566
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,900
 And it's not just a temporary mood.

567
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,380
 It's more like a grateful heart.

568
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,940
 I want them to carry that grateful heart.

569
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,100
 You know, I don't need them to say thank you to me every time I change their diapers or

570
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,380
 pass them a tissue or do something.

571
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,540
 I don't need them to say thank you because I need that.

572
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,140
 I need to feel that.

573
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,780
 I need to feel, oh, somebody is grateful to what I've done.

574
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,260
 Oh, that's, I'm receiving recognition.

575
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,820
 I don't need that, guys.

576
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,180
 I'm grown up.

577
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,780
 I'm better than that.

578
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:16,500
 But nowadays, when we talk about thanksgiving in the Bible, we always thought, yeah, because

579
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:22,740
 God is due all these like thanksgiving and praise and, you know, we always look at it

580
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,740
 at that way.

581
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:29,580
 Of course, again, God is always due all those praise and thanksgiving, but we always, sometimes

582
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:35,060
 we communicate in a way that because God needs it, that's why I give it to him.

583
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,820
 We communicate that way.

584
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,580
 But I'm telling you, when I change my daughter's diaper, I don't need her to say thank you

585
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,340
 because I need someone to say thank you to me.

586
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,100
 And modern psychologists actually have some very interesting findings.

587
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:53,340
 Gratitude, it's a big topic in modern psychological research.

588
00:34:53,340 --> 00:35:00,220
 And most psychologists, they would agree that the attitude of gratitude shapes how individual

589
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,100
 interpret events, fostering resilience and optimism.

590
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:09,180
 Those with a grateful mindset, they tend to focus on what they have rather than what they

591
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:15,260
 lack, which can lead to greater life satisfaction and emotional stability.

592
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,020
 And what I'm about to read to you is what I found on the National Library of Medicine

593
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,660
 of the United States.

594
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:26,220
 The effects of gratitude interventions, a systematic review and meta-analysis.

595
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,340
 I'm just going to read a little bit.

596
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,820
 It says gratitude is difficult to define.

597
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:37,700
 It's been conceptualized as emotion, attitude, blah, blah, blah.

598
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,380
 And let me read this paragraph next.

599
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,500
 Gratitude is a light expression not necessarily conditioned to good times, making it possible

600
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:52,460
 to maintain the feeling and feel good even during negative experiences or most difficult

601
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,420
 moments.

602
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,660
 Logical relationship has been established between gratitude and well-being, blah, blah,

603
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,660
 blah, blah, blah.

604
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,780
 I just want to read the last bit.

605
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:05,900
 The results demonstrate that acts of gratitude can be used as a therapeutic complement for

606
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:11,020
 treating anxiety and depression and can increase positive feelings and emotions in the general

607
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,140
 population.

608
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:22,300
 You know, there are people out there just by saying thank you to the universe every

609
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,540
 day, their depression gets better.

610
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,460
 Their anxiety gets better.

611
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:33,020
 They're not even thanking God himself, the creator, the provider, the one who really

612
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,020
 looks after.

613
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,540
 They're just thanking some random energy in the universe and they're like, "Oh, I'm so

614
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,540
 thankful."

615
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,620
 And then they actually get better.

616
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,660
 So I'm suggesting this.

617
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:49,380
 When God or in the Bible instructs us to say thank you to God or offer a thanksgiving to

618
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,580
 God, we always think, yeah, that's a duty because, you know, that's the praise and thanksgiving

619
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,580
 that God is due.

620
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:02,700
 But I'm humbly suggesting that when we engage in the act of thanksgiving, the first person

621
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,700
 who benefit from it, it's actually ourselves.

622
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,660
 God didn't just ask you to be thankful so that he can receive your praise and thanksgiving.

623
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,700
 It's for your own good, church.

624
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,800
 Do you see that?

625
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:25,740
 So when Paul says, you know, give thanks in all circumstances, he's not trying to ask

626
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,980
 you to, oh, you know, find something to be thankful about and, you know, just offer,

627
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,540
 you know, say a prayer.

628
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,700
 No, no, no, no, no.

629
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,900
 He's asking, he's not just talking about the behavior or action of thanksgiving.

630
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,740
 He's talking about the attitude, the lifestyle of gratitude.

631
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,460
 Just now I said gratitude.

632
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,580
 It's not just conditioned to good times, even during negative experiences and most difficult

633
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,380
 moments.

634
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:03,020
 And this is the context of the church in Thessalonians.

635
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,100
 I talked about this just now, like this church, they're going through persecution, they're

636
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,620
 going through a hard time, and Paul come alongside them.

637
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,940
 Paul actually wrote this.

638
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,740
 He said, I know what you're facing.

639
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,900
 I know it was difficult.

640
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,840
 In 1 Thessalonians 3, he says this, you know, I sent Timothy to strengthen and encourage

641
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,740
 you in your faith so that no one would be unsettled by these trials.

642
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,260
 I know you're going through trials in life, just like every single one of us here.

643
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:38,700
 I know you guys are going through difficult moments, for you know quite well, Paul says,

644
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,580
 we're destined for them.

645
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,220
 We're destined for trials.

646
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,900
 We're destined for challenges.

647
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,340
 We're destined for difficulties in our lives.

648
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,860
 And so Paul came and gave them an instruction.

649
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,140
 Paul came and gave them a paradigm shift in spiritual discipline.

650
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,580
 Oh, you thought being joyful, it's about making yourself feel good.

651
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,580
 No, no, no, no, no.

652
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:09,540
 I'm actually inviting you back into worship where you experience the goodness of God.

653
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,420
 You're in his presence like David, and then joy starts to fill you.

654
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,500
 Oh, you think prayer means it's a work.

655
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
 No, no, no.

656
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
 I'm not asking you to talk to your boss.

657
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:23,020
 I'm asking you to build this loving relationship with God so that you will be always filled

658
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,220
 with that love that he has for you.

659
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:29,540
 You are always in this intimate relationship, this kind of communication with him.

660
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,980
 Oh, you think I asked you to give thanks because you know God needs someone to say thanks?

661
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,860
 No, it's for your own benefit, church.

662
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:42,780
 That is what Paul is trying to communicate with us here.

663
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,700
 If you can go through those darkest moments in your life and you can rejoice always by

664
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,260
 worshiping him, if he's your lover in those moments when you're going through hardship,

665
00:39:53,260 --> 00:40:00,580
 you can continue to talk to him, anything, just talk to him about it.

666
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:14,060
 If you could remain a thankful, a grateful person in midst of that difficulty, I don't

667
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,260
 know what kind of a person you would be like, but I know a lot of people would be so jealous

668
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,660
 of you.

669
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:31,940
 And just now when Pastor Tim was reading that message, I saw a glimpse of that.

670
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,940
 I'm grateful that we're a church, we're a family, that when somebody's needs arise,

671
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:42,860
 we can pray together unceasingly, but I'm also glad that we're a community that we can

672
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,700
 rejoice together.

673
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,500
 We continue to pray and we give thanks together.

674
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,020
 You know, when Paul first wrote that, it's in a second person plural form, in grammar

675
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,780
 means like you all, so it means we rejoice always together.

676
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,260
 We pray unceasingly together.

677
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,860
 We give thanks in all circumstances together.

678
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:16,380
 I'm glad I'm a part of a community like this with you all and we can do that together.

679
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,780
 And so whenever I ask myself at the end of a year whether I have, you know, did I just

680
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,020
 go through a year, did I grow through a year?

681
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:33,340
 Can I say, if I'm honest, there are years, some very difficult moments happen, some very

682
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:37,020
 difficult events happen.

683
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,780
 Actually even right before I came to Yuen Long, there were some moments like that, but

684
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:48,060
 it was those years, it was those moments when I look back at the end of the year, it's almost

685
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:52,020
 like I don't have to think, I don't have to ask myself this question, I'm like, yes, I

686
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,620
 have grown through like this year when there was a very difficult moment, when there was

687
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:01,180
 a challenge, when there was hardship, because number one, I'm destined for trials, but number

688
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:07,740
 two, when I invest myself back in those spiritual disciplines, or even when I'm not able to

689
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:14,180
 do that, God is pursuing me, he always meet me in the valley, he always meet me in the

690
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,180
 darkest moments.

691
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:22,580
 And in my personal, short personal experience on earth, I will confidently say this, there's

692
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:30,100
 no encounter with God, wait, let me rephrase this, the encounter with God in the valley,

693
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:35,140
 in the darkest valley, there's nothing you can compare that kind of encounter in your

694
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,020
 life.

695
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:44,220
 Not moments of encounters on mountaintop, not when you're in somewhere safe, somewhere

696
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:51,460
 joyful, when you encounter God in the valley of darkness, that kind of encounter, nothing

697
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,140
 can compare to that.

698
00:42:53,140 --> 00:43:00,540
 And Paul is inviting his beloved church into this kind of experience by immersing themselves,

699
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:05,700
 investing themselves into spiritual discipline.

700
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:15,200
 So perhaps some of you, like me, here, we all need a paradigm shift in a view on spiritual

701
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,180
 discipline today.

702
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:23,620
 It's not work, it's not what you need to do, got a list you need to check off, it's an

703
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,060
 invitation.

704
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:33,100
 Invitation to joy, invitation to intimacy and love with God, intimacy to well-being,

705
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,100
 emotional well-being.

706
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:40,060
 And I'm gonna invite the worship team back on stage and we're just gonna pray a little

707
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,060
 bit.

708
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:55,300
 Can I invite us to close our eyes all across the room?

709
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,300
 I had these verses written in my notes.

710
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:05,660
 I think it could be for some people in this room, so I'm just gonna read it out.

711
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:12,180
 In Isaiah 30 verse 20, it says this, "Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity

712
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,580
 and water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more.

713
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,580
 With your own eyes, you will see them.

714
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:27,220
 Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you saying,

715
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:32,940
 'This is the way, walk in it.'"

716
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:39,660
 I believe God wants to give us a paradigm shift today so that at the end of the year,

717
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,540
 when you ask yourself the same question I ask myself every year, did I just go through

718
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,420
 this year or have I grown through this year?

719
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:52,940
 I think God wants to do something in your life today so that in December 2025, when

720
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,740
 you ask yourself these questions, you can confidently say, "I have grown through this

721
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,740
 year."

722
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:02,020
 Yes, I know, growing old is inevitable, but growing up is optional.

723
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:08,300
 But God is gonna do something in us today that even if it's optional, even if there's

724
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:16,020
 a price to pay, something in our lives are gonna change today.

725
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:20,500
 That's what he put on my heart before I came to you today.

726
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:26,780
 And I said, "Why don't we just invite the Holy Spirit now in your own way, in your own

727
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:40,020
 language?"

728
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,260
 And a series is called "Boat in Prayer."

729
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:50,740
 There's one prayer, I've been trying to phrase it properly, but I think some of us, I've

730
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,980
 prayed this prayer when I was about 19 or 20.

731
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:04,020
 It's powerful, it's dangerous, but if you're bold enough, you may consider praying it.

732
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:09,100
 When I was about 19 or 20, I once prayed, "God, I want to meet you.

733
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:14,780
 If I'm in a valley, if I'm in a valley of darkness, I don't want to pray that I could

734
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,860
 get out of this valley.

735
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:22,460
 I want to pray that I'll meet you right where I am."

736
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:28,340
 That's perhaps one of the most important paradigms you've got has given me in my life.

737
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:33,820
 If I'm in a valley, maybe right now, maybe I don't know, wherever you are, but maybe

738
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:39,860
 in the future, but whenever you're in a valley, don't ask God to just grab you out, ask him

739
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,300
 to meet you right where you are.

740
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:48,100
 You know, when David wrote this verses in Psalm 23, he says, "Though I walk through

741
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:55,820
 the valley of shadow of death, I fear no evil, for his staff and his rod comforts me."

742
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:02,180
 You can only experience this kind of comfort while you're in the valley.

743
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:08,420
 When you're at a table, sat before your enemy, or when you're at the green pastures, you

744
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,420
 don't experience this kind of comfort.

745
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:16,620
 I mean, there are blessings in those scenarios as well, but that kind of comfort only comes

746
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:23,980
 when God draws near you as you are standing right in, right in the middle of the valley.

747
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:29,020
 So if there's someone in this room today, you know you're going through a valley moment,

748
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,460
 the valley of shadow of death, you're going through a difficult moment, you know you're

749
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:39,060
 destined for trial, you're feeling it, I invite you to say, "God, I'm going to meet you right

750
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,060
 where I am.

751
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,900
 I'm not going to run away.

752
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,380
 I'm not just going to pray you take."

753
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:50,180
 Of course you can pray that God takes you away, but more than that, I hope you can pray,

754
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,300
 "God, I want to meet you right where I am."

755
00:47:52,300 --> 00:48:10,820
 So that you can experience real joy, not the fake one.

756
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:18,860
 So that it's this moment that you're sometimes closest with Him, that our friendship with

757
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,940
 Him grows.

758
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:31,780
 It's in this moment, true resilience is demonstrated in our lives.

759
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:40,620
 And it's this moment that God just comes so near you.

760
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:46,700
 And that will strengthen your faith for the rest of your life.

761
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:51,100
 Don't run from it.

762
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,820
 Don't just go through it.

763
00:48:53,820 --> 00:49:02,220
 Church, let us grow through it this year.

764
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:13,020
 So come Holy Spirit, speak to us, or just bring us back to the basics, to take the baby

765
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,620
 steps.

766
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:31,420
 I pray that throughout this season of fasting, mentality will shift from work to joy, to

767
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,420
 relationship.

768
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:39,460
 But we also know that it's our discipline, our spiritual disciplines that make room and

769
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,780
 time for these relationships to grow.

770
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:48,020
 Our relationship with you to grow.

771
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:56,540
 I pray you would come in, touch us today, in Jesus' name.

772
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:06,540
