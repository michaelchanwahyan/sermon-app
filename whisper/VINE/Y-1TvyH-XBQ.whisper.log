[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   When I was 17 years old, a few years ago, my life changed.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   I remember I was at work and a friend came in with some devastating news.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   My boyfriend had been killed in a road accident.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Tragically, the car that he was in hit a lorry, head on collision, he was killed instantly.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   I was 17 and that news knocked me down in so many ways.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I had a vague understanding that God was good.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I had been raised in a loving home.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   My parents were practicing Mormons, so I had a concept of God.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   But the death tragically hardened my heart.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And so therefore all forms of faith and religion, to me, became irrelevant.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   After all, how could a loving God let that happen?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   A young life, a good life, needlessly taken.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And my philosophy in life was therefore shaped.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Life was short. Life was to be lived.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Death was the end. That was it.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And our time on earth really was meaningless.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And to fill the emptiness in my life, I looked for satisfaction in many different places.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Fast forward a couple of years and I found myself in Spain, Barcelona.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Anybody from Barcelona?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   It's a beautiful place.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   When we travel again, yeah, online.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Hola, como estas?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   When we get to travel again, hopefully you can visit Barcelona, beautiful city.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It was there that my life was changed once again.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   But this time, instead of death, I found life.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Instead of emptiness, I found love.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I encountered God.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   It wasn't anything super dramatic.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   It was actually just in a dream.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   But in my dream, I was standing in a church and Jesus appeared to me.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And I just knew it was Jesus, although I didn't know much about who he was.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And he told me, "Karla, I want you to shine for me."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And that was it. Then I woke up.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I can't really explain that that change had in me.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   In many ways, it was gradual.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   But in other ways, it was instant.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And I found myself suddenly in a place of longing to know God more.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Through being in his presence, through reading his Bible,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I would spend hours alone just chatting with God.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I would devour scripture.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I was fascinated by the gospels.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I was fascinated by the life of Jesus, the man that he was and the things that he did.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   The Holy Spirit was a companion to me.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And my time in Spain was truly special because it birthed in me a hunger
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   to always pursue God, to be in his presence.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And in pursuing him, I got to know him more, to understand his love.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And even though I was living in a foreign land with no friends and no real future,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I found myself completely satisfied.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So today, my question to us is, how do we pursue God to know him?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And how can we enter into his presence, experience him in new and profound ways?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And as we start this new series in the Psalms, I turn to Psalm 63,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   one of my favorite Psalms, to share with us some insights about what it looks like
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   to desire God's presence and the ways that we can pursue God to get to know him more deeply.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And the bold declaration that the psalmist's relationship with God speaks of
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   reminds me of my days in Spain when God's presence was all I needed.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And it's my prayer today that as we look at this Psalm, you would be stirred,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I would be stirred, we would be stirred to really hunger for God's presence.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And in doing so, we come to know him just that little bit more.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So before we read Psalm 63, I want to give some context.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   We know the title tells us that it is a Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Now, commentators generally agree the Psalm was likely to be written by David,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   belongs either to David's wilderness years before he came to the throne of Israel,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   when he was on the run from King Saul, or to his brief exile from the throne
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   during the rebellion of his son, Absalom.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   But regardless of whether it was before or after he was king of Israel,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   we know it was a time when David is on the run, away from the safety and security of his city,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   hiding in the arid desert lands, his future uncertain.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And knowing this context makes the Psalm even more amazing,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   because David with his life in danger, physically and mentally exhausted,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   doesn't focus on physical wants and desires, but rather focuses on his spiritual needs,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   a longing for God's presence, a satisfaction in who God is,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   and an assurance that his God will deliver him.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So as we read together, let's keep that in mind.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Now you can watch it on screen, read it on screen, you can get out your phones,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   or your iPhones, or whatever, or you can close your eyes as I read.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   "You God are my God. Earnestly I seek you. I thirst for you.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   My whole being longs for you in a dry and parched land where there is no water.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   because your love is better than life.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   My lips will glorify you. I will praise you as long as I live.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And in your name I will lift up my hands.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I will be fully satisfied as with the riches of foods.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   With singing lips my mouth will praise you.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   On my bed I remember you. I think of you through the watches of the night,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   because you are my help. I sing in the shadow of your wings.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I cling to you. Your right hand upholds me.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Those who want to kill me will be destroyed.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   They will go down to the depths of the earth.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   But the king will rejoice in God.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   All who swear by God will glory in him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced."
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   From this psalm and other psalms of David, we know that no matter what season David is in,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   the ups and the downs, he always comes back to pursue God and his presence.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I like David has ups and downs.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   It makes me feel better about those times where I'm saying,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   "God, what are you doing?" or "God, where are you?"
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It helps also knowing that in pursuing the presence of God,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   it's so important for us as Christians,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   because we cannot truly know God unless we know his presence.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Unless we know God, we will struggle with that genuine satisfaction.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   As Paul writes, "I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I know what it is to be in need, what it is to have plenty.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   whether well-fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or what.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I can do all this through him who gives me strength."
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   The secret that Paul talks about is found in the relationship that we have with God,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   in knowing who he is and the love that he has for us.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   So how do we pursue God to know him?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Psalm 63 helps us.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   First, we see confession as an important key.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   At the very beginning of the Psalm, David declares to God that he,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Elohim, was David's God in the most fundamental sense.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   "Oh God, you are my God."
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   That was a significant statement by David.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Polytheism, the worship of multiple deities, was very common during David's life.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   All the nations had their own gods, and even amongst the Israelites,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   God's chosen people, that temptation to worship other gods was strong.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And time and time we see it.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   They failed to stay true and faithful to their God,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   even when they experienced incredible miracles and God's deliverance time and time again.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   But David, for all of his failures, did not worship any other gods.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And he led Israel as a king devoted to worshiping the one true God.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And we hear in Psalm 63, right at the start, his allegiance to Yahweh.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   This is significant for us today.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Deuteronomy tells us, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone."
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   "Hear, O Hong Kong, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone."
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   In Timothy, "For there is one God, one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   No one comes to the Father except through me."
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Therefore, if we confess to know God, we're choosing to believe in Jesus,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   we are aligning ourselves to his teaching.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   There is only one God.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   There is one way to him through Jesus.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Now, I know that is not culturally popular, right?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   As a pastor, when people find out what I do, often they will say to me,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   "Oh, yes, Christian, yes, Jesus, I believe in Jesus too.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I also pray to Buddha."
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Or, "Well, you know what?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I think all religions, all faiths, they're all good.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   They all lead to that one place.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   We're all going to heaven."
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   To truly know God means to choose allegiance to Jesus,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   recognizing he is the way, he is the truth, he is the life.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   To enter into God's presence, we must have that personal relationship with Jesus.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And if you're here today and you don't know Jesus,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   or maybe you believe in God and you consider all religions as a way to God,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   to really know God and his presence, we must confess Jesus is our Savior.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   For those of us that know Jesus, we call ourselves Christians,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   but how do we live out the confession of our faith?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Are we publicly open about our beliefs?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   David glorified God with his lips.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   My lips will glorify you.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   I will praise you.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And with his hands, I will lift up my hands.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   And for David, the lifting of the hands was not only the common posture of prayer
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   amongst ancient Hebrews, it also displayed that anticipation of gratefully receiving God
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   and that sense of surrender to him.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Do we lift up our hands in surrender?
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   What do we do with our hands?
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Do our actions glorify God?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   What is our public witness to those around us and the things that we say
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   and the things that we do?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   We can sing songs and raise our hands in worship on a Sunday,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   but how do our hands and lips confess our faith Monday through to Saturday?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   So how do we pursue God to know him?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   We do this by confessing Jesus as Lord and living surrendered, obedient lives.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   And then next we see meditation as an important key to pursuing God to know him.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   David says, "I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and glory."
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   David was not at the sanctuary when he created this psalm.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   He was in the wilderness of Judah, far from the tabernacle tent
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   that housed God's presence in Jerusalem, far from the safety and the security of his city.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Yet he knew that God's sanctuary was not only a place,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   but a spiritual concept that could be entered by faith no matter where a person is.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   He had witnessed God's power and glory, not just confined to a physical place,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   God's presence is not just confined to this building,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   but he knew God's presence was everywhere around him.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   He knew God's power. He knew his love.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And so he declared, "Love, your love is better than life."
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   That Hebrew word for love that David refers to is chesed.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   It's the idea of faithful love in action.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   It's expressed in both God's loyalty to his covenant and his love to his people.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Theologian John Oswald describes chesed as a completely undeserved kindness and generosity.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   The scholar Daryl Bock writes, "Chesed is wrapping up in itself all the positive attributes of God,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   love, covenant faithfulness, mercy, grace, kindness, loyalty, in short, acts of devotion,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   loving kindness that go on beyond the requirements of duty."
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   This is the type of love David understood,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   a covenant loving kindness that David declared was better and more meaningful than life itself.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   David was so moved and overwhelmed by the greatness of God's love.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   He tasted it. He knew it, the vastness and worth of it.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Do we know God like that?
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Do we love God more than life itself?
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Do we really know his chesed love?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Of course, loving God more than life doesn't have to end in anything as dramatic as martyrdom,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   but really knowing God's love means we do not give up on God,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   even when things do not go as we had hoped.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   I think we would all agree that things have not gone as we would have hoped or imagined these past two years.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Do I hear an amen?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Do I hear an amen online?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   No one would have anticipated how our city would have fragmented in the protests of 2019
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   and how fears for our future have led so many to leave or think about leaving Hong Kong,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   or how COVID would impact us all in different ways that we are still yet really able to fully comprehend.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I know we all have a story to tell where things have not gone as we would have hoped or we would have planned.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   We too find ourselves in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   In July 2019, as one of the senior leaders of this church, with Andrew away on sabbatical, much needed sabbatical,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   it was a very challenging time for us to navigate through the unrest unfolding in the city,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   the impact on our staff and on you, our congregation.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   There were times when Wan Chai was literally on fire and ensuring the safety of our people was a priority.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   And at the same time, knowing that God had called us to be a light in this city,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   a place of refuge and a place for restoration.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   The streets were full of hurting people.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   So walking in that tension, dealing with the many differences, was not easy.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And then during this time when I needed to be focused, sharp, on the ball, able to make lots of decisions, I got sick.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   For weeks I lived in a fog of pain that often brought me to my knees in agony.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And for those of you that suffer with pain, you'll know what I mean.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   There were times I ended up, well twice I ended up in A&E.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And honestly, every day was just a survival, taking pain medication to get through that time.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I didn't understand why I was suffering this way.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   I had a job to do, a church to help lead, a family to raise.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   But yet, through this time, the protests and the pain, I learned to be completely dependent on God.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   By seeking his presence, his love sustained me.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And looking back, I see the many different ways that he carried me through this difficult time.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   At the start of the pandemic, my son was hit by a bus.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Every parent's worst nightmare.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   A call that told us our son had been in an accident and it was serious.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Honestly, it's a miracle he survived.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   He was on his bike, riding down the road, the hill, when a bus on the other side of the road overtook another vehicle and didn't see Ben.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   It was a head-on collision.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Ben was rushed to hospital and thankfully, 18 months later, he's made a full recovery.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Yay!
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   But it was a terrifying time.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   And COVID restrictions didn't help.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   It meant that we were unable to be with him as he was kept in hospital for a week.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   I did what I could only do.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   I sought the presence of God as I knew only he would be able to sustain me through this.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   This was out of my control.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And he did.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   He carried us as a family through this dark period.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And then just six weeks ago, we find ourselves once again waiting outside an operation theater.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   This time it's our daughter who had to go through major surgery.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I've known God's faithfulness to us as a family in the past.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   And this time would be no different.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   I turned to God once again to be in his presence, to allow him to minister to my weariness and fears.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I pursued his presence on my daily runs or in my quiet moments as I travel to work on a ferry.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   I sought his presence in the middle of the night when I could not sleep.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   I knew his presence in my time here at church, gathered with you, worshipping, listening to God's word.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Praise God, our daughter is recovering well.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Our family has ridden the roller coaster of emotions, but even in the hard circumstances,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   I see God's care and love for our family.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And God wants you to know this love too.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   It's in the good times, but it's in those difficult times too.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And like me, David's meditation on God's enduring and committed love was often through the night.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   You know, the slow advancing hours after midnight.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   David said, "On my bed I remember you.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   I think of you through the watches of the night."
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Often insights of who God is and his love come at night.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Do we give God this time?
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   How often do we really slow down to remember all that God has done?
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Are we woken at night because God wants to talk to us?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Is it the only time we are really still?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Do we allow space for his presence to meet with us during that night watch?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   There have been many times that I've been unable to sleep, and I found myself on my knees,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   sometimes praying, sometimes simply remembering God's faithfulness to me and my family.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Sometimes it's simply in awe of who God is.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I remember one night in the early hours of the morning, I was woken up with a strong urge to pray.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   And as I knelt at the end of my bed, I suddenly felt such a strong presence of God in the room.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   I was profoundly aware of my own sinfulness and God's holiness.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   It was overwhelming, and yet it gave me a glimpse, a little bit more of who God is.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   God in his holiness, his power, his glory.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And just for a few moments, I was deeply afraid.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   But then that flood of reassurance, of knowing that because of Jesus and his blood,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   I can enter God's presence, and I do not need to be afraid.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   When we take the time to meditate on what God has done for us in the past,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   when we witness his power at work in the present,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   when we understand his love,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   we are sustained to have the confidence that our future is secure, no matter what it may bring.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   So how do we pursue God to know him?
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   We do it by meditating on his love, his goodness for our lives.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   David's confession and meditation led him to a place of satisfaction.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And that has been true in my life.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   I know God. I'm assured of his love. I know that he delivers me.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   And David knows that too. He knows he will be delivered.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And the last verses, they appear to be quite a pivot in their tone and focus.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   But really, David is concluding with the assurance and knowledge that God will avenge him
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   because of God's love and faithfulness.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   David is confident that God will deliver him from his enemies.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   "They who seek my life will be destroyed.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   They will go down to the depths of the earth.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   But the king will rejoice in God.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   All who swear by God's name will praise him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced."
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Knowing God is our deliverance also brings us to a place of trusting God
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   with the things that at times appear too big, too overwhelming.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   But God will have his way.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   There will be his justice.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   There is his chesed, love.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   God wants you to know his presence.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   He wants you to know his love.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   For some of you, you need to choose to trust Jesus.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   It's as simple as that.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   It is not about money.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   It is not about job satisfaction.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It is not about having a relationship or a family that will bring you that satisfaction.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   It is only Jesus.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   For some of us today, we need to desire more to be in his presence and experience his love.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And you know, as I prepared for this sermon and as I was thinking,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   I don't want you to leave here remembering the stories.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   I want you to leave here with a hunger for more of God in your life.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   We may have grown cold or distant.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Some of us will have been Christians for a long time.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Maybe just that busyness of life has kept us,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   or maybe the hope or loss of hope or fears or the anxiety that comes and seems to be overtaking us.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Maybe we've just become too busy with the routine of life that we put it on the list of things to do,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   but we never get around to actually doing it.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So let's choose to pursue his presence more.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Ask God to meet with you.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Take time to be in his presence so that he can reveal his love to you.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Give him time.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Sit in his presence, and you will come to know his love that truly is better than life.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   So would you join me as we stand?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   I would love to pray for us.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Again, as I said, my heart, my prayer is that we leave this place with a hunger to know God.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Our city needs to know God.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   You're a light in this city.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   If you're watching online, wherever you are, we need to hunger for more of God.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   That will take us to a place where we do not feel that we cannot deal with the things that we are dealing with.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   His chesed love will hold us.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   His holiness will transform us.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   So as I pray with you, wherever you are at, I pray that you open up your heart
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   so that these words don't just be nice words and the stories good, encouraging stories,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   but something is sown in your spirit.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Something takes you deeper, that longing for God, and you leave here so that Monday to Sunday,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   you know the presence of God in your life.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   So Father, I thank you.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   As we enter into your presence now and as we have that opportunity to respond,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   I firstly pray for anyone here that does not know Jesus.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I pray that that stirring in their heart right now, the conviction of your spirit,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   will give them the courage and the boldness to take that step of faith.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Take that step of faith to choose to follow Jesus, to choose to make your allegiance with Jesus alone.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   You cannot have Jesus and a multitude of other gods too.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   You must choose allegiance to Jesus alone.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Father, as we pray, and as that person, those people choose you,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I thank you for your spirit will step to be with them to transform their lives.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   And if that is you, then please after the service, come down, talk to me, talk to a pastor, talk to a friend.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Let us pray with you as you journey, continue your journey.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   And Father, I lift to you my brothers and sisters in here, and my brothers and sisters online, wherever you may be.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And Father, I pray that you would stir in us a passion to pursue you.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   As David longed for you, even for more than life itself.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   I pray for that revelation of your chesed love in this place.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Chesed love for those at home. Chesed love in the city of Hong Kong.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   We need it. Our children need it. Our youth need it.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Chesed love, Father, found in your presence.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Chesed love that allows us to know you more and more.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Chesed love that is transformative.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   So Father, thank you. We will hunger for your presence.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   We will choose our allegiance to you. We will confess you as Lord.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   And we will spend time to meditate, knowing that you are so faithful, so very faithful.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   And we pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen.
