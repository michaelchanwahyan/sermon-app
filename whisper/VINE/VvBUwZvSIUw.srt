1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
 - Good morning.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,260
 - And good morning to all of those

3
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,300
 who are joining online today.

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,380
 As Carla just said, we started a new series last week

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,940
 on the Holy Spirit, and I loved how Andrew focused in on

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,820
 and reminded us that the Holy Spirit is a person.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,680
 And the Holy Spirit is a person whose role,

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,020
 since the very beginning of creation,

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,760
 has always been to bring order out of disorder.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,660
 That beautiful picture in Genesis of the Holy Spirit

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,500
 hovering over the darkness and the chaos,

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
 ready to bring things fully alive.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,660
 And now, for those of us who've chosen Jesus,

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,960
 He's at work within us.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,420
 The Holy Spirit willing and ready to move us out of darkness,

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,700
 to shape our chaos into the fullness

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,880
 of what we were intended to be.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,020
 Today, we're going to explore the comfort

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,320
 and the conviction of the Holy Spirit.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,020
 John 14, verses 16 to 17 says,

21
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,740
 "And I will pray the Father,

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,700
 "and He will give you another helper,

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,380
 "and He may abide with you forever,

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,800
 "the Spirit of truth,

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,480
 "whom the world cannot receive

26
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,000
 "because it neither sees Him nor knows Him,

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,600
 "but you know Him, for He dwells with you

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,780
 "and will be in you."

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,420
 John 14, verse 26 says, "But the helper,

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,700
 "the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,

31
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,380
 "He will teach you all things,

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,180
 "and bring to your remembrance

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,020
 "all things that I said to you."

34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,160
 And then in John 16, verses seven to eight, it says,

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,140
 "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth.

36
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,140
 "It is to your advantage that I go away.

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,920
 "For if I do not go away, the helper will not come to you.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,580
 "But if I depart, I will send him to you,

39
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,260
 "and when he has come, he will convict the world of sin,

40
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,740
 "of righteousness, and of judgment."

41
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,260
 All three verses use the word helper

42
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,320
 to describe the Holy Spirit.

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,860
 The Greek word is parakletos,

44
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,760
 which translates as comforter or advocate.

45
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,500
 Someone who is called or sent to assist another.

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,820
 Someone who pleads the cause of another.

47
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:59,100
 Someone who's present to render various beneficial services.

48
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:06,100
 John would later, in 1 John 2, 1,

49
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,100
 use the very same word, parakletos, to describe Jesus.

50
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,900
 This connection has meaning.

51
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,740
 Jesus' words in John 16, seven to eight,

52
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,740
 tell us that Jesus is leaving behind his earthly ministry,

53
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,940
 specifically so the Holy Spirit can act.

54
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,980
 The Holy Spirit, in a sense, does from the inside

55
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,380
 what Christ was doing from the outside with his disciples.

56
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,020
 Teaching, convicting, reminding, comforting, and guiding.

57
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,060
 Let's unpack these verses.

58
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,140
 Sometimes, if you've been a Christian for a little while,

59
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,060
 it's easy to gloss over these verses

60
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,780
 and miss the enormity of what is taking place here.

61
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,380
 John 14, 16 to seven, teaches us

62
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,420
 that the Holy Spirit is given to us by the Father.

63
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,580
 That he will abide in us forever.

64
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,060
 He will dwell with us.

65
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,660
 He will be in us.

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,420
 If you believe in Jesus,

67
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,620
 if you've recognised your need of his saving love,

68
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,820
 and have chosen to give him your life,

69
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,680
 you have been given the gift

70
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,620
 of the Holy Spirit from the Father.

71
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,360
 The Holy Spirit is living within you.

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,020
 And this verse tells us that he will never leave you.

73
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,820
 He will abide with you forever.

74
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,900
 This Greek word abide, meno, means to remain,

75
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,640
 to stay, to continue to exist.

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,980
 And I love this last word.

77
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,380
 It means to persist.

78
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,040
 I don't know about you,

79
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,340
 but I'm glad I have someone dwelling with me

80
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,540
 who persists with me and doesn't give up on me.

81
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,460
 Jesus said, "It's to your advantage that I go away."

82
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,220
 Let's think about that for a minute.

83
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,020
 Jesus is saying that we get a better deal

84
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,420
 if he leaves and the Holy Spirit comes.

85
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,900
 It's to our advantage.

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,300
 I'm sure the disciples who were listening to this

87
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,000
 would have been thinking, "That just can't be right."

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,360
 How can it be better if you go?

89
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,600
 How can it be better if you go?

90
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,080
 You see, as long as Jesus was there in person,

91
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,920
 the object of the disciples' faith

92
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,600
 would always be a tangible, external person.

93
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,760
 Now, that's not necessarily bad.

94
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,680
 However, it means that they would have constantly

95
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,680
 depended on him to direct them to answer their questions.

96
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,320
 Their own thoughts and conscience

97
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,480
 would be perpetually pushed aside

98
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,640
 in favor of asking Jesus for his judgment

99
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,780
 and what he thought.

100
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,800
 When he was not physically present with them,

101
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,240
 they would have felt incomplete.

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,560
 In short, Jesus' physical presence, in some sense,

103
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,200
 limited the depth of the disciples' reliance on God.

104
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,480
 It limited also how many people

105
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,700
 Jesus could influence at once.

106
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,200
 The Holy Spirit, on the other hand,

107
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,200
 completely fulfills the prophecy that's given in Jeremiah 31.

108
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,700
 It says, "Behold, the days are coming," declares the Lord,

109
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,960
 "when I will make a new covenant

110
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,460
 "with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.

111
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,720
 "I will put my law within them,

112
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,760
 "and I will write it on their hearts.

113
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,440
 "And I will be their God, they'll be my people.

114
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,360
 "And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,720
 "and each his brother saying, 'Know the Lord,'

116
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,640
 "for they shall all know me.

117
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,020
 "From the least of them to the greatest," declares the Lord,

118
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,420
 "for I will forgive their iniquity,

119
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,480
 "and I will remember their sin no more."

120
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,860
 The Holy Spirit, the helper,

121
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,920
 provides the ability for each of us

122
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,960
 to have a constant, a personal,

123
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,800
 an immediate, and indwelling contact with God.

124
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,360
 Instead of relying on someone outside of ourselves,

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,320
 believers in Christ can focus on the voice of God inside,

126
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,200
 inside their hearts as he dwells with them.

127
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:57,260
 Now, this doesn't make us infallible or all-knowing.

128
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,640
 It does mean that we have the advantage of his influence

129
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,760
 so far as we're willing to submit to it.

130
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,440
 Paul puts it like this,

131
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,500
 "Our bodies have now become the temple of the Holy Spirit."

132
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,440
 So as our helper, the Holy Spirit has this dual purpose

133
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,460
 to both comfort and convict.

134
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,920
 These words may seem to be opposites,

135
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,260
 but in fact, they can be intertwined.

136
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,160
 The conviction of the Holy Spirit in our response

137
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,100
 leads to his comfort

138
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,020
 and the work of his comfort in our lives.

139
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,320
 A key thing to really note here is

140
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,620
 we can carry the Holy Spirit within us,

141
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,360
 and he will be actively working

142
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,960
 to both convict and comfort us.

143
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,100
 But it only works if we're listening.

144
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,340
 It only works if we're responding and submitting to him.

145
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,740
 It's also important to note

146
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,780
 that the comforting work of the Spirit

147
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,420
 isn't always connected to conviction.

148
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,960
 Sometimes he comforts us because we're brokenhearted,

149
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,460
 or we've experienced loss, or we're lonely,

150
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,100
 or sometimes he brings his comfort

151
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,120
 through us for somebody else.

152
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,520
 After one of the Sunday messages,

153
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,720
 I was having lunch across the road here

154
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,600
 in the little Malaysian place,

155
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,380
 'cause I love their rendang there,

156
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,960
 just a bit of a shout out.

157
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,900
 And I happened to be there by myself.

158
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,580
 Normally I'm having lunch with my family,

159
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,240
 but on this day I was by myself.

160
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,800
 And I'm just sitting there eating my lunch,

161
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,440
 and I'm getting ready about to stand up

162
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,880
 and go pay for my meal.

163
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,180
 And the Holy Spirit just said,

164
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,900
 "You see that lady next to you?

165
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,460
 And I looked over,

166
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,540
 and I could tell it was one of our helpers,

167
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,020
 you know, like somebody who is a domestic worker

168
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,860
 working in Hong Kong, Sunday being their day off.

169
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,540
 She was sitting there relaxing, looking at her phone.

170
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,980
 Her bill for her dinner was just sitting on the table,

171
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,660
 and the Holy Spirit said, "Pay for her dinner."

172
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,940
 And I was like,

173
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,660
 the paying part wasn't the issue,

174
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,900
 the part was I didn't know this person,

175
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,340
 she was a stranger.

176
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,140
 And for a moment I really wrestled,

177
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,980
 'cause I thought I'm gonna be embarrassed,

178
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,020
 like talking to a complete stranger and saying,

179
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,620
 "Oh, can I pay for your dinner?"

180
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,900
 And I wrestled for quite a while,

181
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,300
 I sat there and I was like, "Mm."

182
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,860
 But eventually I gave in, I stood up,

183
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,740
 and as I passed this woman's table I said,

184
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,620
 "Is it all right if I pay for your meal today?"

185
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,240
 She kind of looked at me like in shock,

186
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,260
 and I actually picked it up off the table

187
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,780
 and started walking towards the cashier.

188
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:03,120
 And she sort of got up and started following me.

189
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,820
 It was very awkward.

190
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,500
 And she said to me, "But why, why, why?"

191
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,060
 And I could have given her a whole Christian thing,

192
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,620
 I didn't.

193
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,100
 I just said, "Just because, 'cause I can."

194
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,340
 And she said to me, "Can I give you a hug?"

195
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:32,220
 The Holy Spirit was doing that not for my benefit,

196
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,660
 he was comforting her, he was bringing her to a place,

197
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,920
 even though she was giving me a hug,

198
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,300
 she, it was like the Holy Spirit was hugging her

199
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,360
 and letting her know that she was seen.

200
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,160
 So sometimes the Holy Spirit works his comfort through us

201
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,320
 if we're willing to listen, and not just listen but obey.

202
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,940
 Let's look at the convicting work of the Holy Spirit.

203
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,420
 Jesus said, "The Holy Spirit will teach you all things

204
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,420
 "and bring to your remembrance all the things I said to you.

205
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,540
 "He will convict the world of sin

206
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,060
 "and of righteousness and of judgment."

207
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,020
 Let me give you an example of the convicting work

208
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,160
 of the Holy Spirit.

209
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,380
 When I was a teenager, my mum and dad made it clear

210
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,320
 that they did not want me dating until I was 16 years old.

211
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,220
 And they wanted me to choose someone

212
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,180
 who held similar Christian values.

213
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,580
 They would always tell me about that whole

214
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,860
 unevenly yoked thing, you know?

215
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,220
 The oxen pulling the plow and how they'd put the harness

216
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,220
 over the shoulders, and if the oxen weren't the same height,

217
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,080
 one of the oxen would carry more of the load.

218
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,380
 And they would always tell me, you know,

219
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,420
 if you go out with someone who doesn't share

220
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,100
 the same values, it's gonna be like that.

221
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,860
 There's gonna be times when you're gonna feel

222
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,660
 under pressure, and things are not gonna work out so well.

223
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,240
 Well, there were a number of times I broke these rules.

224
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,980
 In fact, my first boyfriend was when I was 11.

225
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,680
 Nowhere near the 16 years of age.

226
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,560
 But you know, every time without fail,

227
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,480
 I would be convicted by the Holy Spirit.

228
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,200
 I remember once I was sitting in the backseat of a car

229
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,200
 holding a boy's hand, and my stomach was churning.

230
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,840
 I can remember literally feeling physically ill.

231
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,400
 And I could hear a very persistent voice in my head

232
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,880
 saying, "This is not okay.

233
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,820
 "This is not the right person for you.

234
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,240
 "You need to end this."

235
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,920
 This didn't just happen once.

236
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,160
 I'm a slow learner.

237
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,960
 It happened many times.

238
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,760
 And I became aware at these moments

239
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,120
 that my parents were praying for me.

240
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,120
 And this is a good time to just encourage

241
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,560
 all the parents here.

242
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,880
 Do not stop praying for your children.

243
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 The Holy Spirit is at work even when you are not around.

244
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,240
 You know, I would experience no peace

245
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,760
 until I relented and I responded

246
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,480
 and I ended the relationship.

247
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,520
 Recently, I've been joking around

248
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,440
 with my teaching partner at school.

249
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,060
 And I made some comments about a staff member.

250
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,400
 The next morning, driving to school, having a quiet time,

251
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,560
 the Holy Spirit convicted me of this conversation.

252
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,740
 He reminded me of who he was calling me to be,

253
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,280
 a person of encouragement.

254
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,480
 And he encouraged me to speak to my teaching partner

255
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,800
 when I got to school,

256
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,720
 to apologize to her and tell her

257
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
 that I shouldn't have been talking

258
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,600
 about this person behind her back.

259
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,820
 And that from now on, I was going to endeavor

260
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,320
 to not do that again.

261
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,660
 The Holy Spirit reminds us of the person

262
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,200
 we are meant to be.

263
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,380
 He convicts us of sin and righteousness.

264
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,020
 He reminds us of the right way to live.

265
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,760
 As Andrew explained to us last week,

266
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,120
 the Holy Spirit has that great purpose

267
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,120
 of bringing something from disorder to order in our lives.

268
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,940
 And one of the key ways he does this

269
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,560
 is through his conviction.

270
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,220
 He helps us to recognize when we are not living

271
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,640
 as the person he's created us to be.

272
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,060
 When we believe in and accept Jesus as our Savior,

273
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,740
 he covers us with his righteousness.

274
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,540
 He covers us with his goodness.

275
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,220
 The Holy Spirit holds us accountable.

276
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,600
 He reminds us that we are sons and daughters of God

277
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,000
 and we are called to reflect his light

278
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,520
 and goodness in the world.

279
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,880
 The conviction of the Holy Spirit only works,

280
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,980
 as I said before, if we listen and respond to it.

281
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,620
 You see, the more we hear and we don't respond,

282
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,960
 the duller the voice of the Holy Spirit gets.

283
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,880
 Eventually we'll reach a point where we won't hear at all.

284
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,600
 Ezekiel 12, two describes this.

285
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,640
 Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house,

286
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,940
 which has eyes to see but does not see,

287
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,860
 and ears to hear but does not hear.

288
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,740
 For they are a rebellious house.

289
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:22,220
 Many of us have stopped listening for many reasons,

290
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,980
 but mostly because we don't want to respond

291
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,600
 to what we hear.

292
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,940
 You see, it's easier making our own choices

293
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,180
 and living the way we want to live.

294
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,000
 But James warns us about what happens

295
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,300
 when we live like this.

296
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,580
 James 1, verses 23 to 24 says,

297
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,900
 if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer,

298
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,220
 he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror.

299
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,660
 For he observes himself, he goes away,

300
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,660
 and he immediately forgets what kind of man he was.

301
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,820
 You see, when we stop listening and responding

302
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,680
 to the voice and the work of the Holy Spirit,

303
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,220
 we forget what kind of person we are meant to be,

304
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,440
 and we lose our true identity.

305
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,580
 Now we're going to speak about the comfort

306
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,780
 of the Holy Spirit.

307
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:34,820
 The Holy Spirit assists us, he counsels us,

308
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,000
 he advocates for us.

309
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,220
 As I was preparing this sermon,

310
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,740
 I was reminded of this moment in my life.

311
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,620
 I was 17 and my boyfriend had just broken up with me.

312
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,260
 Seems to be a theme this morning,

313
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,320
 doesn't it, all my boyfriend stories?

314
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,760
 But this one, he had broken up with me,

315
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,280
 and I had been going out with him for a year and a half,

316
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,820
 it wasn't just a month or something,

317
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,880
 and I sincerely thought that we would continue

318
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,280
 and eventually one day get married.

319
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,220
 I was sitting on my bed and I was experiencing

320
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,960
 inconsolable grief.

321
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,700
 And my father walked into the room,

322
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,060
 he sat down beside me on my bed,

323
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:25,080
 he put his arm around me and he said three words.

324
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:31,060
 It's his loss.

325
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,760
 It's his loss.

326
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,460
 I'll never forget that moment.

327
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:43,120
 The comfort and belief I received from those three words.

328
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,880
 It was like my dad restored my value.

329
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,440
 He helped me to see myself through his eyes.

330
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,120
 This is what the Holy Spirit does for us.

331
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,120
 The Holy Spirit restores our value.

332
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,740
 And he helps us to see ourselves truly

333
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,320
 as we were created to be.

334
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,740
 Some of you here today,

335
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,900
 you are going through big and difficult things.

336
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,580
 20 years ago, my husband, Glenn, and I,

337
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,280
 we moved to Darwin in Australia.

338
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,900
 Our friends had gone to pastor there,

339
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,020
 and they asked us to join them.

340
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,500
 And at first we said, no.

341
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,700
 If you know where Darwin is,

342
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,300
 it's like the northwest tip up the top of Australia.

343
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,900
 It is isolated.

344
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,740
 You've either got to drive 24 hours to get somewhere

345
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,580
 or you fly.

346
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,180
 Like it is the back of beyond.

347
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,620
 And so when they said this,

348
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,100
 our pastor friend Darren, he actually,

349
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,180
 "I had a dream about you and you were in Darwin."

350
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,420
 And we were like, no, no, no, no, no.

351
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,640
 That can't be right.

352
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,680
 However, we respected them enough to go and visit them.

353
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,060
 So we went and we visited.

354
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,020
 And while we were there, both my husband and I,

355
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,220
 I remember we were driving in the car,

356
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,260
 heading out to one of the national parks.

357
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,840
 And I said, "Oh, what are you thinking?"

358
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,780
 And he said, "I think we're meant to be here."

359
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,480
 And I went, "Yeah, me too."

360
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,840
 So we packed up our four kids and we moved to Darwin.

361
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,980
 And we actually lived with Darren and Kim

362
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,180
 for a number of weeks because we were searching

363
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,980
 for a house to rent.

364
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,420
 And it took some time.

365
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,060
 And I remember we had meals with them.

366
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,140
 Darren loved to cook on the barbecues.

367
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,060
 So we'd sit outside beside their pool

368
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,660
 and we'd barbecue together and have meals.

369
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,600
 And it was a really beautiful time.

370
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,220
 We'd only been in Darwin six months.

371
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,300
 And our pastor, our friend, our mentor, Darren,

372
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,900
 was killed in a car crash.

373
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,240
 In fact, he had just been with my husband.

374
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,060
 Darren had visited him where my husband worked

375
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,540
 and they'd chatted.

376
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,340
 He'd given Glenn a hug, hopped into his car,

377
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,360
 and about a kilometre away was hit by a big truck

378
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,160
 that just flattened the car.

379
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:21,220
 And I remember going to Kim's house that night

380
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,280
 and sitting on her bed.

381
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,980
 And we were just weeping together.

382
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,580
 And then she said,

383
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,100
 "God must have something pretty amazing planned

384
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,080
 "to come out of all of this."

385
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,780
 The gentle whispers and encouragement of the Holy Spirit,

386
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,220
 it didn't alter the heart-wrenching loss

387
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,720
 and it didn't change the circumstances.

388
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,500
 But I remember in the weeks and months that followed,

389
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,960
 months that should have been filled with chaos and despair,

390
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,000
 instead were filled with comfort.

391
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,820
 And we were given the strength and grace to lean in

392
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,980
 instead of lean away.

393
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,060
 We experienced, the church there experienced

394
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,420
 the deep levels of comfort that held us and carried us.

395
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:29,860
 Andrew spoke last week of leaning into the person

396
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,680
 and the work of the Holy Spirit.

397
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,700
 In the last church-wide prayer and worship night

398
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,900
 that we held here,

399
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,860
 a word was given to us,

400
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,940
 a picture of what the Holy Spirit is doing amongst us.

401
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,540
 The picture was of a heart that had become hardened.

402
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,900
 It was encased in stone.

403
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,180
 But then the stone began to crack

404
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,960
 and it looked like eggshell.

405
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,860
 And then the work of the Holy Spirit came like water,

406
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:08,500
 coming and lifting the stone and washing it away.

407
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,700
 And as it did that, it revealed the red beating hearts

408
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,960
 of who we are truly meant to be,

409
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,280
 the fully alive version of ourselves.

410
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,780
 2 Corinthians 3:17 reminds us

411
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,000
 that where the Spirit of the Lord is working,

412
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,260
 He brings freedom.

413
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:39,420
 Now we are going to get practical.

414
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,540
 And I know all the introverts are cringing,

415
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,300
 thinking, do I have to connect with someone?

416
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,980
 No, you don't, only the Holy Spirit.

417
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,820
 We are going to slow down

418
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,540
 and we are going to listen to the convicting voice

419
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,100
 of the Holy Spirit.

420
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,220
 You can use your phones,

421
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,220
 you can use your old school like me, your journal.

422
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:09,580
 You're going to write down whatever you hear

423
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,460
 and you're not going to overthink it.

424
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,060
 We have a great way of discounting

425
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,100
 the voice of the Holy Spirit.

426
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,020
 He speaks, we go, that can't be,

427
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,140
 that can't be the Holy Spirit.

428
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,600
 Whatever you hear, write it down.

429
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,880
 We are going to respond, so we're not only going to listen,

430
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,040
 but we're going to respond to what we hear.

431
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,020
 It's His kindness that leads us to repentance.

432
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,100
 You need to know that He comes,

433
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,980
 that His conviction comes with kindness.

434
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:53,260
 We're going to sit in what we hear

435
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,580
 and we're going to respond from our hearts.

436
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:05,100
 This isn't going to be about me,

437
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,020
 it's not going to be about any of the leadership here,

438
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,300
 this is a moment just for you and the Holy Spirit.

439
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,780
 Now maybe you're here today and you're not a Christian

440
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,220
 and you're thinking, well, this is going to be a waste

441
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,060
 of my time.

442
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:25,780
 Actually, you need to know that God

443
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,900
 has a real soft spot for you.

444
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,940
 In the Bible, there's a whole story

445
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,540
 where He leaves all the people who already know Him

446
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,900
 and He goes and searches for the one that's lost.

447
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,700
 (gentle music)

448
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,820
 So actually, this time is more for you

449
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,860
 than any other person in this room.

450
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,700
 You see, He's still speaking to you,

451
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,340
 even if you don't know Him yet.

452
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,120
 You can still hear Him.

453
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,140
 So now we're going to take some time.

454
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,880
 Just you and the Holy Spirit.

455
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,820
 Imagine like my dad sitting beside me

456
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,940
 with his arm draped over me.

457
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,660
 That's how the Holy Spirit comes to us in gentleness.

458
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,980
 He sits beside us and He whispers

459
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:25,220
 and He reminds us of things that we need to hear,

460
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,820
 things we need to fix,

461
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,220
 things we need to let go of.

462
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:38,460
 So now, take this moment to listen.

463
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,020
 Don't get distracted.

464
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:54,820
 If you're online, I hope that you are doing this

465
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
 with us as well.

466
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,980
 We invite you to join with us.

467
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,140
 And now we're gonna take some time to sit

468
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,220
 in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.

469
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,860
 And we're gonna continue to listen to His gentle whispers

470
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,700
 and we're not going to rush.

471
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:19,300
 Once again, whatever you hear,

472
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,900
 you're gonna write it down and you're gonna sit.

473
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,720
 Just sit in His presence.

474
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,420
 Last night as I was sleeping,

475
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,300
 I was kind of in and out of sleep

476
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,140
 as I was thinking about today.

477
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,140
 And I think my mind was worried about being prepared

478
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:49,260
 and through it all, I just heard the Holy Spirit say,

479
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,260
 "Susanna, my presence is not dependent

480
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,140
 "on your preparedness.

481
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:02,740
 "My presence is determined by your welcome."

482
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,900
 And I was thinking about that on the bus on the way in

483
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,900
 and I looked up the Hebrew word for welcome.

484
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:19,220
 And it means to bless the one who comes.

485
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:26,420
 And I thought, whoa, so many times I look to be blessed.

486
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,180
 But how many times have I blessed the Holy Spirit

487
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,580
 by making room for Him

488
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,340
 and blessing Him with my time

489
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,100
 and blessing Him with my attention

490
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,800
 and blessing Him with my obedience?

491
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,640
 So today as we listen to His comfort,

492
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:58,460
 choose to welcome Him, to make space.

493
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,860
 He's with you already, but He's a gentleman.

494
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,660
 He only goes as far as we allow Him.

495
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,820
 So welcome Him.

496
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,980
 Make space.

497
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,940
 Let your ears be attentive

498
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,380
 to what He is speaking into your life right now.

499
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:23,980
 The worship team is gonna come,

500
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,900
 but we are not ending this.

501
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,480
 (gentle music)

502
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:39,700
 The Holy Spirit reminded me of a moment

503
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:46,860
 when I was a teenager and I was in a Christian conference

504
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,080
 for teenagers.

505
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,980
 And the person who was preaching,

506
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,700
 I was standing at the altar call

507
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,100
 and he looked at me and he said,

508
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,460
 "The Holy Spirit is hovering over your life."

509
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,780
 And in that moment, I didn't fully understand

510
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,900
 what that meant, but I do now

511
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,740
 because the Holy Spirit across my life

512
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,740
 has been slowly bringing all the disorder into order.

513
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,020
 Taking all the broken pieces and weaving His gold

514
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,020
 between those broken pieces and remaking this part,

515
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:43,160
 giving me a beautiful story to tell.

516
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:50,160
 The Holy Spirit is hovering over all our lives.

517
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,500
 And this is not a moment just to be had and forgotten,

518
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,860
 but a moment to be carried into your everyday.

519
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,920
 You see, it doesn't matter if you're on a bus

520
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,920
 or driving a car or having a shower or washing the dishes.

521
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,560
 He's present with you.

522
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,280
 So welcome Him and listen.

523
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:33,320
 He's working to make you

524
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:41,360
 the splitting image of Jesus.

525
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,400
 He's working to make you like Jesus.

526
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:50,160
 He's working to restore

527
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,360
 the broken pieces of your life.

528
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:01,360
 But it only works if we listen and we obey.

529
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,840
 So make this a daily thing

530
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,040
 where you're stopping and you're listening

531
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,600
 and you're responding.

532
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,720
 He's your best friend,

533
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,580
 He will convict you and He will comfort you.

534
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:34,520
 Father, we just all come to you right now and

535
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:42,480
 we carry such brokenness sometimes, God,

536
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,400
 such disorder and chaos at times.

537
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,980
 Holy Spirit, teach us to slow down,

538
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,800
 teach us to remove distractions

539
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,480
 and do the one thing that's needed

540
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,400
 to sit with you in your presence

541
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,740
 and listen and respond.

542
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:14,280
 We commit ourselves to you and we ask

543
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,280
 that we will have the courage to respond

544
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,960
 to the things that you talk to us about today.

545
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,880
 Father, if you've challenged some of us

546
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,680
 to be more generous with our time or money,

547
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,560
 give us the courage to respond.

548
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,400
 If you've challenged us to restore

549
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,240
 a broken relationship with your help,

550
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,560
 give us the courage to love well.

551
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,500
 If you've encouraged us to let things go,

552
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,520
 (gentle music)

553
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,820
 whatever that may be,

554
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,760
 to make more space and room.

555
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,380
 If you've told us to say no to a relationship

556
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,460
 because it's not the right one for us,

557
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,740
 give us courage.

558
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:12,820
 Help us to walk these things out

559
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,460
 that you've spoken to us about today

560
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,080
 and rest in the comfort that comes when we do respond.

561
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,860
 We just thank you for loving us

562
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:29,700
 and walking with us and persisting with us.

563
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,540
 Thank you.

564
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:40,540
