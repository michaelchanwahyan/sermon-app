[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Have a seat.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   So in this penultimate week of our Exodus series,
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.600]   this saga of a series that we've been in for 25 weeks or whatever it is,
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.800]   we come to the moment where Israel finally departs from Mount Sinai
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.600]   and begins to head towards the Promised Land,
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.000]   a place that has been promised to them for generations and generations.
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.800]   Up to this point in the narrative, Israel has actually been camped at Mount Sinai for a year.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.800]   They've been there for almost a year.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.600]   And when they arrived at Mount Sinai,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.800]   we've seen over the last number of weeks here at the Vine
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.500]   that they arrived free but stripped of their identity.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.300]   They didn't really know who they were now called to be in freedom.
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.000]   And we've been seeing in this series that that's so often the case for us,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.300]   that Christ frees us from our sin,
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.800]   but we find ourselves wondering who are we now in this freedom?
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.500]   How should we now live in our freedom?
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.700]   And we saw that God began to speak to Israel deeply about that journey
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.900]   that they're in now to discover who they truly are.
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.000]   He spoke to them about being a holy nation,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.800]   about being a kingdom of priests.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.500]   He spoke to them about the idea of a law that should be amongst them,
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.800]   a law that we come to understand as the Ten Commandments and the Mosaic Law,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.800]   but it's a law that at its very core is structured to help us to have a relationship with God,
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.200]   a relationship with ourselves,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600]   and then a relationship with the people around us.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.200]   And out of all of this identity forming Israel,
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200]   who are trying to be by God shaped into a people
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.700]   that could be his hands and feet in the world,
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.000]   Israel struggles straight away.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.800]   And we saw a few weeks ago that they fall into idolatry,
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.000]   the second commandment that God says,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.800]   "Don't make an idol, don't make an image."
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.000]   They fall into that reality very quickly.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.400]   And in that place of idolatry,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.500]   they begin to live out an identity that wasn't the identity that God had called them to be.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.200]   And so God shows up and he asks them a critical question,
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   out of this travesty of idolatry.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   He says, "Do you want my presence with you or not?"
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.500]   And last week we wrestled with that question for ourselves.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.800]   Do we really want God's presence?
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   Do we want his promises more than we want his presence in our lives?
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.500]   And so Israel are brought to a crossroads where they have to make a decision.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.800]   Are we going to go forward with God's presence,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   or will we walk into the promises but leave God behind?
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.000]   And Moses, on behalf of all of Israel, stands up in front of the people,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.700]   and he says to God out loud,
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.900]   he says, "If you do not go with us, we will not move from this place."
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.300]   In other words, it is you or it is nothing.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.400]   That we have nothing to offer this world,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.800]   we have nothing that differentiates us from everybody else in this world,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   unless you go with us.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.300]   Your presence, your forgiveness, your power, your grace, your love,
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.500]   is what this world needs.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.300]   The world doesn't need us as a people, Moses is saying.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   The world needs you.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.300]   And if you're with us,
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.500]   then we can be that hands and feet that you've called us to be.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.800]   And we saw last week that that's the cry of our heart as the church too.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.200]   That we have nothing to offer Hong Kong,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.700]   we've got nothing to offer our families that don't know Jesus.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.700]   We've got nothing unless God is with us.
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.300]   It is His presence, His power, His grace, His love,
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.500]   that transforms us into a people that can then offer the world something,
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   founded in the person of Jesus.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   Amen?
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   And so Israel, they depart from Mount Sinai with this hope on their hearts,
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.300]   that God indeed is going to go with them.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.900]   And if God is going to go with them,
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.900]   not only would they receive the promises,
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.300]   but they will be shaped into a community that can reveal His heart
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.500]   to the many, many people that so desperately need it.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.100]   What's interesting for the readers of the book of Exodus
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.100]   is that the rest of the story of Exodus actually exists outside of its pages.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.700]   In fact, as we saw last week in chapter 33,
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.500]   where God challenged them with His presence,
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.900]   from chapter 34 to 40, the remaining chapters of the book,
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.300]   God reemphasizes to them about the stone tablets that God had given Moses,
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.100]   about the construction of the tabernacle,
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.900]   about His sense of glory amongst them.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.700]   There's no other story, if you will, that happens in the book of Exodus.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.300]   That story is picked up now in the book of Numbers and in Deuteronomy.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.300]   And in two weeks' time, when we finish our series on November 26,
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.700]   we'll look at the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.900]   Today, we're going to look briefly at the book of Numbers.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.500]   Because Numbers picks up exactly from where Exodus finishes off.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.300]   And in Numbers, we begin to see the journey that moves forward for Israel.
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.300]   They leave Mount Sinai and they travel up towards the promised land,
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.300]   but they find themselves camping in a place that the Bible describes as Kadesh Barnea.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.100]   And Kadesh Barnea is the next significant turning point in their story.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.100]   Now, to help you to understand all of this geography,
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.900]   let me bring back the map that I showed you right at the beginning of our series.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.100]   If you were with us some 20-something weeks ago, you would have remembered this map.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.700]   Now, back then, I actually explained to you that there are actually two ways
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.700]   of understanding Israel's journey that they took from slavery into Sinai
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.900]   and then towards the promised land.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.500]   Two routes, if you will.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.100]   What's known as the traditional route and what's known as the modern-day route.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.500]   The traditional route has Israel starting up here in the land of Goshen.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.300]   They then come down here and they cross over here where the Suez Canal is today.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.500]   By the way, this is a modern-day map, okay?
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.900]   They cross over here.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.900]   They then come down here and they stay at Mount Sinai,
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.100]   which is here around St. Catharines on the Sinai Peninsula.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.900]   And then they go from there up towards the promised land, which is up over here.
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.900]   That's the traditional route.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.100]   The modern-day route sees them up here again in Goshen.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.700]   They cross into the land of Egypt, still go down here,
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.500]   but they come over here to this place called Neuba Beach
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.300]   and they cross over the Red Sea at this point.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.500]   And then Mount Sinai is somewhere here in modern-day Saudi Arabia.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.500]   And then from there, they journey up to the promised land.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.500]   Now, which one of those you believe, well, it depends on how you read the Bible.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.300]   It depends on archaeological evidence.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.700]   If you were to ask me, I would say that actually,
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.700]   I think Mount Sinai is more likely to be here around in Saudi Arabia.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.500]   But at the end of the day, it probably doesn't really matter.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.700]   What really matters is what's the message that Exodus is trying to bring us.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.700]   And it's this message of a people of freedom trying to get towards that promised land.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.100]   Now, whether you go with the traditional route or the modern-day route,
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.500]   both are in agreement of where Israel goes next from Mount Sinai.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.300]   Whether they're starting here or whether they're starting there,
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.500]   they journey up to this place right here, which is known as Kadesh Barnea.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.300]   So this land here, if you go to the next map, guys, you'll see it on there.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.900]   Boom, there you go.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.700]   This area here, biblically, is known as Kadesh Barnea.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.300]   Now, obviously, in modern days, that has a bit of the modern-day Jordan,
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.500]   a bit of modern-day Israel.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.900]   In those days, the promised land was up here in this area.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.700]   And so they camp here, and it's here where they famously send in the spies
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.300]   to go up to the promised land to spy what's up in the promised land
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.500]   and bring a report back down to them.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   That is something that we actually talked a lot with you guys about in 2021.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.100]   If you've been a part of the Vine for a while,
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.300]   we did a whole sermon series in 2021 called "A Different Spirit,"
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.700]   where we looked at this exact story of the 12 spies going to the promised land
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.700]   and then coming back with that report.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.500]   So today, I'm not going to go into a huge amount of detail on that story.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.900]   What I want to do is take you to what that story has implications for,
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.900]   for both Israel and for us, to understand that story,
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.300]   to get an idea of what God does in the whole movement of the 12 spies
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.700]   to the promised land and returning back to Kadesh Barnea.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.200]   I actually want to take you now to modern-day Jordan,
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.600]   and I want to show you the geography of Kadesh Barnea,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.400]   because when you actually see where Israel ended up being for 40 years,
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.600]   then you'll begin to understand what God needs to say to them and to us.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.100]   Let's take a look at this.
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:03.600]   The laws of geometry teach us that the shortest distance between two points
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.800]   is actually a straight line.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.000]   But as we've seen in the Exodus narrative,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.700]   Israel's journey from their slavery in Egypt to their freedom in the promised land
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.300]   has been anything but.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.900]   I mean, much like this canyon around me right now,
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.400]   it's been a journey of a lot of twists and turns,
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.200]   where God has come and brought them on different routes and different pathways,
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.000]   and, you know, it's led them to kind of even wondering,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.200]   are they going backwards more than they're actually going forwards?
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.300]   But move forward they must.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.800]   At this point in the Exodus narrative, Israel has left Egypt,
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.600]   and they're working their way up the stark but beautiful land of modern-day Jordan,
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.700]   which is actually why I've come to Jordan today myself,
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.800]   to visit one of the seven wonders of the world
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.000]   and perhaps the most amazing archaeological site I have ever laid eyes on,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.200]   the lost city of Petra.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.400]   Known as the Rose City from the color of rocks from which it is carved,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.100]   Petra was founded by the Nabateans in the 4th century BC
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.900]   as a critical city strategically positioned
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.000]   on some of the most important trading routes at the time.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.200]   By the time of Jesus in the 1st century,
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   it had flourished to a thriving city of around about 20,000 people.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.000]   Today, only a few of the original structures remain,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.500]   but they stand testament to the wonder of both natural and human achievement,
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.000]   and they point towards the breathtaking beauty that can be found in this land.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:41.700]   Of course, Petra as a city didn't even exist at the time that Israel moved through this land,
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.900]   but it's actually just up over the mountains here where Israel did make their passage,
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.500]   and just a short hike from here, I can actually take us to a place
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.500]   where we can see something that was very critical to the Exodus journey.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.500]   Petra, the Rose City
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.000]   So I've come up here on this mountain just up out of Petra,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.500]   and it's pretty glary up here, but I've come here for a very particular purpose.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.400]   The valley right here below me is known as Wadi Arabah.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.700]   In the Exodus story, it was called Kadesh Barnea.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.200]   Now, this was the place that Israel came and settled in
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.600]   as they sent the spies out to the Promised Land,
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.500]   which is about roughly about a hundred miles northwest of here.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.500]   You know, being up here today gives me a bit of a thrill
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.500]   because I can almost imagine the Israelites settled down there,
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.000]   hundreds of thousands of them,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.700]   and their emotions would have been kind of that sense of exhaustion
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.800]   after that arduous journey that they've taken up from Egypt,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.100]   but also a sense of excitement.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.500]   You know, the Promised Land, that land flowing with milk and honey,
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.500]   it's just now almost within their reach.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   Petra, the Rose City
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:11:00.100]   So the mountain that I was just standing at near Petra is right there behind me,
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.400]   and I've just come down here now to the valley floor itself,
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.200]   and this really is incredibly hot, incredibly dry and arid,
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.400]   but standing here right now, I can see the mass expanse of land
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   that Israel had as they encamped here,
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   and I can understand why it was a great place to send out those spies
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.400]   to the Promised Land just north up here in this direction.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.900]   Now, the narrative of the spies going into the Promised Land
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.700]   is found in Numbers chapters 13 and 14.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.900]   We know the story well.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.400]   Moses sends out the twelve spies to the land,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.900]   and the twelve spies come back with a report.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.400]   And first of all, they say, "Hey, the land is exactly as God said.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.200]   It's filled with all of His promises.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.700]   It flows with milk and honey.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.700]   Here is the fruit."
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.200]   They bring some of the fruit back to show Moses and the rest of Israel.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.400]   But there's a second side of the report.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   They also say the land is filled with giants, with fortified cities, with massive armies,
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.200]   and because of that, they're filled with fear.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.900]   Right at the start of Numbers 14, they cry out with this.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:08.200]   They say, "Why have we come all this way to die right here in this desert?
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.400]   Surely it would have been better for us to have gone right back there to Egypt."
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.200]   And they actually say, "We would rather have slavery in Egypt
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.600]   than come and die in this place, in this desert."
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:26.100]   They're so filled with fear that they no longer see with faith, but they see with sight.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.100]   And that sight tells them to go backwards rather than forwards.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:41.600]   So it would be right here, like literally in this place.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.100]   That Israel would end up wandering for 40 years.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.600]   One year for every day that the spies were in the promised land
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.600]   as judgment for their fear and their lack of faith and trust.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.100]   You see, God wanted a whole generation of Israel to pass away
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.300]   before the new generation would freshly encounter God's promises.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.600]   Much like Moses, as he stood before that burning bush,
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.100]   how he was commanded to remove his sandals
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.600]   so that nothing impure would touch the holiness of God's presence.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.100]   So God now wants to remove a whole generation
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.600]   so that nothing unholy in his eyes would enter into his promises.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:24.100]   And this begins to set up for us something that is super critical about the Exodus narrative.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:30.600]   You see, our journey to freedom is a journey that God does in and through us.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   But it's not a journey where we're silent participants.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   We actually get to partner with Him in that journey.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:43.100]   God looks at us and wants us to have faith and courage and hope in His promises.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.600]   Sure, it's God that does the miracles.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   It's God that moves in power.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   But we are to trust and have faith in that work in our lives.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   I mean, this is something that Moses has faced throughout his journey.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   And it's a call that's going to come on Joshua
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   as in 40 years, he's about to take Israel into the promised land.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.100]   It's the call to be strong and courageous.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:09.600]   And it's a call that God also places on you in your journey of deliverance with Him.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   To be strong and courageous, not within yourself with your own abilities and your strengths
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.600]   and the things that you think you do well.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   But actually to find that strength and courage in a God that fights battles for you.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:27.600]   In a God who actually can do the miracles, who can move the mountains, who can remove the giants.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   And so right here in the desert of Kardesh-Banir,
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.100]   we learn something so significant for our Exodus journey.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:41.100]   That it's actually a place where we come to recognize that the strength isn't in us, it's always in God.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.100]   And so can I encourage each one of us to lean into the reality
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:51.100]   that in our Exodus, it's strength and courage that is the call upon us.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.100]   (soft music)
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:15:06.100]   In our Exodus, it is strength and courage that is the call upon us.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:13.600]   I can't think of any better phrase to begin to draw this series to a close around than that.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.600]   Because you see this journey over the last 25 weeks in the book of Exodus,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.600]   it's not a journey just so that you can understand a little bit about that book
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.100]   and maybe see a little bit about what God did for a bunch of people many, many years ago.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.600]   It's actually a story for you and a story about you.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.100]   It's a story about your next steps and how you're now to live your life.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.600]   And as we draw the series to a close, my heart for us as a community
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   is that we would now begin to live the story of Exodus out in our daily lives.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   That strength and courage would be how we live our lives.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   It's interesting as the spies went into the Promised Land,
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   they come back with this report of giants and fortified city.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   They are the two ways that they sum up the challenges that are ahead of them
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   in the Promised Land that God has for them.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   And you need to understand that there are challenges ahead for you
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   for how God wants you to live your life as a Christian.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   Challenges ahead for how you're gonna live with your family,
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   how you're gonna live with your career, how you're gonna raise your children,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   how you're gonna see your marriage flourish.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   Challenges are ahead of all of us.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.600]   The issue is not whether there are challenges ahead.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.600]   The issue is how are we gonna respond to the giants and the fortified cities
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.600]   when they come.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   And I wanna show you how Israel responds because there's something here
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.600]   that I think we need to grasp as we bring the series to a close this month.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   Let me read Numbers 14 verses 1 to 4.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   "That night all the people of the community," this is Israel,
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   "raised their voices and wept aloud.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.600]   All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron,
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.600]   and the whole assembly said to them, 'If only we had died in Egypt
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.600]   or in this desert.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   Why is the Lord bringing us to a land only to let us fall by the sword?
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   Our wives and our children will be taken as plunder.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.600]   Wouldn't it have been better for us to go back to Egypt?'
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   And they said to each other, 'May we choose a leader and go back to Egypt.'"
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   I wonder if this reminds you of anything.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   This is exactly the same thing that Israel said when their backs were
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.600]   against the Red Sea and they saw the armies of Egypt charging after them
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   and they turned to Moses and said, "Why have you led us here to die?
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.600]   We would rather go back to Egypt than go forward here because we're trapped.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   We don't think there's any way to go."
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   And now so many years later, as God has done so much in them,
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.600]   they're still saying the same thing.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   Haven't you seen the giants?
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   Haven't you seen the fortified cities?
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.600]   Don't you see all the obstacles that are ahead of us?
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.600]   It would have been better for us to remain in our slavery.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.600]   At least we understood it. At least it was known to us.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.600]   Yes, we were suffering, but it was a suffering we had become comfortable with.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   We're not comfortable with the uncertainty of a future.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.600]   We'd rather take the comfort of slavery.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   It's amazing what fear does to us.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:07.600]   Fear will always cause you to choose decisions designed for your comfort
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   rather than decisions that are designed for your freedom.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.600]   Oh, come on church.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   Fear will always cause you to make decisions designed for your comfort,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   not necessarily decisions that are designed for your freedom.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   Israel would rather hold on to what was known and comfortable to them,
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.600]   even if that meant slavery,
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   than move forward to what was unknown and uncomfortable for them,
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   even though that was their freedom.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:39.600]   And you have not been saved by Jesus for a safe, comfortable, easy life.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.600]   If you carry the name of Christ with you,
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.600]   if you say you are a Christian,
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.600]   that means that you are the bravest, most boldest, most courageous person that there is.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   It means that God has saved you for a mission and a purpose.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.600]   And that mission and the purpose is to reveal his heart of justice,
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   his heart of love, his heart of grace in this world,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   and Paul writing to the church to help them to soberly understand this call,
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   would say to them, "If anybody is in Christ Jesus, they will be persecuted."
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   And he says it with a smile.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   He says, "It's going to be hard. It's going to be tough.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.600]   There's going to be giants and fortified cities,
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.600]   and the call is to be strong and courageous,
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.600]   because if you're strong and courageous, you'll face the giants,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.600]   you'll face the fortified cities,
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   and we'll see this thing called my kingdom move forward.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.600]   But if you're weak, and if you hold off of those things,
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.600]   and if you would rather have comfort and safety,
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   well, you can have comfort and safety without me," God says.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   "But if you want me, then strap yourself in for adventure,
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   because what I need my church to be doing is to be my hands and feet in this world."
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   It's going to take strength and courage for you to live as God has called you to live.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.600]   And one of the things we have to ask ourselves is when we get too comfortable and too easy,
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   we have to ask ourselves whether we are still living out of the missional purposes
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.600]   that God has for us, or whether we've decided to stay in Kadesh-Baniya
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   rather than move forward to the promised land.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   It's interesting, in Kadesh-Baniya, there were no giants or fortified cities.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.600]   And you saw it in the film, there was nothing there.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.600]   And when nothing's there, it's easy.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   It's dry, it's barren, it's hot, but at least there's no giants or fortified cities.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   The giants and fortified cities were in the place of God's promises,
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   and that was where He needed His people to be.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   And it was going to take strength and courage for them to move forward in that way.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   And you need to understand that that's the life that God has called you to do.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.600]   It will take strength and courage for you to fight for the gospel.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.600]   It will take strength and courage for you to fight for the gospel.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   You're going to have to fight against the giants of a mind and the fortified cities of a heart.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.600]   If you want to stand for justice in this world, it's going to take you courage
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.600]   to fight against the giants that are found in corridors of power
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.600]   and the fortified cities that are found in systemic injustice and abuse.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.600]   If you truly want to stand for the poor and the vulnerable and the marginalized in a community,
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   it's going to take courage for you to stand against the giants
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.600]   that are found in our selfish decision-making
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.600]   and the fortified cities of our bank accounts and resources.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   See, to live the Christian life is the greatest adventure you'll ever live,
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.600]   but it is not for the weak-hearted.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:30.600]   And when Christ invites us into this life, he invites us in with this challenge.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.600]   Kadesh Barnea or the Promised Land?
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   I don't know about you, but I know Kadesh Barnea really well.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   A number of years ago, I was working in investment banking,
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.600]   and I traveled quite a lot to our Tokyo office at the time.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.600]   And on one of my trips up there, I was having coffee with one of my colleagues
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   in the department I was working in, and she was sharing with me
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.600]   about how she felt she was passed over for promotion because of her gender.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.600]   And I was having a coffee with her and listening to her share that because she was a woman,
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   she felt like she didn't get the same promotional opportunities in the bank.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   She felt like there was a culture that was patriarchal,
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   a culture that was against the promotion of women.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.600]   I had a lot of sympathy for her.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.600]   I actually felt her heart, and I knew that probably what she was saying was true.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   And she was sharing this with me because I actually was really good friends with her boss,
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.600]   her direct boss, and she was hoping that I might be able to, over a beer or something,
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   have a chat with her boss and maybe help him to understand that this is how some of the women
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.600]   in her department or in his department were acting,
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.600]   and that perhaps there is a little bit of a culture that we have at the bank
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.600]   that needs to be addressed.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   And I realized in that moment that the courageous decision would have been
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.600]   to have that conversation with the boss.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.600]   The courageous decision would have been to go and say, "Hey, I'm a man myself,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   and I understand that there is this culture. I've benefited from that culture myself."
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   I realized that I've probably been promoted when maybe some other women in my department
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.600]   should have been promoted.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   I realized that all the senior leadership in our firm are men,
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.600]   and maybe that diversity is not right.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.600]   I should have had the courage to sit down with him and say that there are some people
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.600]   being overlooked simply because they are not the same gender as the ones that are in power.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   The weak response, though, the weak response was to listen to her and tell her
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   that I cared for her and heard her, and yet not had that conversation with the boss
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.600]   because I realized in having that conversation with the boss,
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   my own career would be put in jeopardy.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.600]   That maybe if I had that conversation, I wouldn't be able to be as promoted as I had been.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   That actually, as a man, I kind of enjoyed the reality of the culture that was in the firm.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.600]   I thought I was the one who benefited from it, and I didn't want to put that at jeopardy.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:52.600]   I'd like to stand before you and tell you that I was courageous, but I was weak,
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.600]   and I never had that conversation.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   And out of all the 10 years that I was in the business world,
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.600]   that's the one decision that I regret the most,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.600]   that I never stood up for the person that asked me to stand up for them
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   in a culture that needed standing up against.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.600]   After that, I carried some guilt and shame around with me for quite a while,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.600]   and I experienced Kadesh Banir.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:21.600]   I experienced what it was like to stay comfortable, but in a dryness of the soul.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   And I think I left my colleague in her Kadesh Banir as well,
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.600]   where she had longed for something more in the company she was working for,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.600]   and because I was not strong enough to stand up for her,
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.600]   she probably remained where she did for longer than she should have.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   I think we all know Kadesh Banir well in our lives.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   And the question I have to ask myself is, how do I do better?
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   Or maybe the question we need to ask ourselves is, how do we do better?
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.600]   How do we live more Christ-like in our city?
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.600]   How do we have the strength and courage to have the conversations
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.600]   and stand up for the vulnerable and the marginalized more in our city?
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:05.600]   How do we find the courage to do the thing that so often we lack in ourselves?
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   There are two spies, of course, in the story that have that courage in them.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.600]   They're the ones that hold the different spirit.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   And I want you to see how they respond to the fear that is amongst their people.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.600]   This is starting in verse 6 of Numbers 14.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.600]   "Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh,
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.600]   and said to the entire Israelite assembly,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.600]   'The land we pass through is exceedingly good.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   If the Lord is pleased with us, He will lead us into that land,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   Only do not rebel against the Lord.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.600]   Do not be afraid of the people of that land, because we will swallow them up.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.600]   Their protection is gone, but the Lord is with us.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   Do not be afraid of them.'"
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.600]   There's something in Joshua and Caleb that enables them to stand
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   against the majority opinion around them,
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.600]   against the culture of their day, if you will,
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.600]   and say, "We're not going to remain in Kadesh-Benir."
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.600]   That if we believe that God is with us, if we believe that He is for us,
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.600]   then we will go up and take this land, because He's promised us this land.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.600]   There's something in them that I know that so often is not in me.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.600]   I want you to see how Joshua and Caleb try to bring courage and strength to their people.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.600]   The first thing they say is, "If the Lord is pleased with us."
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   I want you to think about this phrase,
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   because I think this means so much to every single one of us here.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.600]   "If the Lord is pleased with us," which really what Joshua and Caleb are saying is,
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   if we believe that God is for us, then we have nothing to fear.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.600]   If we really believe that God stands with us,
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.600]   then we know that we can go to whatever obstacles,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.600]   whatever giants, and whatever fortified cities might be there.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   It doesn't mean we're always going to be successful.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   It doesn't mean that everything we put our hands to is suddenly going to be amazing.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   But it does mean that we have one who has promised us something,
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   and one who's going to fight on our behalf.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   It means that we can find the strength and courage in us
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.600]   to face the giants and the fortified cities,
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.600]   to say that Kadesh-Benir is not where we're going to live,
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.600]   if the Lord is pleased with us.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   And here's the reality for all of us.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   We so often make weak and bad decisions in our lives
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   because we ultimately think that God isn't pleased with us.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:27.600]   See, when you think that God is not really that pleased with you,
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.600]   you're always going to choose self-preservation in your life.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   You're always going to choose a path that takes you towards comfort and security
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   rather than the future that God has for you.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:49.600]   And we think so often that God is not pleased with us because of our sin.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   Some of us in this room, you know you're in a season where you're struggling with some sin.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.600]   And you're not proud of what it is that you're doing,
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.600]   and you're struggling to get free from it.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.600]   And because of that, your perception is you think that God is not pleased with you.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   How could God be happy with you, with the life that you're leading?
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   And because you're leading that life, you think God has given up on you.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.600]   You think he's distant from you. You think he's angry at you.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   And all of that causes you to make more and more weak decisions
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   towards the sin rather than the freedom.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.600]   And what we have to understand is in the Old Testament,
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   when they said, "If the Lord is pleased with us,"
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   they're trying to work out whether God is actually pleased with them or not.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.600]   But we're not people of the Old Testament.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.600]   We're people of the New Testament.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.600]   We're people of Jesus.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   We're people of the ones who live now under a new covenant.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   We're people who now live under one who has stood in the gap
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   and taken all of our sin and brokenness on his shoulders.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   In the Old Testament, they were going, "Is God going to really be pleased with us?"
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   And we've got to uphold all this law to make sure we get God on our side.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   In the New Testament, we live now in a time where we know that Christ is for us.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.600]   We know that he stood in the gap and paid the price for our sin,
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   so we have this freedom.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:09.600]   Our question shouldn't be, "Is God pleased with us?"
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.600]   Our question should be, "Because God has chosen to be pleased with us,
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   how can I now make decisions in my life that honor the pleasure of Christ in me?"
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.600]   Let me put it this way.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   It's actually not about whether God is pleased with you or not.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   It's actually about whether he's pleased with Christ,
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   and he is pleased with Christ.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   And because he's pleased with Jesus, he is pleased with you.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   Because even in your sin, he still went to the cross for you.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   Even in the ongoing sin that you struggle with, he has not removed his love from you.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   Even in the challenges that we have, his grace is still present with us.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:58.600]   Make no mistake, God hates sin, and that sin is judged by God.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   So we don't have the excuse because of Jesus to go on sinning and not care.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   We have the call under Christ to continue to submit our brokenness to him,
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   ask for his forgiveness, and walk in the power of that forgiveness.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   But our reality is we have strength and courage in us
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   because we should never guess whether God is pleased with us or not.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   He is pleased with me because of the blood of Jesus.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.600]   He is pleased with me because I've been made a child, an heir of his.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.600]   He is my high priest who stands in the gap and speaks before the Father
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   and says, "This one, Andrew, is not perfect, but see him through the blood of Jesus."
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.600]   And when you see him through the blood of Jesus, he's forgiven, he's saved,
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.600]   he is filled, and he is released.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.600]   Where does my strength and courage come?
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   Does it come because I think I'm good? No.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:51.600]   Does it come because even in my brokenness he reigns? Yes.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   If you truly believe that God is pleased with you,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.600]   you will face giants and fortified cities.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.600]   Are you with me, church?
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.600]   But there's another bit here.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.600]   There's another bit that's even more important.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   It's a bit that Caleb and Joshua speak to that I think the church is uniquely gifted for
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   more than any other institution in the world.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   And to help you to understand this process that Joshua and Caleb speak to in this passage,
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.600]   I want to actually take you back to Egypt, to Cairo, actually,
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.600]   for the very final time in this whole series.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.600]   And I want to take you to a place where people make paper.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.600]   I know. Stay with me for a second.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   The greatest way that you're going to find strength and courage
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.600]   doesn't just come from your relationship with God and the fact that He's pleased with you
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.600]   despite the realities of your brokenness and sin.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.600]   The place where you'll find your greatest strength and courage will come
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.600]   when you understand how paper was originally made.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   And so when I went to Egypt, I got taught how to make original paper,
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   and I want to show you that experience. Let's have a look at this.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.600]   [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   - We're here today at the Golden Eagle, a papyrus shop right in the heart of Cairo,
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.600]   and I'm here with Asma, and today she's going to be teaching me
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.600]   how to actually make papyrus paper, which is something that's been done
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   for thousands of years. I'm so grateful to be here. Thanks for hosting us.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.600]   - Oh, my name is Asma, and I'm going to explain to you everything about this plant
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   and how the ancient Egyptian people made the first paper out of this plant.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.600]   This is the papyrus plant. It's an aquatic and a tropical plant
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   because it needs a lot of water and high temperature to grow.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   That's why it grows beside to the banks of the Nile River.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   And it's also a holy plant for the ancient Egyptians for two reasons.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.600]   The first reason, the flower looks like the sun rays, which is a symbol of Amun-Ra,
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.600]   the god of sun for the ancient Egyptians.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.600]   The second reason, the stem has a triangle shape.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.600]   - Yeah, that looks like a pyramid. - Yeah, which is a symbol of eternity.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   - That's great. - So make a paper like this one.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   We cut the stem according to the size that we want.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.600]   Now I'm going to remove the green cover.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.600]   The green cover nowadays is useless, but in ancient times, they used this part
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.600]   to make hats, mats, wood baskets, wood sandals, even the small boots.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.600]   I would probably chop my finger off if I tried to do that.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.600]   You're very skilled at that.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   We use this part to make the paper, but this part is very weak and so easily broken.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.600]   - Right. - It's like sugar cane, but we don't eat it.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   - Right. - Now I'm going to use the hammer.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.600]   - I'm moving all the water out like that. - OK, I'm going to try.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   - It flattens very quickly. - Yeah.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   - And here. Do you see the water? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.600]   - And after that, we use the ruler pen. - OK.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.600]   To make it flexible. Do like you do pizza.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   - It's like bread or pizza, right? - Yeah.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.600]   OK. And this is just to get the water out and to make it as dry as possible?
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.600]   - Flexibly. - Flexible, right.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   - OK, it's enough. - OK.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.600]   OK. Now there's no water inside it. It's more flexible and strong than before.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.600]   - Can I feel? - Oh, yeah.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.600]   - It's sticky, right? - Yeah, it's kind of like sticky.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   After that, we soak it into the water to reduce the amount of the sugar.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   Six days to get this paper.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   - After that, between two sheets of carpet... - Right.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   I'm going to take the slices and put them in one vertical and horizontal line.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.600]   - Would you do that? - Sure.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   - So put this vertical? - Yeah.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.600]   - OK. - And one in horizontal.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   - And you put, like, one on top of it like that? - Yeah.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   - So it's kind of like a crisscross pattern? - Yeah.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   - OK. - After finishing all the paper, we cover it.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.600]   Like this one. And put it under the press machine.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   OK, so cover it and then put it under here.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.600]   And put it under the press machine for another six days.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   - Six days? - Yeah.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   Oh, my goodness. OK. Can I just put this in now?
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   - How tight? Really tight? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.600]   But in ancient times, they didn't have that machine, so they used...
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.600]   What did they use? Guess what.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   - Uh, maybe stones? - Yes, maybe stones.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.600]   OK, we have here six days in the fresh water and six days under the press machine.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.600]   After 12 days, we will have the first paper in the history.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.600]   OK.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:24.600]   - Ah! - The papyrus paper.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.600]   - Wow. - It's strong and flexible.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.600]   So when it's just, like, one strand on its own, it's actually, like, really weak.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   But when you kind of create them and pack them all together
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.600]   and press them and dry them out, it actually becomes really strong.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   Yes, this is because of the amount of the sugar inside.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   Right. So the more the sugar there is,
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   the more you cross it around and press it together, the stronger it'll be.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   Yes, and wait until it's dry, and we can use it easily.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   And can you tear it?
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.600]   If I do that, I can cut it into slices.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:36:01.600]   We will see the vertical and horizontal lines, right?
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.600]   Mm-hm.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.600]   And I can put a little water here to fix it again.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.600]   - And one day under the press machine... - You can fix it again?
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   Yeah. One day under the press machine, and we can use it again.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.600]   - So go back. - OK, OK.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.600]   I just need to get my head around that one.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   OK, so you can tear it up and kind of screw up the paper.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   - Yeah. - But as long as you put the individual crisscrossing again,
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   putting them all back together again, pressing it again, it'll be strong again.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   - Yes. - That is super paper.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   - Yeah. Super paper. - It is super paper. That's amazing.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   Hey, well, thanks so much.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   I mean, I think that's helped us to really understand
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.600]   how something that on the surface appears very weak,
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.600]   just a little plant like that,
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.600]   can really, through that process, become so strong as it works together
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   with that, with the crisscrossing and the sugar.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.600]   That's been amazing. Thank you so much for taking time to show us this.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   - It's been incredible. - Oh, nice to meet you.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   Nice to meet you, too.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:03.600]   Asma is the fastest-speaking Egyptian I have ever met in my life.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.600]   [laughter]
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   I had no idea what she said the whole time.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   [laughter]
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.600]   I hope she's not watching. Bless you, Asma.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.600]   Let me show you what Caleb and Joshua say here
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   and link this to what you've just seen.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.600]   Verse 9, "Only do not rebel against the Lord,
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.600]   and do not be afraid of the people of the land,
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   because He will swallow them up. Their protection is gone,
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.600]   but the Lord is with us."
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.600]   Do not be afraid of them. I love what he says here.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.600]   He says, "The Lord is with us."
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.600]   First of all, he says, "The Lord is with us."
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.600]   That's a good thing, because if it's just us, it's bad.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.600]   "The Lord is with us."
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.600]   But then he says, "The Lord is with us."
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.600]   He doesn't say, "The Lord is with Moses."
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.600]   He doesn't say, "The Lord is with the good people."
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.600]   He doesn't say, "The Lord is with just those who come to church every Sunday."
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.600]   He said, "The Lord is with us."
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   He's with all of us, in all of our brokenness,
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.600]   in all of our weakness, in all of our strength,
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.600]   in our giftings, in all of our bad mistakes.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   He's with all of that.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.600]   And because He is interwoven with us,
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.600]   we now are strengthened in Him.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.600]   And I love this picture of the papyrus paper.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   This is a piece that they gave us from the shop.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.600]   I don't know if you can see this in the light at all.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.600]   Maybe if I turn to the side, you might be able to see the crisscross pattern.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   Can you see that in there?
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   Yeah, the crisscross pattern in there.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.600]   That's a beautiful picture of what church is all about.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   Because on your own, you are pretty weak and vulnerable.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.600]   But when we come together in the body of Christ,
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   and we realize that on our own,
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.600]   we may not be able to make all the decisions that would bring glory to Jesus.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.600]   But when we work together,
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   when we realize that we are cross in our lives and in our destinies together,
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   when we realize that we need the water added to us like that paper needed,
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.600]   the Holy Spirit given to a bunch of believers,
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.600]   when we realize that at times God presses us,
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.600]   brings us into persecution,
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.600]   brings us into hard times to press us together
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   and to bond our unity even more together as we face the challenges in life.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   As we realize that, we realize we become as a community,
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   both strong like this and incredibly flexible
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   so that we can do the things that Christ has called us to do in the world.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   You want to know where your strength and courage comes?
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   It comes, yes, from a God who is pleased with us
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   and knowing that He's pleased with us,
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.600]   but it also comes in knowing that we have one another.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   It comes knowing that we're not saved for an individual relationship with God
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.600]   and to be on our own in the world.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   We're saved so that we can be together as the body of Christ,
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.600]   the body of Christ.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:54.600]   For the Lord is with us in all of our brokenness.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   He is with us in all of our strength.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   He is with us in all of our frailty.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   He is with us in all of the things that we're anointed to do by His Spirit.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.600]   He is with us in all of it.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   And as we commit to one another,
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   we grow and strengthen, not just ourselves, but us as a community.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   I love it when she took the knife and she went and cut the piece of paper
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   and started to pull the strands out.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.600]   And if we're honest with ourselves as the body of Christ, as the church,
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   there have been many times in church history over the last 2,000 years
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.600]   where it feels like a knife has been brought to the church
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   and been torn apart.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.600]   I would say even during our protest time here in Hong Kong,
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.600]   the church was torn apart at times, during COVID even.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   And your perspectives on that issue
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   and whether you should get the vaccine or not and all of that
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   had the challenge of tearing apart the unity of the church.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   But I love the fact that with papyrus paper,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.600]   even if it's been torn apart a little bit,
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.600]   it just needs to get crisscrossed a bit.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.600]   You need to add a little bit more water to it.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.600]   You need to press down a little bit.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.600]   And then, hey, presto, it's back together again.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:06.600]   And isn't it great that no matter how battered the church gets,
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.600]   as the Holy Spirit falls upon us and brings us together again,
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   we are reunited in that one prayer that Jesus has.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.600]   "My prayer for them, Lord, is that they would be united as one,
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.600]   like you and I are united as one."
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.600]   Your strength and courage comes, yes, from how God is pleased with you,
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.600]   but it also comes from the person sitting next to you,
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   from what it is to be called to be community.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   And if you came in today feeling isolated and alone,
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.600]   you're a part of the body of Christ here at The Vine.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.600]   And that should mean something.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.600]   It should mean something to us and it should mean something to you.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.600]   And when we share our stories and our vulnerabilities,
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.600]   when we ask for prayer and we recognize our weaknesses,
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.600]   when we know what the giants and the fortified cities are in our lives
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.600]   and we ask each other to come together,
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.600]   we as a church move from Kadesh Barnea to the promised land that God has for it.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.600]   Whatever that might mean for The Church of Jesus Christ here in Hong Kong,
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:03.600]   you are not alone and you have been saved for the most courageous life.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.600]   You have not been saved for comfortable, easy decisions.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:12.600]   You've been saved for justice and goodness and love and mercy and grace.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.600]   And those things will require a strength of courage in you to walk forward.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.600]   Find that strength in a God who is pleased with you,
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.600]   no matter what it might be that's going on in your life.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   And find that strength in the community of the brothers and sisters around you
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   who even in their weaknesses, as broken jars of clay,
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.600]   enable the gospel to still continue to be seen.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   That is how the Exodus story draws to its end.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.600]   And that should inspire us and fill us with great hope. Amen?
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.600]   Can I pray for us? Let's pray.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:50.600]   Father, we are so incredibly grateful
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   that you have called us to be strong and courageous in our lives.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.600]   And Father, like I shared today, we know Kadesh Barnea well.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.600]   We know what it is to make decisions that keep us in the dry and weary place,
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.600]   the isolated place that we become comfortable with.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   It takes courage to face the giants and the fortified cities,
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   to live a life that you truly called us to live.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   And Father, as we see in the papyrus paper,
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   you have brought us together not to live that life alone.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   And Lord, we're thankful for our brothers and sisters in this room,
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:31.600]   the people around us. We are your children.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   And Father, I want to pray that you would draw us together in a deeper way
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.600]   as we draw our series to a close in the next week.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.600]   That Father, you would continue to fill us with your spirit,
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.600]   the water that binds us together.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.600]   That we would recognize that in those moments where we are pressed,
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   we are not crushed.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:58.600]   That actually the pressing draws us into a deeper place of unity than ever before.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.600]   Father, I want to pray that our strength and courage is found in you
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   and is found in our fellowship together.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:14.600]   I want to encourage you in response today to invite some prayer for you.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   Perhaps there are some things that are going on for you
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.600]   where you would just love and value someone to pray for you.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.600]   And so we're gonna take some time as the worship team
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.600]   just play gently in the background.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:29.600]   I'm gonna invite you into a space to just pray for one another.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   Maybe you came in here with some people, some friends, some family.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.600]   I want to encourage you to take some time just to maybe share some of the giants
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.600]   or the fortified cities that are in front of you in this moment.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.600]   And just invite the person next to you to pray for you.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.600]   If you came here on your own, this is a great way.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.600]   I know it's a little bit uncomfortable.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.600]   But you are a part of the body of Christ.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:54.600]   And so you can reach out to the person sitting next to you, introduce yourself
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.600]   and say, "Hey, I'd love some prayer for this.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   There's this going on in my life. I can't do this alone.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   I would love someone to just encourage me and support me today."
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.600]   So I want to invite you to do that.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.600]   That means you need to open your eyes.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.600]   It means that you need to look at the person next to you and smile at them
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:16.600]   and say, "Hi, nice to meet you. I would like some prayer today.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.600]   Could you pray for this for me?"
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   And then they're going to pray for you.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   And then you can pray for them.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.600]   And then in a moment, we'll be closing our service together.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   So let's spend some time in prayer together.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   together.
