[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Can we give our worship team a great thank you.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.840]   So good to see you guys and welcome to the Vine
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.960]   if this is your first time, have a seat.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.440]   We're glad that you are with us.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.760]   Welcome Upper House.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.740]   I'll be here all week.
[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.720]   Welcome everybody online.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.420]   We're so glad that you guys are tuning in as well.
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.240]   We know that people are tuning in from all over the world.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.440]   You might be in Hong Kong right now.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.900]   You might be somewhere else.
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.520]   We're so glad that you're watching this weather live
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.120]   with us in this moment or catching up
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.340]   at a time that's convenient for you.
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.520]   We pray and believe that through technology,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.960]   God moves just as much and just as powerfully
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.120]   as if you were in this room.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.660]   So we are grateful for you.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.480]   Thanks for tuning in today and for each one of you.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.560]   Who's been here for most of the series
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.240]   for the different spirit series?
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.680]   Let's have a look at your hands.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.520]   Most of you.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.940]   All right, that's the majority of people here.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.780]   That's wonderful.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.000]   That's great.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.040]   We're finishing that series today.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.880]   And I wanna speak to you about your courage
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.240]   and your strength.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.760]   I actually believe that the number one thing
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.160]   that the Holy Spirit wants us to finish this series with
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.280]   as a way of launching us into the next thing
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.440]   is by reminding you about your source
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.840]   and your need for courage and strength.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.600]   So let me start by sharing with you
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.720]   something out of my own life.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.660]   I have a phobia.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.840]   It's actually a clinically defined phobia.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840]   My phobia is that I'm afraid of the ocean.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.360]   It's pretty sad.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.400]   I've struggled with this fear for the majority of my life.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.640]   I don't mind, to be honest,
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.200]   being on a boat floating on the ocean.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.600]   I don't mind maybe like walking on a beach,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.680]   putting my toes a little bit in the water of an ocean.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.000]   But the idea of swimming in an ocean
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.960]   fills me with absolute terror.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.060]   Now, I'm not exactly sure how this started,
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.880]   but it might've been at the moment
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.480]   when at the age of eight years old,
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.160]   my parents allowed me to watch the film "Jaws."
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.640]   Anyone else seen "Jaws" here?
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.200]   Do not let your children watch "Jaws."
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.720]   I was eight years old
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.440]   and I spent the whole movie with my two pillows
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.280]   in front of my eyes,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.920]   but I couldn't stop looking away
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.760]   from this ferocious water-based mammal of a shark
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.600]   eating everything in its path.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.400]   By the way, I also have a minor phobia to cello music.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.880]   And the whole time I was filled with such dread, such fear,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.960]   and that impacted my whole childhood up to this day.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.460]   Now, when you grow up in Hong Kong,
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.640]   being afraid of the ocean is a bit of a problem.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.320]   There's over 200 islands that make up Hong Kong.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.420]   And when you're young here,
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.280]   I spent the majority of my weekends
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.440]   hanging out with friends on junks or whatever it might be,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.200]   and they'd all be jumping off the top of the boat,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.280]   they'd all be swimming around,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.280]   and I'd be the nerd in the rowing boat,
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.520]   rowing next to them, afraid to get in the ocean.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.820]   This was my childhood, seriously.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.320]   At the age of 14,
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.320]   my parents decided that the best way
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.460]   to spend a family holiday
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.880]   would be at a beach resort in the Seychelles
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.540]   in the middle of nowhere,
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.000]   a small little island surrounded by water.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.240]   So we went there,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.940]   and I remember going into the lobby of this hotel,
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.500]   and right there on a big board,
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.980]   as you came in the lobby, was a sign.
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.980]   It said, "Sign up for your one-day scuba diving experience."
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.260]   And I thought to myself,
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.800]   maybe this is the way to overcome my fear.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.340]   Maybe if I could just get the courage in me
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.980]   to sign up for this one-day scuba diving experience,
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.420]   then I would go out into the ocean,
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.900]   I would see that the ocean is filled
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.540]   with all these beautiful things,
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.780]   that it's perfectly safe,
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.700]   and this would set me free from my fear.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.620]   So I said to my mom and dad,
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.900]   "Can I sign up for the one-day scuba diving?"
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.180]   They said, "Are you mad?
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.460]   "You're phobic of the ocean."
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.540]   I said, "Yes, this is psychology.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.040]   "It's called flooding.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.380]   "You flood yourself with your terror,
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.140]   "and you realize that it's not that bad,
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.280]   "and you overcome it."
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.080]   My mom was like, "Where do I sign?"
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.660]   They signed me up for my one-day scuba diving experience.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.500]   Now, this experience existed in this way.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.340]   You had a one-hour classroom of lectures.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.700]   You then, for about two and a half hours,
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.580]   were gonna scuba dive
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.820]   in the bottom of the swimming pool of the resort.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.740]   And then after you've done that, after lunch,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.380]   you would go out on the boat,
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.060]   and they would take you out about 200 yards offshore.
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.900]   They would drop the anchor rope,
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.420]   and what you would do is you would swim down the anchor rope
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.000]   into about 30 meters of water,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.700]   swim around for about 20 minutes,
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.060]   back up the anchor rope,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.580]   and that was your one-day scuba diving experience.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.940]   The one-hour of classroom lectures
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.140]   consisted of this as a summary.
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.700]   "When you're in the water,
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.400]   "do not have a moment of uncertainty."
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.520]   This was all that I was planning to do in the water,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.680]   was to have lots and lots and lots of moments of uncertainty.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.260]   We then went into the swimming pool,
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.820]   and I discovered in the swimming pool
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.780]   that I was actually a really good,
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.180]   skills-based scuba diver.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.820]   I could take off my mask,
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.740]   put it back on again, and get all the water out.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.460]   I could take my regulator out and sort of swim around a bit
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.700]   and then put the regulator back in,
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.940]   and I could do all the safety drills that were needed.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.600]   My skills as a scuba diver were good.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.700]   We then had lunch, which consisted of food
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.740]   that I do not remember because I did not eat any of it.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.540]   I was so nervous, my stomach was going in knots,
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.820]   I couldn't handle it.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.280]   Right after lunch, we stepped down onto the beach
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.220]   with all of our scuba gear.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.060]   And I'm standing there, there's the boat,
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.740]   and there's this massive ocean in front of me.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.740]   And I'm thinking to myself,
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.080]   this is the worst decision I have ever made.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.180]   And I literally pray, and I say,
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.740]   Jesus, if you are Jesus,
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.920]   I need some courage to step on this boat.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.820]   Somehow, I got myself on the boat.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.680]   As we start to go out from the shore,
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.880]   they pair us up with a dive buddy,
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.340]   something very important.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.740]   I was paired up with a Frenchman
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.660]   who was probably about 26, 27 years old.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.220]   I'm an English person who's 14.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.500]   He seemed very old and scary to me.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.140]   And as he's sitting next to me,
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.020]   he doesn't speak a lot of English.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.560]   I don't speak much French,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   but he can tell by looking in my eyes, I am terrified.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.940]   And so he's staring at me,
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.780]   and I can see that that's making him a little bit,
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.980]   like, this is my dive buddy, right?
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.980]   He goes, (speaking in French)
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.860]   Was that all right?
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.680]   Was that French?
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.520]   Yeah, all right, okay.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.100]   I don't know what that is in French, but anyway.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.420]   And I was like, okay, all right, all right.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.180]   We get out about 200 yards.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.660]   They let the anchor rope down.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.980]   Everybody starts jumping in the water
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.540]   like this is the best day of their lives.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.980]   My French buddy gets in the water
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.220]   and he starts to drift out towards the anchor rope.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.860]   I realized that if I don't go now,
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.420]   I'm going to leave him to the terrors of the ocean.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.860]   Somehow I get in the water,
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.420]   I drift over to the anchor rope,
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.100]   and my French friend, he gives me a French thumbs up.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.620]   I don't know what that is, but it was like, voila.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.140]   (speaking in French)
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.620]   He starts to go down the anchor rope, right?
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.260]   And I'm like, if I don't go now, I'll lose him.
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.740]   I might lose my way.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.740]   So mustering all the courage I could find,
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.060]   I start to let the air out
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.580]   and I start to descend down at the anchor rope.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.540]   I get five meters down
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.140]   and I see a movement on my right-hand side.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.740]   Now, when you're scuba diving,
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.500]   you can't just go, oh, what's that?
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.540]   So I'm there like.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.380]   And a shark swims past me on my right-hand side,
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.940]   swims down towards the other scuba divers
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.260]   and slowly drifts off into the horizon.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.220]   A shark.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:17.700]   I've been in the water less than five minutes.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.780]   I haven't been in the water since I was eight years old.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.540]   This classifies as a moment of uncertainty.
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.380]   Now, what a brave person would have done
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.420]   was to swim down, grab my French buddy,
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.140]   tell him, "Shark," you know,
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.140]   get him up out of the water and into freedom and safety.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.020]   Sorry, but I let my French guy go.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.420]   I was so overwhelmed.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.020]   I swam as quickly as I could to the surface.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.580]   Luckily, I was only about five meters down,
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.660]   so there wasn't any worries.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.860]   I got right to the surface.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.540]   I was panicking.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.500]   I swam as fast as I could back over to the boat.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.780]   The Seychelles boat boy, he grabs me by my arms.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.900]   He yanks me up and he pulls me onto my back on the boat.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.700]   And I rip off my mask and I rip out my regulator
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.220]   and I'm about to go, "Shark, shark!"
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.980]   And he leans over me and he goes,
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.300]   "Hey, man, did you see the dolphin?"
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:19.700]   Dolphin?
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.420]   "Hey, man, did you see the dolphin?"
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.540]   I don't know why he's Irish.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.900]   He just sounded Irish then.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.700]   I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.540]   "I saw the dolphin.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.860]   "Did you see the, I wanted to come back
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.900]   "to make sure you saw the dolphin.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.100]   "Did you see the dolphin?"
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.940]   I think it's quite interesting how we humans
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.260]   have a tendency to turn dolphins into sharks in our lives.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:52.180]   We just spent seven weeks looking at a story of Israel
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.500]   who, because of fear, turned a dolphin into a shark.
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.580]   God had given them this amazing promised land,
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.140]   this place for them to go and inhabit
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.100]   and to conquer and to take,
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.620]   that he had literally rolled out the red carpet for them,
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.020]   a place filling with milk and honey,
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.980]   grapes that looked of the promises of God.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.220]   And they were so afraid of the giants in the land
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.180]   that they came back, those 10 spies,
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.860]   with a report that stirred up such fear in the camp
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.420]   that they felt like they were going to be devoured
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.980]   by the shark in that place.
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.740]   I mean, it blows my mind that in my fear,
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.580]   God thought the best thing for me,
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.980]   let me help Andrew overcome his fear.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.980]   I will send him, literally rolling out the red carpet
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.540]   of aquaness, I will send him a dolphin.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.940]   Peace-loving, beautiful, (imitates dolphin)
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.780]   dolphin.
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.100]   And in my fear, I turned dolphins into sharks
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.300]   and we see that Israel suffers in the same way.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.020]   And for 40 years, note this, 40 years,
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.340]   that fear has an impact on their lives.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.820]   For 40 years, they have to wait for a whole generation
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.940]   to be released from Israel.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.580]   A whole generation that doubted God,
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.580]   rebelled against him because of the fear,
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.460]   decided that that wasn't the way it was,
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.220]   turned that dolphin into a shark, 40 years,
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.580]   that God purges that out of them.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.500]   And at the end of that 40 years,
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.500]   Moses is still alive somehow, really old now.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.220]   And he realizes that he's about to die.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.420]   And in the moment of understanding
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.220]   that death is right near him,
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.380]   the Holy Spirit leads him up a mountain,
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.740]   a little bit like how the Holy Spirit led him up a mountain
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.820]   of Mount Sinai to receive the law.
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.420]   This time, leads him up a mountain called Mount Nebo.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.500]   Mount Nebo is in modern day Jordan.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.460]   And from this mountain, you can look out
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.020]   and you can see the promised land.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.860]   In fact, I had the great privilege
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.980]   of traveling to Jordan just two years ago,
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.980]   and I was able to stand right where Moses stood,
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.460]   looking out on the same geographical view
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.500]   that he would have seen.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.660]   And I took a photo, I want you to see this.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.020]   This is what it looks like.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.180]   So Moses is standing there and he's looking out
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.220]   and you see all the green that is there.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.300]   That's the fertile land, that's Canaan for Moses,
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.180]   modern day Israel for us.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.580]   And you can see maybe just,
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.460]   if you look at the middle of the screen,
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.380]   just a little bit to the right,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.020]   there's a bit of blue dot there.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.180]   That's the Sea of Galilee.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.740]   I mean, you can see all of the incredibleness
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.860]   of the Holy Land right there from Mount Nebo.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.380]   And Moses would have looked over there
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.540]   and would have realized,
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.900]   I am not going to go into that place.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:38.060]   And instead, the Spirit speaks to him
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.420]   and he decides that he's going to anoint
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.420]   and appoint Joshua to go
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.780]   and be the one that would lead Israel into the land.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.180]   Joshua, one of the two spies
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.100]   that didn't turn the dolphin into a shark.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.740]   One of the two that went into the land,
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.260]   believed the grapes, even though he saw the giants,
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.100]   came back with a report and said,
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.700]   it is exceedingly good.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.660]   That one who is now 40 years older,
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.380]   stands next to Moses
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.140]   and I think there's a mixture of feelings on him.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.700]   Like me standing before the ocean that day,
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.060]   there's Joshua standing before the River Jordan once again,
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.500]   looking onto the beauty of that promised land.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.740]   And I think he's nervous and excited.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.060]   He's conscious of the mistakes
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.780]   that had been made in the past.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.500]   And he's filled with excitement
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.620]   for what God is about to do in the future.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.260]   I wonder if you've ever felt like you're standing
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.860]   in one of those moments in life.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.380]   Joshua's moments.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.700]   Over the last seven weeks,
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.740]   as we've looked at numbers 13 and 14,
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.700]   we've told you the story of Caleb, haven't we?
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.260]   Caleb's been the center character.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.740]   Caleb is the one with the different spirit,
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.620]   Caleb and Joshua, but Caleb took center stage
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.580]   and we spoke about his wholeheartedness and all of that.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.420]   And that was great.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.020]   But now we're at a point where they're about to cross in
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.820]   some 40 years later and the narrative shifts away
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.660]   from Caleb.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.260]   In fact, Caleb's hardly heard of again,
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260]   but Joshua takes center stage now.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.460]   And I want you to see what takes place here.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.820]   You see, wholeheartedness had gotten them
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.540]   to the point where they're on the edge of the land,
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.420]   but it would be courage and strength
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.620]   that would make them conquerors of that land.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.860]   Are you with me?
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.260]   The wholeheartedness got them right there to the edge,
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.980]   but it would be courage and strength
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.220]   that would bring them in.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.140]   And now Joshua is wondering, how do we take the next step?
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.220]   How do we actually move from a place of waiting
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.260]   to a place of action?
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.860]   I want you to hear this church.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.060]   40 years of waiting.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.540]   And now they're at this moment where waiting must turn
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.460]   into action.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.220]   And I believe here in Hong Kong, in the hour that we're in,
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.580]   in this moment of our city,
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.300]   it's time for us to stop waiting.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.260]   I think waiting finishes and we have to now move forward
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.740]   in action.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.660]   And the one thing that we're gonna need
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.820]   more than anything else,
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.820]   as we step into the place of action, strength and courage.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.060]   I wanna say this right over you, right here at the start.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.420]   I believe God's got something so important
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.460]   that is you shaped, you unique.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:19.260]   And I believe that what he's calling you to
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:24.260]   is so important and so beyond your natural abilities.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.340]   If it wasn't, he wouldn't be calling you into it.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.180]   That you're going to need more strength and courage
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.780]   for what's ahead.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.660]   And so I wanna unpack this message for you today
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.660]   to help you to understand what strength and courage
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.980]   might mean for you in your situation, in your context,
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.540]   what it might mean for us as a city
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.180]   in our time here in Hong Kong right now.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.540]   Does that sound all right?
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.580]   And I wanna go to this passage where God,
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.420]   just before Joshua takes his first step,
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.540]   says some very important things to him
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.060]   about this idea of what strength and courage is.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.260]   This is found in Joshua 1, verse one.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.460]   After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord,
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.100]   the Lord said to Joshua, son of Nun, Moses' aid,
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.260]   Moses, my servant is dead.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.460]   Now then, you and all these people get ready
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.020]   to cross the Jordan River into the land
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.340]   that I'm about to give them to the Israelites.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.700]   I will give you every place where you set your foot,
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.100]   as I promised Moses.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.860]   Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon,
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.700]   from the great river to the great sea on the west.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.100]   No one will be able to stand up against you
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.780]   all of the days of your life, for as I was with Moses,
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.660]   so I will now be with you.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.800]   I will never leave you or forsake you.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   I want you to see the important thing
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.540]   that God does with Joshua in this moment.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.280]   First of all, he doesn't mince his words.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.200]   He tells him straight up, Moses is dead.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.320]   Now that would have meant something for Joshua.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.480]   That was his mentor, his leader, the one he has followed,
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.140]   the one he's obeyed, the one he's actually been an aid to,
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.440]   the one he's given his life to.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.280]   God says, that guy can't be your support anymore.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.520]   Moses is dead, but then he says this really important thing.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.360]   He says, now I want you to get ready
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.160]   to cross the Jordan River into the land
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.440]   that I'm about to give to you, the Israelites.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.560]   He says this, Moses might be dead,
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.480]   but the mission I have for you is not dead.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.420]   I want you to follow this.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.840]   The man himself has died,
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.200]   but the mission of God has not died with him.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.760]   That God's mission is bigger and broader
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.400]   than the individual.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.340]   That's important for some of you to sit here and hear.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.200]   That you might think that everything is formed
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.400]   and shaped around you.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.040]   No, no, God has broader and bigger plans
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.940]   than just the one person.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.540]   The vine is not about Andrew.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.560]   This church and your faith is not about your leaders
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.120]   or your pastors.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.280]   There is a much bigger, broader thing.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.120]   Moses is dead.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.880]   At some point in the near future,
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.900]   I won't be your senior pastor anymore.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:03.720]   And the anointing and the power will shift to someone else.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.820]   And God's work will continue
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.480]   because God has a plan for his people.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.520]   And that plan involves people,
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.380]   but is not linked so much to people
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.920]   that when those people make mistakes,
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.200]   when those people don't do right,
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.400]   when those people disobey,
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.520]   that the whole thing is thwarted.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.040]   Some of you need to realize
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.560]   that the mission you're caught up in
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.580]   is way bigger than you realize.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.400]   Now, why is that important?
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.560]   It's important because what God's doing in this moment
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.240]   is he's creating the foundation for Joshua's courage.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.600]   He's basically saying to Joshua,
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.800]   it's not about you, buddy.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.160]   It's not your mission.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.440]   It's not your idea.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.600]   It's not your strength.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.960]   It's not what you're going to do.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.360]   No, it's my mission.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.760]   I've always decreed this.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.560]   40 years ago, I wanted you to do it.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.200]   And out of rebellion, you didn't.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.680]   And now 40 years it's taken,
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.640]   but that mission has not died.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.120]   It's my will, my way.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.200]   Your courage comes from actually realizing
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.160]   that it's not about you.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.280]   'Cause if it is in our courage,
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.680]   we're gonna have a tendency,
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.120]   listen to this,
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.600]   of turning dolphins into sharks.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:27.080]   So God says to Joshua, this is going to happen.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.180]   Are you with me?
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.560]   Not only that, but he says, I'm with you.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.920]   We're in this together.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.880]   Partnership moving into the land.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.240]   You see, you need to understand
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.560]   that courage always comes from mission.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.280]   In just the same way as faith always comes from challenge.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.480]   Courage is always linked to mission.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.000]   I'm not gonna stand in front of you today
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.560]   and ask you to be courageous for courageous sake.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.680]   I'm gonna ask you to be courageous for something.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.240]   And it's that something,
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.280]   it's how you define that something
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.640]   that'll be the foundation of your courage.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.760]   The thing that wakes you up in the morning
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.800]   and you say, I'm a child of God.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.720]   The thing that wakes you up and says,
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.600]   I have something to say to this city,
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.240]   to my company, to my family, to my spouse.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.280]   The thing that wakes you up in the morning
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.280]   and says, because of the gospel, there is hope.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.620]   That something that curves through your veins
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.040]   and pumps your blood and makes you excited
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.320]   to be alive in Hong Kong
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.240]   and a Christian for the gospel and in time.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.720]   That thing, you need to discover what that is.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.480]   'Cause it's that thing where you'll find your courage.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.360]   It's linking that thing to the bigger thing
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.080]   that God is at work in that will help you know
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.680]   and feel that God is with you.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.760]   Is this making sense?
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.600]   You okay?
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.440]   Feels really quiet in here.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.360]   Is that all right?
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.560]   Good.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.120]   Notice what happens next.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.360]   Thank you, baby.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.660]   Baby's like, yeah, go for it, preach it.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.240]   Verse six, be strong and courageous
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.400]   because you will lead these people to inherit the land
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.600]   that I swore to their forefathers to give them.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.280]   Be strong and very courageous.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.320]   Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.480]   Do not turn from it from the right to the left
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.920]   that you may be successful wherever you go.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.800]   Do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   Meditate on it day and night
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.420]   so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.080]   Then you will be prosperous and successful.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.440]   Have I not commanded you?
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.640]   Be strong and courageous.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.640]   Do not be terrified.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.960]   Do not be discouraged for the Lord your God will be with you
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.360]   wherever you go.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.440]   Three times, notice this.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.040]   God says to Joshua, be strong and courageous.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.380]   And you need to know, God does not have a speech impediment.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.480]   God is intentionally trying to drill something
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.520]   into this young man, well, he's not young, he's old,
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.320]   into this old man,
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.880]   it's 'cause I see so many young people in this room.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.000]   He's trying to drill something into this person
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.880]   and he's trying to say, you need to be strong and courageous.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.640]   Be strong and courageous, be strong and courageous.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.880]   It's that important.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.440]   And so I stand over you as divine church.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.960]   If you're a part of this church community,
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.820]   then there's an authority in this place
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.360]   for us to be in relationship spiritually as well.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.200]   I stand over you and I say for Hong Kong, for this hour,
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.560]   be strong and courageous.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.040]   Before you take one step,
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.680]   find the courage and the strength
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.680]   to join me in missions in this hour.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.320]   It was important for him to hear it
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.840]   before he took that step.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.980]   I feel in my spirit, it's important for you to hear it.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.580]   There are some of us in this room
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:56.120]   who are in danger of turning dolphins into sharks
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.080]   because we're still a little bit consumed by the giants.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.880]   God's rolling out a red carpet, I believe, for you
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.620]   in whatever it is that God is releasing you into.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:11.220]   And he's saying, be strong and courageous.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.300]   Do not fear.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.240]   There are three specific things
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.520]   that God says to Joshua to be strong and courageous about.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   And I wanna tell you that these three specific things
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.560]   are the things that I think all of us
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.040]   need to be strong and courageous in,
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.520]   regardless of what the something is
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.600]   that God has called us to,
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.160]   regardless of whatever mission is on you,
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.240]   regardless of whatever call is upon your life,
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.800]   regardless of whatever's going on in your life right now.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.540]   These three things that God calls Joshua
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.360]   to be strong and courageous in
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.880]   are, I believe, three fundamental biblical principles
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.120]   of things that all of us need to find courage in
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.520]   if we're going to move forward
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.800]   in the mission of God in our lives.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.400]   Here's the first one, verse six.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.180]   Be strong and courageous
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.960]   because you will lead these people to inherit the land
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.160]   that I swore to their fathers to give them.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.760]   The first thing is leadership.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.880]   We have to be strong and courageous in leadership.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.300]   And before I say anything else,
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.880]   when I talk about leadership,
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.200]   I'm not talking about me or my title here at the Vine.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.320]   I'm not talking about the leadership of the Vine Church.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.440]   I'm not talking about your boss in your office.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.000]   I'm not talking about the leader of your family.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.080]   I'm talking about you.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.920]   You are a leader
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.640]   'cause God has given you a sphere of influence,
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.760]   some place where you have some sort of influence,
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.360]   some sort of authority.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.240]   For some of us, it's a big influence and a big authority.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.200]   For some of us, it's a smaller influence
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.480]   and a smaller authority.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.520]   God does not look at those two things differently.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.200]   He doesn't think, "Oh, the leaders of more are the better."
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.600]   So every single one of us has leadership authority
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.280]   because we are the children of God
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.360]   living the kingdom of God in the brokenness of this world.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.840]   So I want you to hear leadership about you.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.120]   Now, God turns up to Joshua
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.960]   and he understands that Joshua's got a difficult job,
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.200]   that leading Israel is not an easy thing.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.440]   And so he comes to him and says,
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.760]   "You need strength and courage for your leadership
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.840]   in what's ahead."
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.280]   I think it's very obvious to us
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.760]   that in our world right now,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.040]   we are suffering from a failure of leadership
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.920]   over the last couple of years.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.040]   I think if there's one thing
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.280]   that this world is really struggling with,
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.680]   it is finding good leaders.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.560]   Instead, what's happened is somehow politically,
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.480]   somehow within the boardroom,
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.240]   somehow we've redefined leadership to be this,
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.080]   that leadership now, the characteristics of leadership
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.040]   is so often name-calling.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.000]   It's so often character assassination.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.080]   It's so often shaming.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.200]   It's so often manipulation of the media.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.040]   It's so often trying to push people
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.920]   to extreme points of view.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.920]   And if you're not on my side of the extreme point of view,
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.400]   you're a hater and you're the enemy.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.480]   Leadership has become incredibly divisive.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.360]   And for some reason,
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.880]   people think that that's how power is given now.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.640]   And before we as Christians begin to point out too much,
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.720]   the speck in everybody else's eyes,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.800]   we need to stop and realize there's a big, huge plank in ours.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.880]   Over the last 2000 years,
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.320]   the church has suffered many times
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.040]   for a failure of leadership.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.200]   Just in the recent six months,
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.480]   we've seen celebrity pastors, famous NGO leaders,
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   Christians who have fallen from grace.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.920]   That fall impacts all of us.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.120]   It's hard, isn't it?
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.200]   For all of us when we see that.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.440]   And we realize that this failure of leadership
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.800]   is happening both in the world,
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.560]   it's happening also in the church,
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.800]   and we're all a part of it.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.400]   And God is standing over his people and he's saying,
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.320]   who's gonna be strong and courageous in leadership?
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.680]   I mean, who's gonna be willing to stand
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.440]   for godly principles in how they lead in their office,
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.040]   in their family, in their school?
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.880]   Who's gonna stand for authenticity?
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.240]   Who's gonna stand for vulnerability and humility?
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.320]   Who's gonna make a stand to love the other as yourself?
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   Who's gonna be the first person willing to say, I'm sorry?
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.760]   Like who's gonna be willing to step forward
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.200]   with the kind of leadership that we see in Jesus Christ?
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.440]   That kind of leadership takes a huge amount of courage.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.400]   Because everything else around you is going to tell you
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.600]   that the way you get influence and power these days
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.800]   is by doing the name calling, and the character assassination
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.520]   and manipulating the media and doing all these things.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.600]   And for you to say, no, I actually believe
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.240]   with a different spirit that there's a different way.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.760]   That actually maybe if I'm more grace-filled
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.920]   and grace-loving, things might change.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.480]   So I think there's people in this room
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.600]   where in the very near future,
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.200]   you're gonna have to have courage
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.520]   to stand up in your boardroom
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.840]   and to stand against a policy that puts profit over people.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.600]   Some of you in this room,
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   you're gonna have to have the courage
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.200]   to stand in your classroom,
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.960]   or as a parent, stand over your child
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.520]   and stand for biblical values that are at threat.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.040]   I think there's some people in this room
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.480]   where you're gonna have to stand over that relationship
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.600]   that's broken in your life,
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.800]   and you're gonna have to exhibit some godly leadership
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.760]   and say, you know what?
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.720]   I'm also responsible for this breakdown.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.680]   I've made mistakes.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.240]   Would you forgive me
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.480]   that there might be a rising up of the church
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   to take on an idea of what strong and courageous leadership
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.800]   might truly look like?
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.720]   Let me put it this way.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.920]   If we have any hope of moving the needle in Hong Kong
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.160]   and helping this city heal from all of its pain
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.600]   over the last couple of years,
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.640]   if we have any hope of seeing people come together
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.240]   in this city in more unity,
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.080]   any hope of being able to build a new character
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.560]   and a new identity for Hong Kong in the years ahead,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.800]   it will come if we rise up
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.880]   with a strong and courageous leadership
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.600]   that holds boldly forth the idea of integrity and hope
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   that is found in the person of Jesus.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:04.280]   Like we are being called right now in this hour
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.520]   to hold forth that kind of hope.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.480]   Where are the leaders?
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.040]   They're sitting in this room.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.920]   Be strong and courageous.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.440]   Here's the second thing.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.080]   Verse seven, be strong and very courageous.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.640]   Be careful to obey all that the law
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.960]   my servant Moses has given you.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.840]   Do not turn from the right or to the left
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.920]   that you may be successful wherever you go.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.200]   Do not let this book of law depart from your mouth.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.080]   Meditate it day and night
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.720]   so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.560]   Then you'll be prosperous and successful.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.520]   The second thing you're going to need strength
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.000]   and courage in is obedience.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   It's going to be really difficult to remain obedient
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.800]   to the ways of Jesus in this fast changing world
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.640]   that we're in.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.600]   And God understood for Joshua
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.760]   that disobedience had led Israel
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.680]   into a 40 year wandering in the wilderness.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.640]   A 40 year of wandering around
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.840]   before they were ready to go in.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.640]   And God knew that if there was one thing
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.920]   that he needs courage in, it is to be obedient.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.360]   Obedient to God's word, obedient to God's promises.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.760]   He wants to speak that life into him.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.240]   Notice God doesn't ask him to be more obedient.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:24.440]   God challenges him to have courage in his obedience.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.880]   And this is so important for all of us
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.920]   because I think in some ways
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.280]   that's where we need the courage
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.680]   to actually stand for what it is that we believe.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.000]   To actually stand for the things of Christ
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.480]   in a broken world.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.080]   To actually offer the obedience to the Lord
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.000]   despite whether that obedience might lose that promotion,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.960]   might cause us to lose some friends.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.720]   Obedience to Christ takes courage.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.160]   And it takes courage in this world like never before.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   Christ is gonna call you at some point in the near future
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.320]   to let go of things that are ugly in you
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.920]   that you don't wanna let go of.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.800]   That will take courage.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   God's gonna call you in this near future
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.600]   to take a stand for the gospel
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.240]   when it seems that that's now socially unacceptable to do.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.280]   That will take courage from you.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.800]   Some of us might lose jobs
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.920]   because we hold on to values and morals
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.200]   that are contrary to what our companies are doing.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.080]   That will take courage from you.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.000]   And I've been saying this for this whole year,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.760]   I'm gonna keep saying it.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.160]   When you're in the reality of the worst moment of your life,
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.520]   somebody else's faith is not gonna cut it for you.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.120]   It's your faith and the courage that you have
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.080]   to take a moral stand, a spiritual stand,
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.560]   a stand in faith and say,
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.720]   this is what I believe God's doing in this city
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.240]   and I will align all of myself to it.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.320]   So where does the courage come from
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.080]   to be obedient to God like that?
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.120]   Well, notice what Moses says in verse,
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.480]   sorry, Joshua says here in verse eight.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.760]   Oh God, actually.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.920]   Do not let this book of the Lord depart from your mouth.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.000]   Meditate on it day and night
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.760]   so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.920]   God says, this is where your courage comes from,
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.040]   knowing the word.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.040]   Like I'm not asking you to fabricate some courage,
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.440]   but if you're gonna have courage
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.880]   to be obedient to what I'm saying,
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.320]   that courage is gonna come from knowing what I'm saying,
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.960]   from understanding my heart, understanding my promises,
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.760]   making those, meditating on those,
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.040]   thinking about them, praying about them,
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.040]   using them on your lips,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.720]   speaking them out over one another,
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.040]   standing in front of each other,
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.600]   reminding each other of gospel stories of a centurion
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.240]   who can change your life.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.480]   Like these are the things, meditate, speak
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.040]   on the word of God.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.600]   You will need courage in the years ahead here in Hong Kong.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.880]   And your courage will come from your dependency
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.280]   and familiarity of God's word.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:50.960]   We've done like five messages this year
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.080]   about the scriptures and the importance of God's word.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.400]   I wonder if you're seeing a repetitive theme
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.280]   here at the Vine.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.200]   It's time for us to know it, soak in it, read it,
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.720]   memorize it, have it,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.200]   because the sword of the spirit will be needed,
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.720]   which is the word of God.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.200]   Be strong and very courageous.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.040]   Here's the third and final one.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.880]   Verse nine, "Have I not commanded you?
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.080]   "Be strong and courageous.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.120]   "Do not be terrified, do not be discouraged,
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.160]   "for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.680]   "Do not fear and do not be discouraged."
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.800]   Two things that God is saying to Joshua,
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.000]   you need courage, not to be fearful,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.840]   courage, not to be discouraged.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.040]   Now, I dealt with fear a few weeks ago in this series.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.720]   I did a whole message on the fear cycle, the faith cycle.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.620]   I'm not gonna speak about fear this morning,
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.800]   but if that's something that you didn't hear,
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.560]   go back online, grab it and listen to it.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   I wanna talk now then briefly about discouragement.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.160]   We don't talk about this a lot, I don't think,
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.880]   in the church, but discouragement has such an impact on us.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.400]   Discouragement happens when you've made a mistake
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.200]   and you feel bad about it,
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.000]   where you have regrets of things that you've done
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.680]   in the past and those regrets begin to shape
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.440]   who you are in the present.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.160]   Discouragement is like a heaviness that comes upon you,
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:14.160]   like you're wearing some big, heavy cloak.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.800]   And God shows up to Joshua,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.760]   and God knows that in Joshua's life,
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.480]   he has suffered discouragement.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.120]   He knows that Joshua has been with the people
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.360]   wandering for 40 years.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.640]   He knows that Joshua has made mistakes in his past,
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.080]   that Joshua is not perfect.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.320]   And he knows that those mistakes
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.520]   are trying to hold him back.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.640]   You see, I think God realizes
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.440]   that the brokenness of Joshua's past
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.660]   has the potential to hold him back
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.320]   from the freedom of his future.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.240]   And so God comes to Joshua and says,
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.040]   "You need to have courage
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.980]   "in overcoming your discouragement."
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.480]   So let me preach on this for one moment,
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.480]   because I think this is important
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.140]   for some people in this room.
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:55.020]   It's like you're carrying around sadness and regret
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:58.900]   and guilt and shame from stuff that you've done in your past.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.300]   And that is now coloring who you are today
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.700]   and the direction you're going in the future.
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.700]   And guess what?
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.940]   It is not easy to let go of your past.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.060]   It will take courage for you
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.060]   to overcome the heaviness of your mistakes.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.420]   It's gonna take great courage for you
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.060]   to be able to overcome the heaviness
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.100]   of the mistakes that you've made.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.100]   But I tell you, the number one thing
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.520]   that will move you into freedom
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.740]   is not to walk into your future facing backwards,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.820]   looking back on all the stuff that's broken and wrong
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.260]   and done and thinking that you're on plan B.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.880]   The number one thing that will release you
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.180]   into God's mission is the courage
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.120]   to let go of what you don't need.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.300]   Let me say it this way.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.300]   The first step in getting what God needs
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.340]   is having the courage to let go of what God doesn't.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.140]   Come on, church.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:58.100]   The courage to let go of what God doesn't need in your life.
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.460]   The things that you're carrying
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.300]   that he's long forgiven you for.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.420]   The things that you're still dragging around
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.180]   that he's like, "Why is that still with you?
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.820]   "That is gone, whiter than snow.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.020]   "I've washed you clean.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.220]   "Yeah, that was a bad thing.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.460]   "Yes, there are consequences.
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.260]   "I've wiped it out of my memory.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.860]   "You are moving forward now,
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:18.060]   "forgiven and restored as a person of Christ."
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.140]   And I wonder whether we would have the courage
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:26.720]   to not let the enemy win with discouragement.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.780]   Some of you are sitting here and you're like,
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.720]   "Wow, that sounds like a lot of work."
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.660]   And you're so discouraged,
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.020]   and I felt like this sometimes in my life,
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.840]   so I understand this.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.220]   You're so discouraged that you don't even know how to start.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.660]   You don't even know if you have the energy to start.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.100]   "Wow, it sounds like a lot, Andrew,
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.360]   "to have to face the brokenness of my past,
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.220]   "have to allow all those emotions to come,
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.660]   "have to give that to God.
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.780]   "That sounds like a huge amount of work."
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:52.700]   And you know what?
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.140]   There is a process often in finding freedom
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.420]   from the things that have so oppressed us.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.420]   But I read a quote this week that really encouraged me.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.420]   I hope it encourages you.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.580]   Let me read this to you.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.940]   "Courage doesn't always roar.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.120]   "Sometimes courage is the quiet voice
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.560]   "at the end of the day saying,
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.100]   "'I will try again tomorrow.'"
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.820]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.360]   Like, "I'm gonna get back in the water
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.620]   "with my scuba gear the next day,
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.880]   "and I'm gonna really try my best
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.820]   "to not turn a dolphin into a shark.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.640]   "I will take courage that I'm working on a mission
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.280]   "that is God's mission, not mine."
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.200]   And as Joshua is trying to let go of his discouragement,
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   I want you to see where he can find the hope to do that.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.400]   Right at the end of verse nine,
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.840]   "God will be with you wherever you go,
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.200]   "no matter what's going on for you,
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.500]   "no matter where you are, I will be with you.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.520]   "Feeling completely in despair, I will be there.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.680]   "Struggling with the pain of your mistakes,
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.800]   "I will meet you there.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.180]   "Holding back on your depression,
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.000]   "not knowing how to move forward with joy,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.840]   "I'll meet you there.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.920]   "Upset because you cheated on your spouse
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.740]   "and you've never really dealt with the guilt of it,
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.580]   "I will be there for you.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:09.460]   "But you will need to be courageous
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.340]   "to maybe admit some things,
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.940]   "reconcile some things, bring your hurt to me."
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.380]   So God turns to Joshua and he says,
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:26.020]   "The hope will come because I haven't given up on you.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.400]   "I haven't left you, I haven't forsaken you.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   "I'm right here with you, so be strong and courageous."
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.680]   There's a moment in the New Testament
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.080]   where the disciples are really struggling.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.220]   They've watched their best friend murdered on a cross.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.220]   They've seen him raised, they've talked to him.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.100]   They've heard his hope for them.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.940]   They know he's about to ascend up into the heavens,
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.260]   but they're struggling with the reality of what comes next.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:59.260]   What do we do when our risen Savior is no longer with us?
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.180]   And I want to read you some words
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.700]   that Jesus speaks over his fearful disciples.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.940]   He brings them up a mountain,
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.620]   much like Moses and Joshua standing on a mountain
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.180]   overlooking the promised land.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.560]   Jesus brings the disciples up to a mountain
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.220]   so that they could look over the Greco-Roman Empire.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.300]   And here's what he says to them in Matthew 28.
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.940]   He says, "All authority in heaven and earth
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.040]   "has been given to me.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.380]   "So now go and make disciples of all nations,
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.780]   "baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.900]   "and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.420]   "everything I have commanded you.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.780]   "And surely I am with you always
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.780]   "to the very end of the age."
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.740]   I wonder if that sounds like anything.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.900]   That God shows up to Joshua and says,
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.060]   I want you to move forward.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.140]   Be strong and courageous as you lead.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.420]   Be strong and courageous as you experience obedience.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.140]   Be strong and courageous to overcome your fear,
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.380]   overcome your discouragement.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.940]   I will always be with you.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.020]   So Jesus stands in front of the disciples
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.980]   and in relation stands in front of you and I
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.540]   here in Hong Kong in this hour.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:01.060]   And he says, "You too be strong and courageous
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.740]   "for there's a mission also for you.
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.940]   "Go into the world, make disciples."
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.380]   That's my mission.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.980]   It's bigger than any one person.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.500]   It's bigger than any one church,
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.500]   but in partnership together, we can go.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.460]   Go into that world, make disciples,
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.420]   teach them to obey, baptize them,
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.220]   immerse them in the character of the Father,
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.220]   the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.660]   And as you do that, guess what?
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.420]   I will be with you.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.900]   So be strong and courageous.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:32.100]   As we finish this series, we don't finish the mission.
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:32.980]   We start it.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:37.860]   And this is your moment to step up and step forward,
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.780]   to move from waiting to action.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:45.580]   The Holy Spirit would say, "Be strong and courageous."
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.620]   Would you stand with me?
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.660]   I wanna pray for you.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:57.660]   And I wanna encourage you if you're comfortable
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.940]   just to open your hands as I pray.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.220]   I wanna commission you for the something
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.500]   that is in your life.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.380]   For that thing that you are a leader on
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.380]   and over in your life.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.140]   For that thing that gets you up in the morning,
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.420]   for that thing that makes you excited,
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.980]   for the joy that sits in you,
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.740]   for that call for the mission of God
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.260]   to go into the world and make disciples.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.260]   And whatever that may manifest in your workplace
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.420]   or in your family or in your community,
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:32.420]   you have a unique God-shaped passion on you
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.500]   that no one else can do and fulfill.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.420]   And so I stand before you today.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:46.740]   And as God stands over you, He says, "Lead well."
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:53.060]   He says, "Obey my word."
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:58.420]   And He says to you, "Overcome fear and discouragement."
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.300]   "Be strong and courageous."
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.620]   Father, our hands are open before you,
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.820]   your people in this city, in this place, in this hour.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.540]   Father, I pray as we finish the series
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:19.540]   that you would release over each person right now
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:24.740]   the courage to stand for you in a broken world.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.620]   I pray you would release the courage
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.340]   to lead in ways that honor the gospel.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.300]   I pray, Lord, you would give each person in this room
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:38.300]   the courage to stand for you when others aren't.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.540]   I pray, Lord, you give the people in this room
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.100]   the courage to not turn dolphins into sharks,
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.060]   the courage to leave behind their regrets
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.220]   and their shame and their failures
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.620]   and to move forward, not perfect, but forgiven.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.340]   Father, fill them with courage.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.580]   Father, fill them with your courage.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:06.620]   Bring them alive in joy and boldness
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.500]   and the authority that comes from the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:15.620]   Send them into their workplaces and schools,
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.620]   into their families, into their communities,
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.020]   their spheres of influence,
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:25.020]   with a boldness that holds forth the gospel for this time.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.260]   We will not be afraid.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.420]   We will not be afraid.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.780]   We will see the grapes.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.300]   Holy Spirit, we will repent when we need to.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.300]   God, we want the whole of our hearts to be with you.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.740]   Father, we want to know you, be in relationship with you
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.260]   more than the things that we do, Lord.
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.420]   And we need strength and courage for the fight.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.300]   So fill us again with faith.
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.900]   (gentle music)
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:01.700]   Allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you now.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.280]   (gentle music)
