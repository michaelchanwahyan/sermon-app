1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
 One of the things that we're doing here in the month of June and July at the Vine is

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,680
 Branches of Hope Awareness Month.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,160
 If you've been coming to the Vine for a while, you'll know that Branches of Hope is the NGO

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,040
 that the Vine supports as part of the wider ministry of our church, where we're working

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,560
 with two groups of vulnerable people in our city, asylum seekers and refugees, and those

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,040
 that are caught up in forced labor or human trafficking in our city.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,080
 And so we serve those two areas through the work of Branches of Hope.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,560
 And Branches of Hope Awareness Month is a month that starts on World Refugee Day, that

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,880
 starts on June 20th, just last week, and goes all the way to July 30th, where we have World

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,760
 Day Against the Trafficking of Persons.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,440
 And in between that time, we celebrate the work that we do in this NGO.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,000
 And there's a bunch of things that are happening over the month, both internally here at the

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,400
 Vine, also externally out in the city.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,000
 Find out more about that, you can just go to branchesofhope.org.hk/Boham, branchesofhope.org.hk/Boham.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,560
 Branches of Hope Awareness Month 2022, and that'll be a way to find out a little bit

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
 more.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,960
 There's two events that are coming up that I wanted to highlight today.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,920
 The first is we're gonna have Branches of Hope Sunday next week.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,240
 So next week, our whole service is gonna be focused on the work that we do with asylum

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,200
 seekers and refugees, as well as those caught up in trafficking in Hong Kong.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,640
 And we're gonna be telling you a lot more about that work.

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,480
 What we're calling it is our voices and our stories.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,200
 And what we're gonna be doing is letting you hear the voices of the various clients that

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,360
 we serve in those two areas.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,840
 And so you're gonna hear their personal stories, you're gonna hear what it's like for them

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,880
 to be in Hong Kong at this time, the challenges that they face.

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,320
 And that's gonna be a great way for you to be a little bit more informed about some of

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,360
 the vulnerable groups that we serve and how you also can be involved in helping the work

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,440
 of Branches of Hope here in Hong Kong.

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,840
 So that will be next Sunday.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,360
 And then starting on July 9th, there's an incredible restaurant in Hong Kong called

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
 Orca.

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,580
 It's run by two people from the Vine Church.

34
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,880
 It's on Wyndham Street.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,920
 If you've never been there for food, I can highly recommend it.

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
 They're not paying me to say this.

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,680
 But they're gonna be hosting a photography exhibition that's based on the idea of our

38
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,280
 voices and our stories, a photography exhibition that tells the story of some of the clients

39
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,240
 that Branches of Hope serve.

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,380
 So from July 9th onwards, you can go to Orca Restaurant on Wyndham Street.

41
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,980
 You can have a fantastic meal with you and your family.

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,360
 And then the proceeds from some of the meals will be given to Branches of Hope, as well

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,080
 as the photography exhibition will be there in the restaurant.

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,480
 So you can check that out.

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,760
 And it's a great way of telling friends and family a little bit about that work for vulnerable

46
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,400
 people, which can also lead into a great conversation about Jesus.

47
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,240
 So check out the restaurant.

48
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,760
 Check out that photography exhibition.

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,880
 I think that'll be a blessing to you.

50
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,560
 Well, this week ahead for Hong Kong is one of the most important weeks in Hong Kong's

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
 history.

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,160
 July 1st is this Friday.

53
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,960
 It's not just a day off.

54
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,240
 It's a significant day for leadership transition in our city.

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,400
 That's not every July 1st, but this year, because we've had a transition in our chief

56
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,920
 executive, that transition takes place on July 1st.

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,800
 Carrie Lam will be handing over as chief executive, and John Lee will be becoming our new chief

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,600
 executive, and his cabinet is all being sworn in on that day.

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,040
 We also heard this week that Xi Jinping is going to be visiting Hong Kong on July 1st.

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,080
 He's going to be a part of that transition process.

61
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,960
 Whether there's change or transition of any leadership in any city or any country, that

62
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,080
 requires a prayer.

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,520
 It requires a sense of understanding what's happening in our city.

64
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,600
 And the Scriptures are very clear that we are to pray for those who are in governing

65
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,520
 authority over us.

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,720
 We know in Scripture that our ultimate authority is God and God alone.

67
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,800
 Paul in Ephesians says, "His is the name that is above every name," another way of translating

68
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
 that.

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
 "His is the title above every other title."

70
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,920
 In other words, every authority sits under Jesus Christ.

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,960
 At the same time, the Bible encourages us to pray for the human authorities that govern

72
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,000
 us so that our lives will go well, so that they'll be flourishing in the land, and that

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,200
 is something that we think is important to do here at the Vine.

74
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,880
 And so with this week ahead of us, with July 1st right there, we wanted to take some time

75
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,680
 in this service to really pray and pray for that leadership transition in our cities.

76
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
 Does that sound good?

77
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
 So, can I invite you all to stand?

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,960
 Again, I know it's a little bit like yoga today, up and down, up and down, up and down.

79
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,560
 But we want to stand before the Lord as we pray for Hong Kong and as we pray for this

80
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
 leadership transition.

81
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,600
 And I just want to say, no matter how you might feel about the leadership in this city,

82
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,160
 no matter how you might feel about that transition, we need to pray and pray that the Spirit of

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,800
 God would bless our city.

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,520
 So let's pray.

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,000
 Father, we just come before you today with Hong Kong as we come into this important week

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,280
 of our city's history.

87
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,320
 Father, the first thing we want to do is pray for Carrie Lam.

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,480
 Lord, we want to pray as she transitions out from being chief executive and back into normal

89
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,720
 private life.

90
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,520
 And Lord, we know that she has stressed in the last couple of weeks that her desire is

91
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,600
 to rest and spend time with her family.

92
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,520
 So Lord, we want to pray for that transition for her.

93
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,880
 We can't understand what it is that she must be going through as she thinks about handing

94
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,420
 over the reins of leadership in this city and spending more time with her family.

95
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,200
 But we do want to pray that you would give her rest.

96
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,080
 We do want to pray that you would restore and strengthen her relationships with her

97
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,880
 loved ones and Lord, that that would be a time of flourishing for her.

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,200
 Lord, we pray for John Lee as he steps in to take on leadership here in Hong Kong.

99
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,200
 Lord, we ask that you would give him great wisdom and strength for the work that you're

100
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,680
 going to require of him.

101
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,840
 Lord, we pray that he would have justice on his heart.

102
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,860
 Lord, we pray that you would bless him with your spirit to lead to the best of his ability,

103
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,860
 Lord.

104
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,620
 Lord, we pray for the cabinet that's being sworn in around him.

105
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,640
 We thank you for the men and women that he has raised up and Lord, we pray that you would

106
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,980
 also place your hand upon them and guide them.

107
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,580
 Lord, we pray for the churches of this city, knowing that you have called us to be your

108
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,540
 hands and feet in this time.

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,120
 Lord, we ask that you would cause the church to be in prayer for its city in this time.

110
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,920
 Lord, we know that the ultimate hope of any city, of any nation is the local church.

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,180
 And so Lord, we want to pray for the infusing of your spirit and your power upon your local

112
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,980
 church to be your hands and feet in this time, in this hour.

113
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,380
 That we would be on our knees praying for those that lead us, that we'd be on our knees

114
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,360
 praying for justice, that we'd be on our knees praying for the gospel to have its greatest

115
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,820
 fruit in our city like never before.

116
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,720
 As we just prayed earlier, we pray that the church in this city is not defeated and Lord,

117
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,240
 we pray that you would release us as a prayer people dedicated for blessing our city so

118
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,280
 that all that live in it, and we say all that live in it, would flourish.

119
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,280
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name, everyone says.

120
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
 Amen.

121
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
 Thank you so much.

122
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 You can have a seat again.

123
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
 No, actually stand up again.

124
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
 No, just kidding.

125
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
 Don't stand up again.

126
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
 No, no, you can have a seat.

127
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
 Sorry, I'm gonna make you up and down.

128
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
 I just like doing that.

129
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,880
 We're gonna move into a time of offering today and as we do our offering, it's just a way

130
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,440
 of us giving our worship to Christ and making sure that what he's given us, we're able to

131
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
 give freely.

132
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,280
 And you're gonna be hearing a little bit more about that in our message today.

133
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,480
 But we always do offering right now digitally as well as touchless as we're calling it in

134
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,520
 this time of COVID-19.

135
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,480
 On your chair, there's an envelope.

136
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,080
 If you wanna give digitally, you just scan the QR codes.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,640
 If you wanna give through a cash, credit card, or check, you could do that by filling in

138
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
 the envelope that's on your chair.

139
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,400
 And then after the service, either on the fourth floor or here on the second floor,

140
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
 just walk out.

141
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,640
 There's a little kind of see-through sort of plastic box.

142
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,200
 You can put your envelope in there and that's a way for you to be able to do your offering.

143
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,960
 Let me pray for us as we come in to do that today.

144
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,800
 Father, we thank you for the gift that it is to share in giving.

145
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,640
 Lord, we thank you that you called us to be stewards of the resources that you've given

146
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
 to us.

147
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,960
 Lord, as we steward those resources well, Lord, we pray that we would do so without

148
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
 strings attached.

149
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,280
 Our hands would be open before you.

150
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,840
 That Lord, we would give to you, Lord, knowing and trusting that you know exactly what it

151
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,560
 is that the vine needs.

152
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,960
 And Lord, we know that exactly what is given is what you want to bless this church with.

153
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,240
 Lord, I pray that you would help us as the vine to be open-handed towards the needs that

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
 are within our community.

155
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,440
 You would help us also to be open-handed towards the missions and ministry organizations that

156
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,880
 we support as a church.

157
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,760
 Lord, that we would do this because it is part of that stewardship.

158
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,240
 And Lord, we recognize that as we give, we can never out-give you.

159
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,400
 And Lord, I want to pray for your resources to flow over every person in this room as

160
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,600
 they are open-handed as stewards of all the things that you've given them.

161
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,080
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name, everyone says, amen.

162
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,760
 Well, we're continuing our series, The Unfinished Story, together today.

163
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,400
 We've got a couple of more weeks left in the book of Acts as we've been studying and looking

164
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,120
 at discipleship and evangelism in the book of Acts.

165
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,000
 And today, we're looking at a really important passage where Paul comes and does a farewell

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,120
 with the elders of Ephesus.

167
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,480
 And it's such a beautiful, profound, and very personal story.

168
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,760
 And I couldn't think of anyone better to share that story with us than one of our elders,

169
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
 Sidney Yip.

170
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
 Can you put your hands together as Sidney comes?

171
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,840
 And I'm going to pray for Sidney.

172
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,320
 Father, just thank you so much for this man who, as chairman of our eldership, takes on

173
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,360
 a real mantle of responsibility and leadership here at the Vine, but does so with great humility

174
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
 and love.

175
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,040
 Lord, as he preaches out of what's a very personal story for Paul, and also a very personal

176
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,160
 story for Sidney, I pray that you would open our own hearts to what it is that you want

177
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
 to say to us.

178
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,880
 Would you challenge us, Lord, and change us?

179
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,240
 And we thank you for this.

180
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,240
 In Jesus' name, everyone says, "Amen."

181
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:08,040
 Hey, thank you, Andrew.

182
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,480
 Sorry.

183
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,840
 It was 25 years ago, in the year of 1997, that we bid farewell to this land, supposedly

184
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,240
 for good, and we emigrated to Singapore.

185
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,960
 While we were residing there, my parents made a difficult trip to come down and visit us

186
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,560
 and to spend time with us.

187
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,440
 I had a heart-to-heart talk with him.

188
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,840
 The honest question we had to ask is whether he would spend his last days with us, his

189
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:49,440
 next generation, in a foreign land, or he might choose to come back to Hong Kong, his

190
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,760
 hometown.

191
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,120
 But that would also mean that it would be the last time that we embrace him in this

192
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,120
 land of the living.

193
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,920
 We made the decision to fly back to Hong Kong with my mom while he could still travel, with

194
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,920
 full knowledge that that is very likely his last time.

195
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,320
 While God was gracious, we actually had a few other occasions whereby we traveled and

196
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,960
 visited him.

197
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,760
 In fact, the whole family, three siblings, we came back from three different countries

198
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,000
 with our next generation to witness his water baptism in the hospital ground.

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,280
 In a few weeks down the road, he was able to witness my mom's water baptism.

200
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,320
 And that very night, he passed on peacefully.

201
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,360
 What a farewell.

202
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,280
 And today we are going to refer to the farewell from Paul to the elders of Ephesus upon his

203
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,560
 rounding up his third missionary journey, on route to Jerusalem.

204
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:07,760
 So surely Paul has much to say to his church and to us, and we have much to learn.

205
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:15,280
 So Paul will set an example for us to live for Christ and to endure sufferings.

206
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,200
 He will encourage the elders, and indeed all of us, to shepherd over the flock.

207
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:29,680
 And last, none the least, that how we may give to be a blessing.

208
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,400
 Throughout this message, I will try to put together that binding to the Holy Spirit,

209
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:43,160
 that love by serving and watching over others, and giving are all integrated.

210
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:49,480
 But I think it would be helpful that we do a quick recap of the ministry of Paul in Ephesus.

211
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:57,120
 After all, he spent two years in this mission station, much longer than any others, including

212
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,280
 Corinth.

213
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:07,480
 He ministered in Ephesus, and he performed extraordinary miracles of healing, of ministry,

214
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,920
 of the Word.

215
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,800
 And in fact, there is this comic story.

216
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,560
 A family of seven sons of a Jewish priest, they imitated Paul and invoked the name of

217
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,200
 Jesus Christ to practice exorcism.

218
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:30,680
 But of course, the demon won't listen to them, and in fact, those sons were badly beaten

219
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,000
 up by the demons.

220
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,680
 But that gave an awe and fear that gripped the people of Ephesus.

221
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,320
 They have such reference for the name of Jesus Christ.

222
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,320
 It was recorded in Acts 19, "When this became known to the Jews and great living Ephesus,

223
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:58,600
 they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high esteem."

224
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,660
 In this way, the Word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.

225
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:10,840
 The city of Ephesus and its culture was literally transformed by Paul's ministry.

226
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:17,120
 And most of all, the Word of God spread throughout Asia Minor, which was the key commercial route

227
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,080
 linking the eastern and the western part of the Roman Empire.

228
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:28,120
 Well, we almost yearned for the same kind of impactful ministry here in Hong Kong to

229
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,000
 be replicated.

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,800
 After the famous riots in Ephesus, God set His heart to preach all the way to Rome, and

231
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:44,160
 by now, He would travel out to Macedonia and Greece to collect love offerings for the Judean

232
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
 church.

233
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:53,440
 While He was departing Greece, the Jews made up a plot so Paul has to make a deroute.

234
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,200
 He has to pass by Ephesus, and therefore, he could only call upon the elders to say

235
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,280
 a final farewell.

236
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:08,280
 Church, let's appreciate the power in this old Paul.

237
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,880
 And the power really comes from the very personal and intimate relationship between Paul and

238
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
 his beloved church.

239
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,600
 Acts 20, "When they arrived, he said to them, 'You know how I lived the whole time I was

240
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,140
 with you.

241
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:33,680
 On the first day I came to the province of Asia, I served with great humility and with

242
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:41,000
 tears in the midst of severe testing by the flaws of my Jewish opponents.

243
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 You know I have not hesitated to preach anything that will be helpful to you.'"

244
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,560
 Paul has three main themes to cover.

245
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,200
 He's presenting himself as an example for the Ephesian elders.

246
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,560
 He presents to them a charge and a warning.

247
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,760
 And finally, how he commits them to God.

248
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,720
 Obviously, the most prominent theme of Paul would be his own example.

249
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,720
 He was an example as he identified with the people.

250
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,960
 He lived amongst them.

251
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:19,120
 He served God with humility and tears, and he went from house to house to preach.

252
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,040
 Indeed, he served the God with great humility and with tears.

253
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,880
 And it is here that we have a glimpse into the very tender side of Paul.

254
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,720
 While we must know that humility is not a virtue readily embraced by the Roman culture,

255
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:44,760
 rather it was often thought to be a representation, a sign of weakness for the individual.

256
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:52,680
 Yet Paul seeks to embody a servant leader model that he learns from the Lord Jesus.

257
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,680
 While in my previous church in Singapore, the parking lot is about seven minutes from

258
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,400
 the church premise.

259
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,920
 And in order to pamper the congregants, show that they do not have to walk under the hot

260
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,880
 sun, we actually arranged for a pickup van for them.

261
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,440
 While the interesting thing is the drive itself takes five minutes.

262
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,960
 Anyway, I volunteer to be one of the driver, and it is through such serving that you know

263
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,920
 sometimes there are many things that was done in this church, in that church, that was not

264
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
 appreciated.

265
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:36,480
 Anyway, we, the volunteers do double up as traffic marshals, and as we directed the traffic

266
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,320
 in a double-parked, fully-packed car park, we received scolding, left and right, from

267
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,360
 none other than the congregants.

268
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:56,640
 But that's where we learn humility, while we served in low positions.

269
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,760
 Paul sets yet another example.

270
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,600
 He obeyed, he obeyed despite his sufferings.

271
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,720
 While there seems to be two conflicting work of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit compelled

272
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,480
 Paul to travel to Jerusalem.

273
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,320
 Yet at the same time, he gave much warnings about his possible sufferings.

274
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,440
 But Paul's commitment to Christ helps him reconcile the seeming contradiction.

275
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:34,800
 Even if such faithfulness involves suffering and imprisonment, he's willing to obey.

276
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,600
 Compelled by the Spirit, I'm going to Jerusalem.

277
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:47,160
 Paul uses the image of being chained, tied up like a prisoner, in this instance, by the

278
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,480
 Holy Spirit.

279
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,240
 This same word, compelled, is also translated as bound.

280
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,760
 It's used to describe Paul's binding in chains when he subsequently was indeed taken into

281
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,600
 custody by the Romans in Jerusalem.

282
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:14,400
 The metaphor underlines Paul's conviction that indeed this is a divine imperative, bound

283
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
 by the Spirit.

284
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,760
 Yet we also record how Paul reflected on his ministry.

285
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,680
 Despite his being bind in chains, he was actually able to advise the gospel all the way to the

286
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,000
 royal court in Rome.

287
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,240
 And this gospel continues to spread despite his imprisonment.

288
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,640
 As for Paul, in every city, the Holy Spirit warns him.

289
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:51,040
 Even after his farewell in Ephesus, along the way to Jerusalem, people in Tyre warned

290
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,760
 of the same fate awaiting him.

291
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:05,920
 The Judean prophet Agabus also warned Paul that he will be bound and arrested as he travels

292
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,440
 to Jerusalem.

293
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,600
 But he considered his life worth nothing.

294
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,000
 His only aim is to finish the race and complete the task that Lord Jesus Christ has given

295
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,040
 him, the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace.

296
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,000
 Paul remained bound to Christ.

297
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,600
 What does binding mean for us?

298
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:37,040
 So some years back, I signed up for a venture skydiving in New Zealand.

299
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:45,320
 After a really sleepless night, I checked into the venue, and by the time we were bound,

300
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:53,480
 strapped in tandem to the instructor, and the plane began to ascend, there's no chance

301
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,040
 to check him out.

302
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,760
 But indeed, throughout the ascent, I frantically checked that I'm really tightly bound to my

303
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,400
 instructor.

304
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:11,200
 But then there's some whisper between the instructors, "Oh, we made a mistake."

305
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,200
 "Wow, what mistake?"

306
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,360
 "Well, we find out that we signed up for 12,000 feet jump off.

307
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,760
 But they mixed it up.

308
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,680
 Now we are to jump off 15,000 feet."

309
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,960
 "Well, it's a bonus.

310
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,520
 It's a free upgrade."

311
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,640
 "Well, the thing is, while it may not have too much difference, well, the real difference

312
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,000
 is the time of the free fall.

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,480
 You free fall longer before the parachute opens up around 3,000 feet.

314
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,480
 But there would not be any difference as long as the parachute opens up and you are tightly

315
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
 bound."

316
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:03,040
 Well, this is a leap of faith, and I'm eternally grateful that I was indeed tightly bound really

317
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
 well.

318
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:13,000
 Well, the thing is, are we tightly bound to Christ?

319
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,960
 Sometimes in our different seasons in life, we almost felt that we were free fall.

320
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,460
 We just dropped.

321
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,920
 We just fall.

322
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,360
 But there we are.

323
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,520
 Are we bound tightly to Jesus?

324
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,640
 Do you take courage from your relationship with Him that in these challenging times,

325
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,840
 you can fully entrust in Him?

326
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:45,040
 Sometimes fear comes into our lives, especially when we fail to be bound tightly to Christ.

327
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:51,520
 But if any one of us is feeling that sense of fear, check to see how your relationship

328
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
 with Jesus is.

329
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,600
 He will catch you always, even as you fall, but stay bound to Him.

330
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,800
 Paul exclaims, "What then is my reward?

331
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,960
 Just this, that in preaching the gospel, I may offer it free.

332
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,920
 I do this, all of this, for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings."

333
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:24,200
 In other words, Paul is telling us the cause of the gospel is so great that any price is

334
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,920
 worth paying in order to advance it.

335
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,000
 Are we willing to pay that price?

336
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,440
 Indeed, Paul issued a warning and a charge for his elders.

337
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,460
 He's fully aware that after his departure, things could go very wrong in Ephesus Church.

338
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,680
 So most importantly, the elders are to watch out for themselves.

339
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:55,200
 And of course, they must also watch over and shepherd the flock.

340
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,620
 The concept of a flock of sheep as an image of the community of God's people is well-rooted

341
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,040
 in the Old Testament.

342
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:10,980
 In the book of Ezekiel, the shepherds have been so concerned about feeding themselves

343
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,520
 that their sheep went astray.

344
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,040
 They were not well-fed.

345
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:22,760
 They have roamed the hillsides to unprotected areas and have become prey for the wild animals.

346
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:30,440
 And that's where, in this very dreadful situation, God himself took up to become the shepherd

347
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,240
 for his sheep.

348
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:39,140
 That beautiful role of being the shepherd, the pastor of his people is beautifully expressed

349
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,200
 in Psalm 23.

350
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,320
 Now fast forward to New Testament.

351
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,400
 Of course, we know that Jesus becomes our good shepherd.

352
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:57,920
 Then Peter, as a representative of all Christian leaders, is three times entrusted by Jesus,

353
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,240
 "Take care of my sheep.

354
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,760
 Take care of my sheep.

355
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,080
 Take care of my sheep."

356
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:11,400
 And now here, Paul reminded the leaders must shepherd the flock.

357
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,840
 So Paul himself is working as a tent maker in Ephesus.

358
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,760
 Well, this allowed him to live amongst the people in the city where many just travel

359
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,120
 in and travel out.

360
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,720
 Literally, he come across people from all walks of life from throughout the Roman Empire.

361
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:37,320
 And often people come to him or his shop to receive his service and ministry.

362
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,120
 In his workplace, he probably reached out to more people than he managed in the synagogue

363
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,680
 and the hall where he preached.

364
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,200
 Paul set out the example of living amongst people.

365
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,540
 We may say that, well, he's a double agent.

366
00:25:53,540 --> 00:26:00,800
 He works to support himself in the ministry during the day and he pastor whenever in between.

367
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,600
 But for us, we can all likewise follow his example.

368
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,560
 Yes, we do have a daytime job, but we can be the double agents.

369
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,600
 Indeed, we should embrace our shepherd role.

370
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,200
 God has entrusted someone under our care, someone for us to look out for.

371
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:27,400
 Well, of course, the challenge for modern day believers is real, very real.

372
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:33,480
 We are so used to forfeiting our pastoral roles to the pastors.

373
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,800
 True, not all of us are pastors or elders or leaders by title, but we are all endowed

374
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,480
 with that responsibility, that noble task to look out for others.

375
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:52,680
 The very one sitting just right next to you, that very role of a shepherd to look out to

376
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,120
 pastor his flock.

377
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:02,120
 Now your flock could be your staff while you're a boss, while you're a middle management,

378
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,200
 a team leader, a teacher, a manager.

379
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,340
 Your flock could be your household.

380
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,680
 Come on, husbands, look after your household.

381
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,000
 Shepherd your flock, your spouse, your children.

382
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,920
 Your flock could also be your small group members, your ministry co-leaders.

383
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:30,160
 Wherever God places us, we are duty bound to watch out for each other.

384
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:37,320
 I'm tremendously blessed as the nature of my work allow me to reach out to people from

385
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,000
 all different countries who come and visit me.

386
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,040
 Not long ago, I had that privilege to pray for a couple who came from a real far away

387
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,560
 country that I never had a chance to travel to.

388
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,920
 But I'm more blessed than they are, even as they go through some of those toughest moments

389
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,800
 in life, but I can journey on with them.

390
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:07,880
 I have fond memories of another lady under my care in my clinical practice and her lovely

391
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,340
 children.

392
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:15,520
 We became good friends as she had a very prolonged stay in the hospital.

393
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:23,160
 Then we, including my wife and the small group, were able to reach out to her, to befriend

394
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:30,960
 her, to invite her to celebrate her birthday outside of the hospital, and to share Jesus

395
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,240
 with her.

396
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:41,120
 And we were also privileged to stand alongside her family when we bid her final farewell

397
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,920
 during her funeral.

398
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,480
 We teared, and yet we are comforted.

399
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,160
 On quite a few subsequent Chinese New Years, her children would continue to call us and

400
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,520
 send us their greetings.

401
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:08,320
 I'm confident that by now they have grown up to become young men, young women of stature,

402
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,000
 because ultimately it is Christ who watch over them.

403
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,760
 But we have that honor to partner with Christ to watch over them.

404
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,800
 While many of you in the audience is aware that I'm serving as an elder in this church,

405
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,920
 what a noble task and yet awesome responsibility.

406
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,320
 Yet you may wonder what elders really do in this church.

407
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,000
 Well very briefly, we are elected by the congregation for a three-year term.

408
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,480
 We can be re-elected for another term, a total, a max of six years, with occasional exceptions.

409
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,380
 So we're here to help shoulder the spiritual leadership of the church.

410
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:58,480
 We are to discern and advise on critical matters, both spiritual and strategic.

411
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,400
 Example the church plant.

412
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:07,540
 We carry the responsibility of corporate governance, including financial well-being of the church,

413
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,360
 as well as legal responsibilities in the secular sphere.

414
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,840
 But most of all, we also are there to watch out for the congregation.

415
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,120
 Over the past six years, we have witnessed some of the most phenomenal growth of this

416
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
 church.

417
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,940
 Then of course, we also see the challenge of the social movements and the seemingly

418
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,960
 never-ending COVID-19.

419
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,560
 But you can be best assured, and you have probably experienced, how the pastoral team

420
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,760
 has stayed committed to watch out for you.

421
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,560
 Now fellow elders and I are rightfully not in the forefront of ministry, but we share

422
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,800
 that burden of spiritual overseeing to look out for the flock.

423
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:05,160
 Personally, I do often find pause, charge, and warning too much to bear.

424
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,600
 How are we able to shepherd the flock when sometimes we don't even know our flock?

425
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,720
 There was a real challenge when our church grew so fast a few years ago.

426
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,720
 Now we have another challenge when we have so much dynamic movements in and out of the

427
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
 flock.

428
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,000
 We hardly recognize your faces behind the masks.

429
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,300
 But I find my comfort and reassurance that it may not be most important that we know

430
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,100
 you in person or vice versa.

431
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:44,360
 It is only important that you are known by our chief shepherd, Lord Jesus Christ, and

432
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,880
 that you continue to hear His voice.

433
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,800
 But for as long as you are part of this faith community, our commitment remains that we

434
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,960
 shall watch over you.

435
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:05,520
 Apostle Peter likewise encouraged all of us, "Tend the flock, not as compelled to do, but

436
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:13,280
 willingly, not for gain, but eagerly be examples."

437
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,520
 Some 14 years ago, we relocated back to Hong Kong, and someone looked out for us here in

438
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,240
 this church.

439
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,440
 Now church, think of yourself as a pastor, a shepherd.

440
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,080
 Each and every one of us can look out for someone in our midst, in our own sphere of

441
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,440
 influence.

442
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,520
 Paul concludes his speech by once more presenting the challenge of his own life as an example

443
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,040
 for the others to follow.

444
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,640
 While he was with them, he showed sincere commitment.

445
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,960
 He did not convert what others had.

446
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,520
 Rather, he worked hard with his own hands to provide for the needs of his team.

447
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:03,200
 And in the process of earning money, he also helped those who are in need.

448
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,680
 We must help the weak.

449
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:12,320
 Diversity with money, with food, with material possessions is indeed a hallmark of the early

450
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,320
 church.

451
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,760
 And it is a virtue that Paul empowers his congregation to practice.

452
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,240
 Remembering the words the Lord Jesus Christ said, "It is more blessed to give than to

453
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:34,280
 receive," we must understand there is this principle of reciprocity, which is deeply

454
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,360
 ingrained in the Greek culture.

455
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,880
 That is, one must give in equal measure to what one has received.

456
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,840
 Paul's exhortation strikes out this idea.

457
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,800
 Instead, he encouraged believers to give to those who cannot give in return.

458
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:02,920
 In the book of Acts, in fact, Luke describes how in the church there was no needy person,

459
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:10,160
 which itself looks back to the law of Moses, which commanded that the confident community,

460
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,640
 there should be no persons in need.

461
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:21,160
 Herein, Paul encouraged his communities to look out for the poor in their midst.

462
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:28,080
 The church now should think of herself as the vanguard of a renewed Israel community,

463
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:33,800
 an ideal community where no one was to be left to cope alone.

464
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:41,240
 And even as he was persecuted by his own people, Paul cared for those in need, including those

465
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,240
 in Judea, to support them during the famine.

466
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:52,720
 Ultimately, our giving of money, of our life, and of ourselves should be a reflection of

467
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:59,040
 what we learned from our Lord Jesus Christ as he gave of himself.

468
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,560
 You're familiar with the generosity of our master, Jesus Christ.

469
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,720
 Rich as he was, he gave it all away for us.

470
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:14,240
 In one stroke, he became poor and we became rich.

471
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,680
 So a quick summary of what a Christian expression should be like.

472
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,640
 There should be binding to the Holy Spirit.

473
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,920
 We are to serve, to watch out for others, and we are to give.

474
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:35,120
 As we bind ourselves to Christ, we experience his love to serve others with great love,

475
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,200
 being generous in the giving of ourselves.

476
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:46,120
 And sometimes when our love bank got depleted, our binding to Christ filled us up once again,

477
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,560
 so the cycle can continue.

478
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:58,280
 Now while there's much encouragement from Paul, after all, a farewell is a farewell.

479
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:05,280
 It is in fact heartbreaking to have Paul bring this up again in his farewell speech, that

480
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,160
 they would never see his face again.

481
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:17,040
 Now even in modern days, we face that kind of dilemma when we think of legacy that we

482
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,520
 may leave behind.

483
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,440
 And we are one day no longer in this land of living.

484
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,760
 On that note, we really need to know two things.

485
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,840
 That all our stuff is not ours.

486
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,680
 And number two, in all our stuff, it's not us.

487
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,760
 We are not defined by what we have.

488
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:47,160
 Life indeed is not defined by what we have, even when we have a lot.

489
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,120
 I recall the very first time that I had the privilege to sit down with Pastor Andrew for

490
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,960
 lunch, that was some six or seven years ago.

491
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,760
 I guess he was interviewing me to see whether I'm fit to be considered to become an elder

492
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,480
 in the vine.

493
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,440
 So I came up with this model answer.

494
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:15,480
 I came to a season of my life that I realized is much more important for me to give than

495
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,200
 to receive.

496
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,920
 Well it is not a matter of whether I had enough materially at that time.

497
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:33,000
 It is just a realization that I'm left with so little chances and time to give of myself.

498
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,640
 In fact my favorite story that I shared with one of my very rich patients was a parable

499
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:46,320
 of the rich man who built yet another vine to store even more.

500
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,960
 While he was to go through a minor surgery under light anesthesia, but he went into a

501
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,440
 somewhat confused state.

502
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:02,920
 He was so scared, so fearful as if he was running for his life.

503
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,440
 So after the incident, it opened up an opportunity whereby I can reach out to him to care for

504
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:14,320
 him, and to introduce this story of the real rich man.

505
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:21,840
 But God said to him, "You fool, this very night your life will be demanded from you.

506
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,460
 Then you will get what you have prepared for yourself.

507
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,920
 This is how it will be for whoever stores up things for themselves, but is not rich

508
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,200
 towards God."

509
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,760
 I do want to share something more about Farewell before we finish for the day.

510
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,440
 Over 35 years of clinical practice, I had encountered more deaths than probably most

511
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,040
 of you in the audience.

512
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:59,200
 I find that some departed well prepared, but many others did not.

513
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:10,920
 However, when it became evidence to me that I myself am facing a finite future for myself

514
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:23,120
 upon diagnosis of blood cancer, I decided to do a good farewell, a joyous one.

515
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:31,040
 I invited different people because I wanted to thank the many people who have poured into

516
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,600
 my life.

517
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:41,840
 I wanted to appreciate all those who journeyed with us through thick and thin.

518
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:52,880
 I want to encourage all our spiritual sons and daughters that we have shared our life.

519
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:04,680
 With that, they may carry on with steadfast trust in God regardless.

520
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:12,360
 And I wanted to share my faith with friends and beloved ones whom have as yet to know

521
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
 Jesus.

522
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:21,360
 So, in no other places than this auditorium right here, we hosted our anniversary banquet.

523
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:29,280
 A good excuse whereby we are to share our 21st wedding anniversary and we are also there

524
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,760
 to celebrate life.

525
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:41,360
 But deep in me, there was this sense of farewell and hopefully it is said well ahead of time.

526
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:48,520
 Our anniversary wish was that we might be able to celebrate yet another 25 years of

527
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,240
 marriage.

528
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,520
 But we had indeed celebrated our 30th anniversary not long ago.

529
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,160
 And we are still eagerly looking forward to spending time together.

530
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,040
 Living is about giving.

531
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:14,340
 And my desire is that I may continue to give and to give of myself.

532
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:20,160
 In Paul's word, he's pouring his life like a drink offering.

533
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,720
 Indeed, I'm already poured out like a drink offering.

534
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:35,520
 Now, church tradition was such that Paul was released after his arrest in Jerusalem and

535
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,960
 imprisonment in Rome.

536
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,920
 He was able to revisit many of his churches and his friends upon the release.

537
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,960
 So somehow, a final farewell might not be final.

538
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:59,080
 But that would be God's extra grace and as recipients of his grace, we just need to be

539
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:07,440
 reminded once again, to give is more blessed than to receive.

540
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,240
 And living is about giving.

541
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,800
 I want to invite all of us to stand.

542
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:24,160
 I've shared this message to encourage all of us to look out for someone else.

543
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,580
 There must be someone that you can look out for, that you can shepherd.

544
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:38,800
 So I want to invite all of us to look out for someone standing next to you.

545
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,680
 To pray with him for whatever challenges, for whatever free fall that he's experiencing,

546
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,280
 but you are there to look out for him.

547
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,600
 And likewise, he will pray for you.

548
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:59,360
 It's important time that we practice serving and loving by praying with each other.

549
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:08,040
 So pair up with someone that you don't quite know and pray with him, with her, that God

550
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:15,880
 will continue to watch over, that he or she will be binded by the Holy Spirit, will be

551
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,480
 binded to Christ, that they will be able to serve and to love others.

552
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,640
 Take your time, pray with each other, commit to each other.
