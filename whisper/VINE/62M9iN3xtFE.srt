1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Amazing Grace was originally written by John Newton

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,720
 to actually illustrate a sermon that he was preaching

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,340
 on New Year's Day of 1773.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,000
 And this has become perhaps one of the most famous hymns

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,240
 that has ever been written,

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,440
 one that's sung and celebrated in both Christian

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,660
 and secular context alike.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,680
 And it's a song where the words have deep meaning

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,420
 and resonance to Newton himself.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,400
 Newton did not grow up a Christian,

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,640
 but his life had so many ups and downs

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,160
 that it eventually brought him to a profound understanding

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,520
 of the work of grace in his own life.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,440
 At a young age, Newton was conscripted into the Royal Navy

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,140
 in those days in the Great Britain and the colonies.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,240
 And he spent the majority of his young life

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,200
 to about middle age serving in the Royal Navy.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,600
 But he eventually was let out of the Navy

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,940
 and for the decades beyond that,

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,940
 Newton was one of the leaders of the Atlantic slave trade.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,540
 He was actually perhaps one of the most prosperous

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,100
 and successful slave trade merchants

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,600
 in the Atlantic Ocean in those days,

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,480
 using all the knowledge and skill that he had gained

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,000
 from being in the Royal Navy to now partaking

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,900
 in the absolute injustice of the trade of human flesh.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,500
 In 1748, his slave vessel was just off the coast of Ireland

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,980
 and a massive storm ripped up.

29
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,540
 One of those storms where everybody on board the ship

30
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,940
 thought that they were going to die.

31
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,180
 And as the story happens and goes,

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,500
 Newton was standing on the deck of the ship

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,340
 and he looked out at the storm thinking he was about to die

34
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,220
 and cries out for God to have mercy on him.

35
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,140
 The storm apparently subsides

36
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,420
 and the vessel was able to make it into the port.

37
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,980
 And that was the spiritual conversion moment for Newton.

38
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,900
 From that point onwards, he gave his life to Christ Jesus,

39
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,060
 a life that would eventually lead him

40
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,180
 to actually being a vicar in the Church of England,

41
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,700
 hence the sermon on New Year's Day in 1773.

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,020
 But there's something that's a little less known

43
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,580
 about Newton.

44
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,220
 That after that, a moment in 1748,

45
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,380
 where he had his conversion to Jesus

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,380
 for the next 10 years, Newton was still a slave trader.

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,180
 Think about that for a second.

48
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,060
 On the one side, professing Jesus Christ

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,180
 as his Lord and Savior,

50
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,980
 and on the other side, still involved in the profit

51
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,620
 of the trade of human flesh.

52
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,380
 And we know that towards the end of his life,

53
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,660
 he was beginning to wrestle with the ills

54
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,300
 and the sins of his past.

55
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,060
 And so he writes this hymn,

56
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,920
 and he says these profound words,

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,460
 "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound

58
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,380
 "that saved a wretch like me."

59
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,180
 Wretched indeed.

60
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,660
 One who had been involved in one of the most wretched

61
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,020
 practices of all of human history.

62
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,260
 One who understood that if God's grace

63
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,780
 could be extended to him, that was truly amazing grace.

64
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,140
 One who realized that out of the depth

65
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,580
 of the brokenness and the injustice of his past,

66
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,460
 he was now able to sing a song of truly amazing grace.

67
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,240
 I mean, grace really is amazing, isn't it?

68
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,380
 Well, yes and no.

69
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,380
 Because it wouldn't be until May 1st, 1807,

70
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,980
 that the slave trade was legally abolished

71
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,740
 in Great Britain and the colonies.

72
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,400
 And I want you to imagine what it would have been like

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,020
 to have been a freed slave in that time.

74
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,780
 By 1807, "Amazing Grace" was a song,

75
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,700
 a hymn that was being sung in the churches

76
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,380
 of the colonies all around.

77
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,500
 Imagine for a moment,

78
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,900
 if you were one of the freed slaves in 1807,

79
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,940
 standing in a congregation in the colonies

80
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,820
 that was largely white, and this hymn starts to be sung.

81
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,700
 I wonder if you could imagine how hard it must have been

82
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,340
 for that freed slave to sing that song.

83
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,580
 To be willing to stand amongst all the white people

84
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,580
 around them and sing a song written by a slave trader.

85
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,940
 An ex-slave trader, perhaps,

86
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,180
 but a slave trader none the self.

87
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,860
 One who had for many years profited off of the misery

88
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,620
 and the slavery of their own people.

89
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,020
 I think there may have been a little bitterness on the tongue

90
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,300
 of the one singing about a grace for that one.

91
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,520
 And the question arises for us, I think, quite profoundly.

92
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,420
 Is it possible to sing the song of the oppressor,

93
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,820
 even if the oppressor shows remorse?

94
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,580
 Is grace actually that amazing?

95
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,820
 That's the question I want you to hold in your mind

96
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,540
 and in your spirit as we step into looking

97
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,660
 at the third song of Advent that we're doing today.

98
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,220
 We've looked at Mary's song,

99
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,380
 this song of a hope for those that are oppressed,

100
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,180
 a song that cries out and says that God is able

101
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,700
 to bring down the rulers and raise up the humble,

102
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,860
 send the rich away empty, but feed the starving.

103
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,740
 And then last week we saw a song of Zechariah,

104
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,380
 a song for the rest, for the weary,

105
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,220
 those that are tired, those that are worn out,

106
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,540
 those that are hoping that a Messiah would come

107
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,460
 to set them free and give them that peace and security

108
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,060
 for all eternity, that there's a song

109
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,620
 for the rest, for the weary.

110
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,580
 Well, this week and next week,

111
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,780
 we turn to looking at two songs in our Christmas story

112
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,420
 in scripture that happened after the birth of Jesus,

113
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,060
 Mary and Zechariah leading up to the birth,

114
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,420
 and now Simeon this week and next week,

115
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,660
 the angels singing a song after the birth of Jesus,

116
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,900
 a song that celebrates the reality of what's happening

117
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,740
 and importantly speaks of the themes

118
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,440
 of what this Jesus is actually going to do.

119
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,100
 And in the song that we're gonna look at today,

120
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,660
 Simeon, a prophet in the temple,

121
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,100
 brings a song that declares the work

122
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,780
 that Jesus will do in his kingdom

123
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,900
 through his life, death, and his resurrection.

124
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,900
 But it's a song that many in Israel

125
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,740
 were not yet ready to sing.

126
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,300
 Let me read this to you.

127
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,900
 It's from Luke chapter two, starting in verse 21,

128
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,380
 and we're gonna go 21 through to 32.

129
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,580
 On the eighth day, this is the eighth day

130
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,900
 after Jesus' birth, when it was time to circumcise him,

131
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
 he was named Jesus.

132
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,400
 The name the angel had given him

133
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,580
 before he had been conceived.

134
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,680
 Now, when the time for their purification

135
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,740
 according to the Lord of Moses had been completed,

136
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,720
 Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem

137
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,900
 to present him to the Lord,

138
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,940
 as it is written in the law of the Lord.

139
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,500
 Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord,

140
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,060
 and to offer there a sacrifice in keeping

141
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,860
 with what is said in the law of the Lord,

142
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,700
 a pair of doves or two young pigeons.

143
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,240
 Now, there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon,

144
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,420
 who was righteous and devout.

145
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,220
 He was waiting for the consolation of Israel,

146
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,640
 and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

147
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,820
 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit

148
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,060
 that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

149
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,900
 So now moved by the Spirit,

150
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,380
 he went into the temple courts.

151
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,420
 And when the parents brought in the child Jesus

152
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,900
 to do for him what was custom of the law and required,

153
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,900
 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God saying this,

154
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,940
 "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,

155
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,540
 you may now dismiss your servant in peace.

156
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,580
 For my eyes have seen your salvation,

157
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,980
 which you have prepared in the sight of all people,

158
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,900
 a light for revelation to the Gentiles,

159
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,440
 and for glory to your people, Israel."

160
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,980
 Luke is a master storyteller,

161
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,260
 and this is his last story about the birth of Jesus.

162
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,120
 It's the last Advent Christmas story

163
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,500
 that we have in scripture.

164
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,980
 And to put this story as vividly as he can for the reader,

165
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,940
 he pulls together some of the most important aspects

166
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,260
 of what Jewish religious life was like in those days.

167
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,260
 He speaks of a temple, circumcision, dedication,

168
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,180
 offerings, and a song.

169
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,220
 The very things that summarize perhaps

170
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,980
 how the Jews were to faithfully worship in those days.

171
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,020
 And he paints a picture of Mary and Joseph

172
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,140
 once again being this faithful Jewish couple.

173
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,980
 Everything he mentions here, Mary and Joseph do

174
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,780
 out of their faithful obedience to the law of Moses

175
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,900
 on the eighth day, they take Jesus

176
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,020
 and they give him his name as the angel Gabriel had said.

177
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,500
 They circumcise him as was right to do

178
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,180
 for that firstborn male.

179
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,420
 They then bring him 40 days later.

180
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,520
 So this is about day 48 of Jesus's life.

181
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,920
 They bring him to the temple.

182
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,580
 Now, just for a second,

183
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,800
 imagine what that would have been like.

184
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,700
 This is the very first time that Jesus, the Messiah,

185
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,420
 is brought into the temple.

186
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,460
 The temple representing the house of God,

187
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,140
 the temple being the very place

188
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,700
 where the spirit of God dwelled.

189
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,140
 I mean, for God, this must have been

190
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,940
 one of the most significant,

191
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,900
 most exciting moments of all creation.

192
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,260
 Finally, Jesus in God's house.

193
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,500
 Mary and Joseph have really no full concept

194
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
 of what they're doing.

195
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,620
 All they're doing is remaining faithful

196
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,540
 to what was required of them.

197
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,620
 On that 48th day, they come themselves

198
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,680
 and they were to do three things.

199
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,820
 First of all, purify themselves in a ritual of sacrifice.

200
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,580
 In order to do that, they were supposed to bring

201
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,900
 either a lamb or a dove if you have a lot of money,

202
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,260
 or if you are poorer, like Mary and Joseph,

203
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,600
 you were to bring two pigeons.

204
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,540
 These would be sacrificed to offer purification

205
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,420
 for you as the parents.

206
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,740
 After that, you were then to present your child

207
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,620
 to the temple.

208
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,420
 Present your child essentially to Yahweh, to God,

209
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,200
 and then to dedicate the child.

210
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
 Now, this is really important.

211
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,300
 Dedicate the child for service

212
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,580
 for the rest of their life to the Lord.

213
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,820
 I think this is brilliant because Mary and Joseph

214
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,020
 are just doing what's told for them to do.

215
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,600
 They're being obedient to the law,

216
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,900
 but they're about to dedicate the Messiah

217
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,940
 to the service of his father,

218
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,540
 to do all the things that God has on his heart to do

219
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,860
 in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus,

220
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,220
 and the redemption of all history.

221
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,420
 All of that is in front of them and they have no idea.

222
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,100
 And so as they bring this child in,

223
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,100
 Simeon, a prophet, old, old prophet in the temple,

224
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,500
 is so filled with the Holy Spirit

225
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,620
 that something unbelievable takes place.

226
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,200
 And I want you to see what's happening here.

227
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,300
 Mary and Joseph, very ordinary, very normal,

228
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,620
 are suddenly about to come into contact

229
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,940
 with God stepping into their mundane and normal.

230
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,300
 We need to understand that out of the ordinary,

231
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,840
 God brings his extraordinary.

232
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,560
 This is the way of God.

233
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,860
 This is what the Christmas Advent story in scripture

234
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,960
 has been pointed towards,

235
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,060
 the fact that the Messiah, born in the ordinariest

236
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,740
 of a stable, something extraordinary into the world,

237
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,980
 all the angels in front of the shepherds,

238
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,580
 ordinary shepherds going about their normal day,

239
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,740
 the extraordinary of God breaking into that mundane,

240
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,900
 and yet again, right in this moment.

241
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,100
 And what Luke's trying to tell the reader

242
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,380
 is something really simple,

243
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,460
 that it's in our normal, everyday lives

244
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,320
 that God often comes and changes them for his extraordinary.

245
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
 And I think that's a real encouragement

246
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
 for each person in this room.

247
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,820
 I mean, I don't know what's exactly going on

248
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,740
 in your life right now.

249
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,100
 I don't know what the ups and downs might be,

250
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,360
 but I do know the year we've all lived before.

251
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,540
 And I know that it can often feel

252
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,000
 like it's overwhelming for us

253
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,540
 in terms of the mundaneness of life, the justice.

254
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,460
 Hey, I've been coming to church every Sunday,

255
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,240
 and I do that, and I've got all these things.

256
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,680
 And just like Susanna was praying,

257
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,420
 all this prayer and stuff that I've been holding in my heart

258
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,900
 and I don't know what's gonna happen.

259
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,380
 But what Luke is trying to say is this,

260
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,060
 the call of the people of God

261
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,820
 is not to the extraordinary, it's to the ordinary.

262
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,260
 We are the ones who are called just to be faithful,

263
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,140
 as Mary and Joseph were, to the law, to the things,

264
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,820
 to the obedience of God, knowing that it's our ordinary

265
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,100
 that gets invaded by God's extraordinary.

266
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,460
 You don't need to be the greatest miracle worker.

267
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,380
 That's actually God's job.

268
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,900
 You don't need to have all the answers of everything.

269
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,120
 That's actually God's prerogative.

270
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,700
 What you're called to is simply faithfulness.

271
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,180
 The beautiful, wonderful faithfulness of obedience to God

272
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,680
 in the best way that you can,

273
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,900
 even in the brokenness that we all have,

274
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,940
 trying to be just faithful,

275
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,060
 and the reality of that, God steps in.

276
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,260
 Mary and Joseph step into the temple

277
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,420
 in the ordinariness of obeying the law of Moses.

278
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,860
 God breaks in with the extraordinary

279
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,220
 and does something that changes all of history.

280
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,540
 You're about to step into the ordinary of your 2022.

281
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,620
 And I wonder where your expectation sits.

282
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,980
 Does it sit with this,

283
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,500
 oh, I don't really know what that year is gonna be about?

284
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,460
 Or is there something beginning to rise in your spirit

285
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,460
 that says, as I step into what might appear

286
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,860
 like the ordinary of 2022,

287
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,700
 I might have a heart that would expect the extraordinary

288
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,340
 of what God might want to do.

289
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,940
 Are you with me?

290
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,260
 So Luke's trying to open up this idea

291
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,180
 of what faithfulness looks like.

292
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,820
 And then he shifts the spotlight

293
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,020
 from the faithfulness of Mary and Joseph

294
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,100
 to the faithfulness of Simeon, this old prophet.

295
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,860
 Let me read to you just a couple of verses

296
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,860
 of how Luke describes Simeon in verse 25.

297
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,420
 Now, there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon

298
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,860
 who was righteous and devout.

299
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,820
 He was waiting for the consolation of Israel

300
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,940
 and the Holy Spirit was upon him,

301
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,380
 for it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit

302
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,580
 that he would not die before he had seen the Lord Jesus.

303
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,020
 Now, this is awesome.

304
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,420
 Here's a man who has been given by the Spirit of God

305
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,900
 a word over his life, a calling over his life.

306
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,140
 And Luke describes him as righteous and devout.

307
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,220
 I mean, if Mary and Joseph were like this beautiful picture

308
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,580
 of faithful Jewish people,

309
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,100
 here's the picture of a faithful religious man,

310
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,220
 a faithful prophet who's righteous and devout.

311
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,340
 And God has said that he is waiting,

312
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,780
 longing for the consolation of Israel.

313
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,900
 What he wants, in other words, is for Israel to rise up,

314
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,140
 for Israel to receive the glory and the goodness

315
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,180
 that God has for it,

316
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,860
 that Israel would be established once again

317
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,780
 to live freely in their land,

318
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,940
 the consolation of all that Israel had meant for.

319
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,260
 This man is holding that passion in his heart.

320
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,980
 And not only that, but at some point,

321
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,220
 God has come to him and said this,

322
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,740
 "Hey, Simeon, this is really awesome.

323
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,100
 "Check this out.

324
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,340
 "You're not gonna die until you've seen the Messiah."

325
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,580
 Can you imagine how exciting that would have been?

326
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,500
 Says Simeon, "I'm going to see the Messiah."

327
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,220
 Now, he probably got that word when he was in his 40s.

328
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,660
 And you can imagine it, right?

329
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,980
 Every single day, today could be the day

330
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,780
 where I will see the Messiah.

331
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,620
 And then he'd get to the end of the day and he'd be like,

332
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,780
 "Okay, it wasn't today."

333
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,740
 And then he got up the next day,

334
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,980
 "Today might be the day that I get to see the Messiah."

335
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,780
 And then he goes to bed that night going,

336
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,660
 "It wasn't this day."

337
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,780
 And now here he is,

338
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,260
 and the Bible is describing him as very, very old.

339
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,460
 And it's like he's sort of saying,

340
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,820
 "Gee, God, I want to die.

341
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,400
 "Like I'm really old now, right?

342
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,400
 "Could today please be the day that I see the Messiah?

343
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,120
 "'Cause that would be really good for me and my family.

344
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,200
 "And for all of Israel, yes,

345
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,700
 "but for me too, particularly, I want to go home."

346
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,180
 So here he is on this day.

347
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,420
 On the ordinary mundaneness of this day.

348
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,100
 And the Bible says something really important.

349
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,660
 It says this in verse 27.

350
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,740
 It says, "Moved by the Spirit,

351
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,540
 "he went into the temple courts.

352
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,100
 "And when the parents brought the child Jesus in

353
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,380
 "to do what was just ordinary, mundane,

354
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,540
 "the custom, the law required,

355
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,860
 "Simeon takes him in his arms."

356
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,540
 Now, this is nuts.

357
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,640
 Could you imagine this moment?

358
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,940
 The temple court is a busy public space.

359
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,340
 It's not the inner courts that were more private.

360
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,820
 The outer court, the temple courts were busy.

361
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,140
 And that was where you could buy your sacrifices

362
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,980
 and everything.

363
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,620
 It was loud and noisy and all of this.

364
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,100
 And here's Mary and Joseph.

365
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,740
 And they've just walked up the steps of the temple.

366
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,220
 They've entered under the archways into the outer courts.

367
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,460
 They're holding Jesus.

368
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,300
 And you can imagine,

369
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,920
 they are overwhelmed by the cacophony of noise

370
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,760
 and everything.

371
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,700
 This is an overwhelming moment.

372
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,340
 And not only that, but here's the old man, Simeon,

373
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,940
 who's wondering is today the day,

374
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,100
 who's filled suddenly with the Holy Spirit.

375
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,300
 And he sees this young couple

376
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,220
 and he walks intently towards them,

377
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,540
 as if, I'm just gonna pretend you're Mary and Joseph, okay?

378
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,660
 Don't freak out, it's true.

379
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,740
 But he walks intently towards them.

380
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,060
 And he, without saying anything,

381
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,300
 grabs the child from their arms and he holds it aloft.

382
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,340
 It's like the "Lion King" moment, right?

383
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,340
 He's like, (singing in foreign language)

384
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,380
 Now, could you imagine what that would have felt like

385
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,600
 for Mary and Joseph?

386
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,740
 Couple of years ago, quite a few years ago now,

387
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,820
 when Mia was just two years old,

388
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,580
 Chris and I were in Pacific Place one day,

389
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,620
 and we're just pushing Mia in a stroller

390
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,020
 through Pacific Place.

391
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,900
 And out of nowhere, this lady, this older lady,

392
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,180
 Chinese lady, she bursts forward and she gets on the knees.

393
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,580
 She stops the stroller, she gets on her knees,

394
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,340
 and she starts to touch Mia's face and play with her hair.

395
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,380
 And she starts to speak Cantonese over her.

396
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,180
 And this is a stranger to us.

397
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,420
 And we're like, "What are you doing?

398
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,860
 "This is our child, back off."

399
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:11,940
 Here's Simeon, and he takes Jesus in his arms.

400
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,660
 And I don't know if he held Jesus aloft,

401
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,860
 that's probably me just pretending, right?

402
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,300
 But he takes Jesus in his arms,

403
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,340
 filled with the Holy Spirit, and he sings a song.

404
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,980
 This is Simeon's moment.

405
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,980
 He's waited years.

406
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,380
 I want you to think about this.

407
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,900
 This is another picture of faithfulness.

408
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,100
 And you need to know that faithfulness

409
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,940
 does not guarantee you an easy life.

410
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,100
 You need to know that faithfulness doesn't always mean

411
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,820
 you're gonna suddenly walk into the blessings of God.

412
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,780
 Faithfulness, like what Susanna shared,

413
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,660
 sometimes requires some patience.

414
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,100
 It requires doing the same thing in and out,

415
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,540
 in and out, in and out,

416
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,420
 trusting that God will one day break through

417
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,900
 with his extraordinary.

418
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,220
 This is Simeon's moment.

419
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,060
 And I tell you what,

420
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,540
 if ever somebody had a prepared speech,

421
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,820
 surely it was this man.

422
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,740
 Years of preparation for this one moment.

423
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,660
 I mean, he must have thought,

424
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,780
 what is it that I will say?

425
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,900
 What is it that I will sing?

426
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,060
 What will I prophesy over this child?

427
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,020
 But filled with the Holy Spirit, he takes the child,

428
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,260
 and I want you to see the prepared speech

429
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,740
 that Simeon had on his heart.

430
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,060
 Are you ready for this?

431
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,780
 Starting in verse 29, this is what he sings.

432
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,780
 He sings, "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,

433
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,380
 "you now can dismiss your servant in peace.

434
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,140
 "I can die."

435
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,100
 That's the first thing he says, right?

436
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,020
 Like, this is taking a while, God.

437
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,980
 I'm old.

438
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,980
 Then he says this,

439
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,740
 "For my eyes have seen your salvation,

440
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,780
 "which you have prepared in the sight of all the people."

441
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,620
 And notice what he says,

442
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,380
 "A light for revelation to the Gentiles

443
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,180
 "and for glory to your people, Israel."

444
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,260
 A light for the revelation for the Gentiles

445
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,100
 and glory to your people, Israel.

446
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,300
 He holds Jesus in his hands,

447
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,660
 and he says, "This is what you need to know, Israel.

448
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,180
 "This one is a light for the revelation to the Gentiles

449
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,420
 "and the glory to us, Israel."

450
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,260
 Hang on a sec.

451
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,020
 Sit with this for a second.

452
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,300
 Let me read this to you again.

453
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,780
 He says this.

454
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,940
 "The first thing," he says about Jesus,

455
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,580
 "He is a light for the revelation to the Gentiles."

456
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,740
 Whoa, whoa, hang on one sec.

457
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,500
 I'm gonna read it one more time.

458
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,900
 I just wanna make sure that's right.

459
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,780
 "A light for the revelation to the Gentiles."

460
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,740
 The first thing that comes out of this faithful,

461
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,660
 Old Testament-type prophet,

462
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,700
 one who's righteous and devout,

463
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,860
 is he says, "This Jesus is gonna be the salvation,

464
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,340
 "the hope, the redemption, the life to the hated,

465
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,820
 "to the oppressing, to the painful,

466
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,820
 "to the unrighteous, the unclean Gentile."

467
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,340
 It's almost like if there was ever in history a moment

468
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,820
 where there is like the ripping of a record

469
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,940
 off of the needle, and it's like this (imitates ripping)

470
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,780
 It's like, what?

471
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,220
 Hang on a second.

472
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,420
 Like, that's the last thing the Jewish people

473
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,060
 were expecting to hear.

474
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,380
 Like this Messiah, surely He cannot be

475
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,940
 for the one who's oppressing us.

476
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,860
 Surely this Messiah cannot be for that unrighteous,

477
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,860
 unclean, disgusting, those people

478
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,660
 that lord themselves over us,

479
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,980
 those ones who have subjected us to that point

480
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,020
 for 600 years, these Romans that have us under control.

481
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,020
 No, that's not what we want.

482
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,780
 We are wanting a Messiah that does the second part

483
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,020
 of what Simeon says.

484
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,140
 He's a glory to us in Israel.

485
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,460
 Yes, we want a Messiah like that.

486
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,460
 I can get behind a Messiah who's the glory to Israel.

487
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,860
 But if you're asking me to sing a song

488
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,500
 about a Messiah who's the glory to our enemies,

489
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,940
 I've got a problem with that.

490
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,020
 Are you with me?

491
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,180
 It's interesting, isn't it?

492
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:17,140
 That grace is so often only amazing when it's grace for us.

493
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,220
 Think about that for a second.

494
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,740
 That so often grace is only really amazing

495
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,700
 when it's grace for people like us.

496
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,620
 Because surely God's grace is for people like us, right?

497
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,180
 You know, the good people, the righteous ones,

498
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,700
 you know, the ones that deserve it,

499
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,020
 the ones that have been under oppression

500
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,580
 for all these years.

501
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,060
 You know, the ones that have been called

502
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,620
 the chosen people of God,

503
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,900
 the ones that fill the pews of the churches

504
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,740
 around the world.

505
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,580
 I mean, we understand that grace is being given to us

506
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,140
 the favor of God placed upon us.

507
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,700
 Oh, I can sing a song like that.

508
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,220
 ♪ Amazing grace ♪

509
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,660
 ♪ How sweet the sound ♪

510
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,660
 ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪

511
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,420
 You know, the one like me,

00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,060
 you know, the one that deserves it,

513
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,740
 the one that's kind of, you know,

514
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,540
 come and align themselves with God,

515
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,500
 who's given his life to Jesus,

516
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,220
 who comes to church as much as I can,

517
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,980
 who sings and prays and believes and is faithful

518
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,140
 like Mary and Joseph and Simeon.

519
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,380
 I can sing a song about grace for people like me.

520
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,220
 Are you with me?

521
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,340
 That's not the song that Simeon is singing.

522
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,300
 That's not the song that he invites Israel to sing.

523
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,220
 Let me sing you the song that Simeon is singing.

524
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,540
 It sounds more like this.

525
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,060
 ♪ Amazing grace ♪

526
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,020
 ♪ How sweet the sound ♪

527
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,340
 ♪ That saved some wretches like them ♪

528
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,260
 (congregation laughing)

529
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,540
 That's what Simeon's singing,

530
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,260
 that this Jesus comes at Christmas,

531
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,260
 the advent of Christ, comes to save all people.

532
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,100
 Simeon is putting right before Israel

533
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,700
 the hardest of realities,

534
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,980
 that Christ is on behalf of the other,

535
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,460
 the one on the other side of the aisle,

536
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,860
 the one that we struggle to like,

537
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,740
 the one that we have a problem with,

538
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,300
 the one that has come and done something perhaps to us,

539
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,140
 the one that we deeply struggle and wrestle with.

540
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,700
 It's that one, Simeon is saying,

541
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,660
 that this Christ Messiah has also come for.

542
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,420
 It's not just an amazing grace for you.

543
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,420
 It's an amazing grace for anyone

544
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,460
 who would open their lives to the work of the Holy Spirit.

545
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,460
 A slave trader can sing that song.

546
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:58,280
 The question is, can we?

547
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,740
 Like, can we actually sing a song of grace

548
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,500
 for the one on the other side,

549
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,260
 the one who is different to us,

550
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,060
 the one who doesn't have our theology,

551
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,860
 doesn't have our lifestyle, doesn't have our practices,

552
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,420
 doesn't believe in our God,

553
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,180
 doesn't do things that we think are appropriate,

554
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,020
 the one who's out there or wherever it might be,

555
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,660
 can we also believe as a church that this Jesus came,

556
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,740
 not just for the nice people,

557
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,220
 whatever that is defined as,

558
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,380
 but that this Jesus came for all people,

559
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,960
 the slave trader and the free slave alike.

560
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,660
 Now, here's the powerful thing.

561
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,420
 Simeon's song is not a new song.

562
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,820
 This is just picking up the threads

563
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,620
 of God's redemptive heart in all of redemptive history.

564
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,180
 And in fact, Simeon is going right back

565
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
 into the Old Testament

566
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,020
 and drawing some of those themes out.

567
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,320
 He's going right back to Genesis chapter 12,

568
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,520
 where it all started,

569
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,840
 where Abraham was called to leave his family and move out

570
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,120
 and begin a new family,

571
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,920
 where the nation of Israel itself was birthed.

572
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,280
 At that moment, God appears to Abraham,

573
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,240
 shows him all the stars in the sky,

574
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,040
 and says, "Your descendants from you

575
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,120
 will be like those of the stars in the sky."

576
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,960
 And then he says this,

577
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,960
 "And through you, you will be a blessing to all nations."

578
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,440
 I mean, right at the foundation of it all,

579
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,560
 blessing to all nations.

580
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,260
 And then the Old Testament prophetic tradition

581
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,140
 keeps the going,

582
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,740
 the idea that God always wants to redeem,

583
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,140
 not just the Jew, but also the Gentile.

584
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,740
 In fact, the chapter of most central understanding

585
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,860
 of the Messiah coming as a child,

586
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,180
 Isaiah chapter nine,

587
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,500
 "For unto us a child is born."

588
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,180
 Now, Isaiah's prophecy about a child coming

589
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,980
 who would be the one who would grow up to redeem Israel,

590
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,220
 right at the start of that prophetic chapter,

591
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,000
 here's what Isaiah says.

592
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,920
 He says, "God will bring favor on the Gentiles of Galilee.

593
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,900
 Those who are in darkness will walk in light."

594
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,400
 It's right there in the Old Testament prophetic tradition,

595
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,520
 but somehow the Jews had begun to forget that

596
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,720
 so that when Simeon grabs this child

597
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,360
 and begins to sing a song like this,

598
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,280
 it was a song that was deeply challenging to them.

599
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,260
 Like how a freed slave in 1807

600
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,960
 might have struggled to sing a song

601
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,960
 written by an ex-slave trader.

602
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,360
 So Israel struggles to sing a song

603
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,600
 about a hope and redemption for their oppressors.

604
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,680
 I think Mary herself would have struggled

605
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,600
 to sing this song if we're honest.

606
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,720
 What was her song about?

607
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,760
 Her song was about the turning of the tables.

608
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,400
 Her song was about the rulers being brought down

609
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,920
 and the humble being lifted up.

610
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,800
 Her song was about hope for those that are under oppression.

611
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,440
 And I love this about the Christmas story,

612
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,320
 and we need to see this as the global church,

613
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,280
 particularly in this hour of our own history,

614
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,720
 that in the Bible Christmas story,

615
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,760
 yes, we have that beautiful picture

616
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,640
 of the turning upside down of the kingdom of God

617
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,440
 and the way that works in this world.

618
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,080
 We have hope for the oppressed,

619
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,360
 hope for those downtrodden, hope for those,

620
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,440
 'cause God's gonna come and turn the tables, absolutely.

621
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,960
 But we've also got in the same story,

622
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,960
 a song to be sung about God's grace being for everyone,

623
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,040
 even for the enemy and the oppressor.

624
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,320
 Those two things are not at wars with one another.

625
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,640
 They sit side by side in the beauty

626
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,360
 of what Christmas is all about.

627
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,440
 Out of the ordinary, God brings an extraordinary.

628
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,380
 And I think if we're honest with ourselves,

629
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,920
 we would realize that we also can struggle

630
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,500
 to sing a song of that kind of amazing grace.

631
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,840
 Each one of us has an other in our lives.

632
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,800
 I want you to take a moment just to think a little bit

633
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,840
 about who that other might be for you.

634
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,160
 Perhaps for some of us in this room,

635
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,740
 the other is a colleague,

636
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:17,160
 a colleague who has hurt us, who has done something,

637
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,400
 who has led in a certain way that we feel kind of overrun

638
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,000
 by a colleague that we're struggling to like

639
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,640
 and get on with.

640
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,120
 Or perhaps for some of you in this room,

641
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,440
 the other is an ex-boyfriend or an ex-girlfriend,

642
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,400
 somebody who's perhaps hurt you,

643
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,380
 somebody who's betrayed you, broken your heart,

644
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,920
 said something, done something,

645
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,560
 and you're still trying to deal

646
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,420
 with the aftermath of that reality.

647
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,440
 Perhaps for some of you in this room,

648
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,680
 the other is your parent.

649
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,600
 And your parent has never said to you once

650
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,880
 that they truly loved you.

651
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,280
 You've never heard those words.

652
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,240
 You've never felt adequate enough for them.

653
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,640
 You never felt you were good enough for them.

654
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,260
 And you've carried and harbored a sense of bitterness

655
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,040
 and resentment, even though perhaps you are open to them

656
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,200
 and you're in relationship with them,

657
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,680
 but deep inside you struggle

658
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,580
 to truly find yourself loving them.

659
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,120
 Or perhaps in this room, the other is a friend,

660
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,920
 a friend who has done something or hurt something

661
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,720
 or been in some way that has really turned you upside down,

662
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,380
 maybe betrayed you or whatever it is,

663
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,660
 did something you didn't expect

664
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,480
 and you're struggling to let go of that.

665
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,260
 Maybe in this room, your other is a person of authority.

666
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,800
 Maybe it's a pastor or a leader

667
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,440
 or someone in authority of your life

668
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,240
 who has made you feel less than who you truly are.

669
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,560
 Perhaps for you, the other is someone

670
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,760
 who has a political perspective different from yours.

671
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,640
 And you've seen and heard what they've done

672
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,760
 and you don't like it and you've been annoyed

673
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,920
 and frustrated by their posts on social media

674
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,520
 and their actions and you've harbored anger

675
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,380
 and upset and bitterness towards them.

676
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,740
 Our other could be a lot of different things,

677
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,080
 but the reality is each one of us

678
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,040
 has another other in our lives.

679
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,180
 And the challenge of Simeon's song

680
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:04,180
 and the beauty of Christmas is whether we can sing a song

681
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:09,620
 that has grace amazing enough that would enable us

682
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,920
 to sing that song about the other.

683
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,660
 Not that as Christians, we should subject ourselves

684
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,380
 under the abuse of the other.

685
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,940
 Not that it should be okay that we continue to be victims

686
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,940
 under the wheels of injustice, no.

687
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,100
 But we need to make sure that we guard as Christians

688
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,580
 against a hardness of heart

689
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,420
 towards those that have done things to us.

690
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,820
 And we need to guard against this reality

691
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,460
 that sometimes we have this kind of comfortable

692
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,540
 Christian theology, which puts us always on the good side

693
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,900
 and others on the bad side.

694
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,420
 And we need to realize that like Simeon

695
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,660
 cradling Jesus in his arms,

696
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,420
 Christ cradles the church in his arms.

697
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:03,420
 And he says, "Church, can you sing the song of grace

698
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,540
 "that is so amazing that it's even

699
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,020
 "for the one you don't like?"

700
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,660
 One of the great significant foundations

701
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,980
 of the Christian faith is this,

702
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,280
 that in the coming of Jesus,

703
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,160
 we have the coming of the reality of grace for all.

704
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,420
 A grace so amazing that it is offered

705
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,900
 even to the one that we think does not deserve it.

706
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:34,540
 Can you sing that song?

707
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,980
 A few years ago, quite a few years ago,

708
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,460
 as I was starting to be a pastor,

709
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,660
 I'd quit my job in finance

710
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,820
 and I had decided to become a pastor.

711
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,980
 And so I'd gone away and done some studies, come back,

712
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,380
 and the Vine was giving me my shot.

713
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,740
 They were giving me a chance to be a pastor.

714
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,820
 And I was beginning to preach a little bit in the church

715
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,360
 and I was beginning to get a little bit of a platform

716
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,980
 in the church where I was preaching a little bit regularly.

717
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,620
 And right there at the start, a man in the church,

718
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,740
 here at the Vine, made it his mission

719
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,820
 to make me feel as bad as possible

720
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,980
 about the decision I had made.

721
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,880
 He would come up to me after, I'm not even joking,

722
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,780
 every sermon, every week I preached.

723
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,940
 And he would come up to me straight away.

724
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,320
 He'd be the first in the prayer line.

725
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,780
 And he would never come forward and ask for prayer.

726
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,420
 He would only come forward to critique what I said.

727
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,940
 He would tell me all the things that I had forgotten,

728
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,540
 all the stories that I should have told,

729
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,260
 all the passages of scripture that changes

730
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,420
 and refutes everything that I had just preached.

731
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,660
 If he didn't catch me on the Sunday,

732
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
 he would send me an email on the Monday.

733
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,140
 He was faithful.

734
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,700
 Not the kind of faithfulness I like, but he was faithful.

735
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,820
 He would send me an email on Monday

736
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,940
 with a litany of stuff that I could have done better.

737
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,480
 This went on, I kid you not, it went on for years.

738
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,720
 And I'm grateful to my wife,

739
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,900
 'cause without her I would have crumbled.

740
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,700
 And I'm grateful to God's presence,

741
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,460
 that I managed to somehow get through it all.

742
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,300
 I haven't thought about that guy for a number of years,

743
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,580
 but as I was preparing this message a couple of weeks ago

744
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,620
 and thinking about what I was gonna preach,

745
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,360
 immediately he came to mind again.

746
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,860
 And it was the Holy Spirit saying this,

747
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,080
 "You can't sing that song about him, can you?"

748
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,900
 And I was like, "No."

749
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,600
 I believe grace is amazing, but it's not that amazing.

750
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,260
 And I knew that I could not stand before you today

751
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,100
 and preach this message without having gotten myself

752
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,860
 into the point of truly forgiving that person

753
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,700
 and releasing them, to truly wanting

754
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:51,500
 the light of revelation and the beauty of God's presence

755
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,940
 to be in their lives.

756
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,020
 And I can stand before you today

757
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,300
 and tell you that I've done that.

758
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,060
 And here's how I was able to do it.

759
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:04,100
 Verse 27, "Moved by the Spirit,

760
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,340
 "Simeon went into the temple courts."

761
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,980
 The only way that we are able to truly sing the song

762
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,460
 of the one who has offended and hurt us,

763
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,620
 a song of great, amazing grace for them,

764
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,940
 is through a move of the Spirit.

765
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,460
 It cannot be done in our own strength.

766
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,140
 It cannot be done by some good strategy.

767
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,360
 It can't be done by just trying to work it up inside of us.

768
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,580
 I thought that's what I had done years ago with this person,

769
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,520
 but the Holy Spirit brought it back to me

770
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,660
 because I hadn't really dealt with it.

771
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,740
 The only way you are able to sing a song of grace

772
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,340
 for the one on the other side of your life

773
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,740
 is by a move of the Holy Spirit.

774
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,100
 And I believe that there is nothing more Christmas

775
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,240
 or Advent for you in this season

776
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,540
 than for you to not just receive an amazing grace,

777
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,280
 but for you to truly be able to offer an amazing grace.

778
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,460
 Could we sing that song?

779
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,080
 I wonder whether you'd stand with me,

780
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,880
 and I wanna create some space for us to pray.

781
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:11,500
 I wanna encourage you, if this is speaking to you today,

782
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,440
 our eyes are closed, you're not doing this for my benefit.

783
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,080
 The Holy Spirit wants to come now

784
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,560
 and move by His Spirit on you.

785
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,420
 And so if this message has been important to you

786
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,300
 for whatever reason, if there's an other that you know

787
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,720
 that you're struggling to offer grace to,

788
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,760
 I wonder whether you'd just open your hands before you,

789
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,300
 just quietly, no one's looking.

790
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,260
 'Cause I wanna pray for those in this room

791
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,980
 where this is important for you,

792
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,480
 where there's a song to be sung

793
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,540
 that you're struggling to sing right now.

794
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:55,320
 Father, I wanna pray now just for everybody in this room,

795
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,740
 Lord, whose hands are before you.

796
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,800
 Lord, we do that as a symbol of humility.

797
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,240
 And I wanna pray now for the work of the Holy Spirit

798
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,560
 to do what my words, what no sermon

799
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,680
 or anything can really do.

800
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,680
 The work of the Holy Spirit to enable us

801
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:21,220
 to find a place of healing, a place of restoration,

802
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,700
 a place of reconciliation, if that's possible.

803
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,660
 It may not be possible for every circumstance and situation,

804
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:35,760
 but a profound place of grace.

805
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,480
 Father, we need this so much.

806
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,220
 Father, I pray for each person in this room

807
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,320
 that your Holy Spirit would come now.

808
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,220
 Lord, Simeon was moved by your Spirit.

809
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,220
 We need to be moved by your Spirit, Lord.

810
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,900
 We cannot forgive these people.

811
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,660
 We cannot release this burden.

812
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,100
 We cannot genuinely sing of grace for them

813
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,260
 unless it's a move of your Spirit in us.

814
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,580
 So I wanna give you time and space now.

815
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:17,420
 Father, we need this so much in our city right now,

816
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,660
 where families have been torn apart,

817
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,160
 marriages have been broken,

818
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,880
 where companies struggle,

819
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,300
 where divisions are deep over the last two to three years.

820
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,500
 Father, we need a profound work of your Spirit

821
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,840
 on the church in our city.

822
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,500
 And we need a profound work of your Spirit

823
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,960
 on and in the streets of this city.

824
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,700
 And what better time for that work of the Spirit

825
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,540
 than Advent?

826
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,120
 (gentle music)

827
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,620
 Lord, I wanna pray that songs would rise up in this city

828
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:01,180
 where we can genuinely say a light of revelation

829
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,100
 for that one.

830
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,380
 Grace and mercy, God, for that one.

831
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,140
 And Holy Spirit, I ask that you would move now

832
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,660
 for these ones in this room.

833
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,620
 Sometimes we recognize, Lord,

834
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,660
 that the ones that we are at enmity with

835
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,160
 are sitting around us in the pews of our churches.

836
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,900
 And so, Lord, I wanna pray for a restoration of division

837
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,320
 in this church at the Vine.

838
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,860
 Wherever the enemy has gotten in

839
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,640
 to create division in the last few years,

840
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,500
 we come against that in the name of Jesus.

841
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,420
 And Lord, we pray for a mercy and a grace

842
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,900
 to pour out on the Vine, pour out on us,

843
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,920
 so that we might be able to walk towards one another

844
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,760
 with true peace in our hearts.

845
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,600
 (gentle music)

846
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,520
 As Simeon would say,

847
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,040
 "Lord, you can now dismiss your servant in peace."

848
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,760
 Lord, I know that there are many in this room

849
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,920
 that have been carrying and harboring disappointment,

850
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,920
 bitterness, hurt, in some cases for very good reasons.

851
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,080
 Would a move of your Spirit come, Lord,

852
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,560
 that would enable us to truly experience amazing grace?

853
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:24,560
 I just pray you would allow yourself

854
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,640
 to sit in this moment of ministry.

855
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,160
 I'd like if the team in a second

856
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,480
 just begin to sing over us,

857
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,080
 but don't feel like you need to rush into worship.

858
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,280
 In fact, it might be nice for them to sing over you

859
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,400
 the words of this hymn.

860
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,980
 And in your own heart, just allow the Holy Spirit

861
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,360
 to continue to heal and to speak to you.

862
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,780
 Allow His profound work upon you.

863
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,200
 (soft music)

864
00:41:52,200 --> 00:42:02,200
