1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
 He has a special gift and talent to bringing people around him

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,000
 and just to make people feel so welcomed

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 when they're with him, hanging out with him.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,000
 So, really blessed to have Leslie speaking in the front

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 and welcoming everyone in today.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,400
 So, many of you know that I used to be a teacher.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,600
 So, I'm going to give you a test and ask you a question.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,600
 One day, a student gave me this during class.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,600
 Ta-da!

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,400
 And why? Why did they give this to me?

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,000
 So, let's see if you can figure it out.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,400
 A. They used it and want me to throw it away for them.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,600
 Happens all the time. Is it the case?

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,000
 B. They found it on the floor, didn't know whose it was

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,600
 and wanted me to help find the owner.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,600
 Every little thing is precious to them. So is this one.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
 C. It was something they made as a gift for me.

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,400
 A, B and C. All of them happened in class.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,000
 What about this one?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,200
 Who thinks it is A?

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,800
 Yep, yep. Happens all the time.

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,400
 What about B?

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,600
 No. C?

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,600
 You are right. Let's give yourself a big hand.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,000
 This time, it was C.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So, as I was teaching writing,

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,200
 I'm trying to get them to write a whole piece of letter, right?

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,400
 And then in the middle of it, a child came up to me and go,

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,800
 "Ms. Chan, I'm going to give you this."

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,200
 I go, "Why? Why?"

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
 And then the girl sitting next to her said,

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
 "Oh, because she made it all lesson.

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,200
 "She used the whole lesson just to make this

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,800
 "and wanted to give it to you."

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,600
 And I asked her, "What is it?"

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,000
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is a mop.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,600
 This is a mop.

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,200
 So, well done. Well done. Thank you for the effort.

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,000
 But I'm so thankful that she cared for me so much.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,600
 But could you not do this in the middle of class?

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,800
 Not when I'm trying to get through something, right?

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,400
 But this is how kids are.

43
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,600
 They seem to have a sensor that they sense that you are in a hurry

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,000
 and you want to do something,

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,200
 and they want to do something opposite.

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,200
 You want to get them out of the house, they want to pee.

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,000
 I hear a loud "mm."

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,600
 When you want them to go wash, to go shower,

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,800
 they want to read a book.

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,400
 When you want them to be out of the shower, they say no.

51
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,600
 This is how kids are.

52
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
 They are very creative, they are very impulsive,

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,000
 and they have a special energy around them.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,800
 And so working with them takes a strong heart, you know?

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
 Because they look so cute on the outside,

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 they're cute on the inside too, just to say.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,600
 But they are very direct.

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,800
 When they don't want to hang out with you, they just say no.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
 Sometimes they just forgot to say no,

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
 and they just turn and run away.

61
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,200
 And you still have to smile because you can't be too mean to kids.

62
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,400
 I try not to be too mean to kids sometimes, right?

63
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,800
 And so, but God actually, through a lot of His passage,

64
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,000
 and a lot of His sermon,

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,200
 tells us that we need to value them because God values them.

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,800
 Kids are so direct and so impulsive,

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,200
 but Jesus often used the qualities of children

68
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,800
 to remind us to be more like Him.

69
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
 He taught us not to look down on any child

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
 because God values them deeply,

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,000
 even revealing the secrets of His kingdom to them.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,400
 For example, whoever welcomes one of these little children

73
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,200
 in My name welcomes Me,

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,400
 and whoever welcomes Me does not welcome Me,

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,600
 but the one who sent Me.

76
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,400
 See that you do not despise one of these little ones,

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
 for I tell you that there are angels in heaven

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,000
 always see the face of My Father in heaven.

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
 At that time Jesus said,

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,600
 "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,

81
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,600
 because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned

82
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
 and revealed them to little children."

83
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,400
 So as the series emphasized,

84
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,400
 when we are called to be a church that is multi-ethnic,

85
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,800
 multicultural, and intergenerational,

86
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,400
 a church that truly lives out God's unity,

87
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,600
 how do we walk with children?

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,200
 When Jesus repeatedly tells us to learn from children,

89
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,800
 and even says anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God

90
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,200
 like a little child will never enter it,

91
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,000
 then what kind of community should we be?

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,200
 So that instead of suppressing

93
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,400
 the unique qualities of our children,

94
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,200
 we actually are embracing and learning from them.

95
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,800
 Today our scripture comes from Mark 10, 13 to 16.

96
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,400
 In verse 13 to 14 it says,

97
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,800
 "People were bringing little children to Jesus for Him

98
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,000
 to place His hand on them,

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,200
 but the disciples rebuked them.

100
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,000
 When Jesus saw this, He was indignant."

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,200
 This indignant emotion was not simply like,

102
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,400
 "Oh, my father, I broke my father's fast,"

103
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
 or "I broke my father's fast," she was indignant.

104
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,200
 It was not that simple.

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,400
 Actually, in the original Greek, it's a much stronger word.

106
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,000
 It means extremely displeased.

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,800
 This word is rarely used in the New Testament.

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,400
 It is one of the strongest terms to describe Jesus' emotion.

109
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,800
 According to scholars like R.T. Franz and Greg Evans

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,400
 in the original language,

111
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,600
 this word is typically used to describe righteous anger

112
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,600
 when justice is violated or God's will is being ignored.

113
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,000
 This story, seemingly like a very simple story,

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 someone approached Jesus when He's teaching

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,400
 and then the disciples say,

116
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,600
 "Shh, don't come, don't come right now."

117
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,800
 Jesus was indignant.

118
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,400
 The culture of the kingdom culture

119
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,800
 and God's justice was being violated.

120
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
 What happened there?

121
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,600
 What is there for us to learn?

122
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,000
 This isn't just some any ordinary disappointment.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,400
 This actually is a deep sensitivity to God's heart.

124
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,600
 And you see this kind of emotion in the New Testament,

125
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
 also at Lazarus' tomb,

126
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,200
 when Jesus sees the devastation death has brought into humanity.

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,600
 And in Gethsemane, when God's heart...

128
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,000
 when Jesus is deeply grieved by the disciples' weakness,

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,400
 it's closely related to God's love, justice, and mercy.

130
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
 It's a righteous anger when God's heart

131
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,000
 and the culture of God's kingdom are being violated.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,600
 So what aspect of the kingdom culture did the disciples violate?

133
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,000
 First, the disciples thought they could be gatekeepers for the Lord,

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,800
 deciding who was worthy to receive blessing and who's not.

135
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,200
 So in Jesus' time, it was a tradition

136
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,000
 where fathers would bring their children to the local synagogue

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 and there the synagogue elders and the fathers

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,600
 would pray a blessing over the little children.

139
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,200
 Now the people bringing their children to Jesus,

140
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,600
 they were simply wanting to continue this tradition of blessing,

141
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,600
 except this time that they want Jesus to do the blessing directly.

142
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
 But the important point this time

143
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,600
 was not about people bringing children to Jesus.

144
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,400
 It's actually more about the disciples' reaction.

145
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,000
 The text said the disciples rebuked them.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,200
 And we have to ask, why did the disciples rebuke them?

147
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,400
 Didn't the disciples, didn't the people want children to be blessed?

148
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,000
 In Romans' law and culture at that time, children have very low status.

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Very different from now where we like or try to provide

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,800
 all the things that we could for the baby.

151
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
 We want the best for them.

152
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,800
 We put a lot of emphasis and attention to our little children.

153
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,600
 But at that time, children's status were low.

154
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,800
 Why? Because they couldn't bring anything to the table right now.

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 They couldn't help with the family right now.

156
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,200
 There's nothing that they could do right now.

157
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,800
 And so the children up to age 14 has a very low status.

158
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,400
 The father has a total authority over the children, even life and death.

159
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,200
 Children have no independent legal rights.

160
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,000
 And most of the time, they were only valued

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,600
 for what they might contribute in the future.

162
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:39,600
 This mindset deeply influenced how society and individuals see value.

163
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,400
 Meanwhile, Jesus was in the middle of teaching

164
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,600
 and the Pharisees were present, challenging him with questions

165
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
 and asking him about the law.

166
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,800
 The disciples saw that Jesus was doing something important.

167
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,400
 How could Jesus' work be interrupted at that moment?

168
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,400
 So, according to their own thinking and judgment,

169
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,800
 the disciples put up a barrier,

170
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,000
 dividing the people into those who can approach Jesus

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 and those who could not.

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,400
 In doing so, they're actually creating a spiritual hierarchy

173
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,200
 between assuming that adults have more qualification

174
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,000
 than children to approach Jesus.

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,200
 Maybe sometimes with the children ourselves,

176
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,000
 we felt that, "Oh, I don't really understand that."

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,400
 Or people think that, "Oh, they don't really understand that."

178
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,000
 Let them come to this event next time.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,400
 When they're ready, they can come.

180
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,400
 We're actually assuming what they know or what they are

181
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,600
 according to our judgment and our value,

182
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
 and we are creating barriers.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
 But in God's kingdom, there's no place for hierarchy.

184
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,800
 There's no place for barrier.

185
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,600
 No one is higher or lower than one another.

186
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 So the disciples' reaction is like a mirror,

187
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,400
 reflecting the choices that we make in our heart

188
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,200
 about what we consider is important,

189
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,200
 about knowledge, and about relationship.

190
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,000
 The Pharisees are important, so the children can't come.

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,400
 Knowledge is more important, so blessings can wait.

192
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
 When can they come?

193
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,800
 Only when they're old enough to understand.

194
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,000
 When they grow up, then they can come.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,200
 We often hear that very positive children is our future,

196
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,400
 as if their value only lies in what they might become.

197
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,400
 But Jesus see them as valuable now.

198
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,600
 Though children may not serve in obvious way,

199
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,800
 but their presence, their faith, and their service

200
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,000
 is just as important as any adults.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,200
 I know that I need to work on my patience.

202
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,400
 I know that from a long time ago in the invention of WhatsApp.

203
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
 In WhatsApp, you send a message,

204
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 and I expect that to be replied within three hours.

205
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,200
 Well, it's been a few hours.

206
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,000
 You need to--you have seen it.

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 You should reply to me.

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,200
 But I realized that my impatience

209
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,600
 was actually my self-centeredness.

210
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,800
 I want things to happen in my way according to my time,

211
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,400
 and I did not think about any other people.

212
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
 And so I really prayed to God and said,

213
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,200
 "God, I really want to--

214
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,600
 I want you to bless me with patience.

215
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,400
 I want you to bless me with gentleness."

216
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,400
 And he did through a student.

217
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 So actually, the student is in primary four.

218
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,400
 He has a mild case of autistic traits

219
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,400
 so that when during primary one to primary three,

220
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,000
 they have the same class, they have the same classmate,

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,400
 they have the same class teachers.

222
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,600
 But in primary four, everything changed for him.

223
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,400
 New classmate, new class teacher.

224
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,800
 So he really couldn't handle it.

225
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
 What would he do?

226
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,400
 He would throw things across the class.

227
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,600
 He would scrunch up my worksheet

228
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
 and just threw it across the classroom

229
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,000
 and say, "I don't want to do this."

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,800
 He would spat at teachers and at kids.

231
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,400
 He would shoot rubber bands,

232
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,800
 and he would violently, forcefully

233
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,000
 shake his desk and chairs,

234
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,600
 hurting himself and even others.

235
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,200
 So myself and the social workers are always on call.

236
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,200
 If anything happened during subject lessons,

237
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,200
 we are there to help take him away.

238
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,600
 But what makes it challenging

239
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,800
 is that you can't break through his stubbornness

240
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,800
 through lecturing him, through telling him what to think,

241
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,600
 because he couldn't process any, you know,

242
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,400
 discussion and reasoning.

243
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,200
 The only way that you can work with him at that time

244
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,400
 was through patience and gentleness.

245
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
 And more patience and more patience

246
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
 while you're still holding a boundary until you have none,

247
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,800
 and then you need to give some more.

248
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,000
 At the end of the year,

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,400
 we finally found a way that we can work with each other.

250
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,200
 But I realized that not only this incident has helped me,

251
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,000
 actually, I was on the verge of breakdown as well,

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 every single day, with the workload and with everything,

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 but I realized that God was using this child

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
 to answer my prayer.

255
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,200
 He did not use this child's intelligence

256
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,800
 or inspirational speech or his pure heart to change me.

257
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,200
 No, he used his whole life, the kid's life,

258
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
 to impact my life.

259
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
 There's nothing wrong with him,

260
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
 and there's nothing wrong with me,

261
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,000
 but as life collides,

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,600
 sparks came out and we're able to affect one another.

263
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,000
 And I think that's the beauty of working with children,

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
 because they're so unknown,

265
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,000
 because God has created them so beautifully

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,800
 that when we open our lives to them,

267
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,800
 they actually inspire me and help me in such a powerful way.

268
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 And it's not just him.

269
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,000
 Every single child that I've met,

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 whether it was, has influenced me,

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
 maybe it's their encouragement,

272
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,000
 maybe it's their cooperation,

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,400
 maybe sometimes they are not cooperating

274
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
 or they are not encouraging,

275
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,000
 but whenever I worked with them,

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,600
 they triggered reflection in my head.

277
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,800
 And I go, "Why did I respond that way?

278
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
 What happened to me just then?

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,800
 Why was I feeling that?"

280
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,800
 And in so, my life was changed.

281
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,000
 And that was often seen in K4C,

282
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 where we would open up a space for kids to encounter Jesus

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 and listen to His Word.

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And they would actually hear God

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
 and encourage me in that way.

286
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000
 So I'd like to share two videos with you today.

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Let's have a look.

288
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,200
 So in class today, we read Psalm 23

289
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
 and God spoke to some students.

290
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
 So Derek, would you like to share with us

291
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
 what did God tell you?

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 So the sentence from Psalm 23,

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,800
 "He gives me everything I need,"

294
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,800
 is like a situation that I really need help for.

295
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,800
 And I think God would give me a solution for it.

296
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
 Awesome. Thank you so much, Derek.

297
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,200
 So Adelina, what did God tell you today?

298
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,400
 That He gives me strength

299
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,800
 and that He will guide me through everything that I need.

300
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,400
 That He will guide me through the things that are hard for me.

301
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,200
 That He will understand what I go through.

302
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,600
 Thank you so much.

303
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
 Let's give a big hand to those children.

304
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
 (audience applauding)

305
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
 I needed that word at that time.

306
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
 I needed God to remind me that God will provide for me,

307
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
 that God is my Savior.

308
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
 I didn't teach them anything,

309
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,600
 so they came up with these reflection.

310
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
 I just opened up a space for them,

311
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,200
 helping them to connect to Jesus

312
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,400
 and Jesus will speak to them.

313
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,800
 The Holy Spirit inside the children

314
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,600
 are not baby Holy Spirits.

315
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,800
 There are no baby Holy Spirits.

316
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,000
 The Holy Spirit that you and I receive

317
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,800
 is the same as the children receive.

318
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,000
 When we connect them to Jesus,

319
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 when we allow them to listen to the Holy Spirit,

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,200
 God will talk to them and we listen.

321
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,000
 And so God didn't wait for these children to grow up,

322
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,200
 to be knowledgeable or capable

323
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,200
 before using them to change our communities.

324
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,600
 God used children in the present to accomplish His works.

325
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,400
 Our children are not just our future.

326
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,600
 They are part of our present.

327
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,200
 God uses each of us as part of the body of Christ

328
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
 to serve one another.

329
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,400
 And He's also using our little ones

330
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,600
 to serve every one of us here.

331
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,000
 The unity of church isn't just about adults,

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,600
 but the unity across ages, background, and abilities

333
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,600
 where everyone can be seen, heard, and blessed.

334
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,200
 After Jesus rebuked the disciples,

335
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
 He continued speaking.

336
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,000
 In verse 14 to 15, it says,

337
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,200
 "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them.

338
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,000
 For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.

339
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,800
 Truly I tell you,

340
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
 anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God

341
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,800
 like a little child will never enter it."

342
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,200
 God isn't talking to the parents and say,

343
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,000
 "Don't worry about them. Let them come. Let them come."

344
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,600
 He's actually talking to the disciples,

345
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,600
 telling them, "Don't hinder them."

346
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
 This is not--oh, hang on.

347
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
 "Just bring your little children here."

348
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
 Jesus was speaking very directly to His disciples.

349
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,800
 He was saying, "Why are you blocking them from coming to me?

350
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,200
 Don't you see that the people who enter my kingdom

351
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,600
 must be like these little children?"

352
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
 When you hear the phrase "become like children,"

353
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
 what comes to your mind?

354
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
 Their cuteness?

355
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,400
 That's too bad. I'm too late for that.

356
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,000
 Their innocence?

357
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,800
 But Paul also said, "When I become an adult,

358
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 I put away childish things."

359
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,600
 So if God's message was, "Be like a child."

360
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,000
 If you don't get what you want, just throw a tantrum

361
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,600
 and do whatever you want and don't care about consequences.

362
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,200
 Then imagine heaven having a group of adults

363
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
 throwing tantrums on the floor.

364
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
 That doesn't really work.

365
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,800
 But I believe that when Jesus talks about

366
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,000
 having childlike faith,

367
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 He is pointing to two important qualities.

368
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
 First, children need help.

369
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,000
 At the core of Christian faith is to admit that

370
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,600
 before God, we are completely helpless.

371
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,800
 We don't have the strength to always do what is right

372
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
 or know what is right.

373
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,800
 We are living in a very confusing world right now

374
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,000
 where everyone has a voice to speak about different things.

375
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
 Everything is impossible.

376
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,200
 And as a parent or as an adult or just a person

377
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
 trying to live in the world,

378
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,200
 it is hard and we are helpless in that way.

379
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
 Or we do not have the spiritual power

380
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,600
 to live a perfect and disciplined life.

381
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,400
 Our emotions aren't always mature

382
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,000
 and we can't always be able to respond to others

383
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,200
 with love and compassion.

384
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,600
 The truth is, on our own,

385
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,200
 we simply can't live the true Christian life.

386
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,000
 Just like a newborn baby

387
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,600
 who can't survive without someone to care for them,

388
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 we can't survive living in this world without God.

389
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
 We are helpless before God.

390
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,600
 So real faith means recognizing our helplessness

391
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 and giving up trying to do everything by our own strength

392
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,400
 and resting fully in God's arms.

393
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,800
 The second quality, children are dependent.

394
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,400
 Since we're helpless, we must rely completely on God.

395
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,000
 The Lord is our provider.

396
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Everything in our lives, both now and forever,

397
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,200
 comes from His grace and His provision.

398
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,600
 You think about that.

399
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,200
 When I was in school and I was thinking about the promotion

400
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
 or getting this and that,

401
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,000
 I realized at that moment that I was able to get that job

402
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 not because I backed for it,

403
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,600
 not because of the qualities that I think I have on my resume.

404
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
 It was because God has opened doors for me

405
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,400
 and letting me to be in this position.

406
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,200
 When I think about living in this world

407
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,800
 and I worry about finance

408
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,600
 and I think about all the things I need to take care of,

409
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,800
 at the end of the day, who puts bread on my table?

410
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,000
 At the end of the day, what door opened?

411
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,200
 What people did I meet that I'm able to do what I'm doing now?

412
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,600
 It's not through my striving.

413
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,800
 It was totally and completely on God's grace and provision.

414
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,600
 And so to enter God's kingdom,

415
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,000
 we must become like children to omit our helplessness

416
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,200
 and to learn to depend on Him.

417
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,000
 And this is how truly we inherit God's kingdom

418
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,200
 and experience abundance life.

419
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
 And the way children serve among us

420
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,400
 is not just about moving tables or making coffees

421
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,200
 or playing the guitar or the drums,

422
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,400
 but rather, every time we serve them,

423
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,800
 it reminds us that we too can ask for help.

424
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
 We too can be the little children who said,

425
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,000
 "I can't do this, God. I need your help.

426
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,200
 I don't know how to respond to that.

427
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,200
 You need to help me. I rely on you to help me."

428
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,400
 Whenever the children can't do something,

429
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,600
 they let us know and we should do the same

430
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,000
 and let God know that I feel frustrated right now.

431
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,200
 I know that you've placed this purpose, this task in my heart,

432
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,600
 but I failed. I screwed up. I was impatient.

433
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,800
 God, please come and help me.

434
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,400
 This relationship is what gets us into the kingdom of God

435
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,000
 because the kingdom of God is not by our own strength,

436
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,600
 but knowing that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.

437
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,800
 Children in our midst are indispensable.

438
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 It's not about saying, "All right, we can bring you along.

439
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,600
 Just keep up and hurry."

440
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,200
 Or, you know, somehow, sometimes you see parents

441
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,800
 taking the hand of the children.

442
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,600
 Very sweet, very protective, very nice, right?

443
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
 But they're actually dragging the children.

444
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,800
 Not a way of protection, but just hurry up and get there.

445
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,600
 We're not supposed to walk with our children that way.

446
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
 They are slower. They need our help.

447
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,800
 But perhaps what we really need is for them to slow us down,

448
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,000
 to remind us that we are not a community just to get things done,

449
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,400
 but we are a community to become family together.

450
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
 Let me say this again.

451
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,200
 Perhaps what we really need is for them to slow us down,

452
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,400
 to remind us that we're not a community of just to get things done,

453
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,400
 but a community for becoming family together.

454
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
 We need time to grow as a family.

455
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,400
 We need to look out for each other like a family.

456
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,600
 We need to work hard to be inclusive in a family,

457
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,800
 to see, to love, and to connect.

458
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,000
 So what does Jesus call us to do as a community?

459
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,400
 What does it really mean to let the little children come to me

460
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,400
 and to not hinder them?

461
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,400
 If the disciples' original mistakes was to let their own way of thinking

462
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,800
 and standard to decide who was worthy to come near Jesus,

463
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,600
 now Jesus is saying to them, "I want you to let me

464
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,600
 and these children connect directly without barriers."

465
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,200
 Back in the day, I used to have people to come and observe my class,

466
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,000
 you know, for appraisal and many other different things, right?

467
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,200
 My class was actually okay.

468
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,000
 You know, the things that I planned should work out okay.

469
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 But the biggest unknown are the children.

470
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,400
 When strangers come, when they see something different,

471
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,000
 they either get really, really happy and joyful and wanted to perform.

472
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,800
 There's this one time when I was being observed in my Primary 1 class,

473
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,800
 the principal came in and the girl wants to sing to her in my class.

474
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,000
 Or they could either respond very passively and very scared

475
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,200
 and very shy and very self-conscious.

476
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,200
 So I will be teaching the same class, but they will have no response

477
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,600
 as if I've never taught them anything.

478
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,200
 I mean, like, come on, this is my peers, this is a peer observation.

479
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,400
 You are not answering any questions.

480
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,800
 I've taught you something, remember?

481
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,600
 They don't, they don't.

482
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,800
 But that's...so before lesson observation, this is what I always do.

483
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,000
 To the really cute little class, I would say, "Please try to calm down.

484
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 There will be someone coming in.

485
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,200
 Calm down.

486
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,400
 If you have questions, try to hold it,

487
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,000
 like you're holding yourself to the toilet, just hold it."

488
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,400
 Or I would pre-teach them a little something

489
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,600
 so that they won't totally don't know what I'm doing

490
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,000
 and not be responsive at all.

491
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,200
 But isn't it sometimes it's like that for us as well?

492
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,400
 We are trying to be good.

493
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,200
 We're trying to fix ourselves before we go to Jesus.

494
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
 We're trying to say, "Oh, I haven't learned enough.

495
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,200
 Let me learn more so I can pray for others.

496
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,600
 Oh, I haven't prayed enough.

497
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 Let me pray more before I pray for other people.

498
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
 Oh, I haven't fixed myself yet.

499
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,800
 I am so self-conscious about who I am right now."

500
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,000
 God isn't saying, "Let those well-behaved come to me."

501
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,200
 He is not saying, "Let those who can memorize Bible verses come to me."

502
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,000
 He's saying, "Just come.

503
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,200
 Just come. Come as you are."

504
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,600
 No matter they are little kids or older kids

505
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,200
 or ourselves right now, we do not have to pretend.

506
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,400
 We do not need to live another life before we approach our Jesus

507
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:38,600
 because Jesus said, "Just come."

508
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,200
 And that is not just a calling for parents.

509
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,000
 It's a calling for all of us as His disciples.

510
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,800
 Like the Proverbs that says,

511
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,200
 "It takes a whole village to raise a child."

512
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,800
 The spiritual growth of child, of children,

513
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,200
 isn't just the responsibility of parents,

514
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,800
 but the whole community, the whole church,

515
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,400
 how we walk with each child and the family.

516
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,600
 And that's why we have baby dedication ceremonies.

517
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,000
 It is our collective response.

518
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Through this ritual, we bring each child before the Lord together.

519
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Many of you actually have been through one of these baby dedications before, right?

520
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,400
 Do you remember what you have promised?

521
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,400
 So we're going to have a look and see what does it mean for the church,

522
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,200
 for the parents, ourselves to respond to the calling of walking with children together.

523
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,400
 So to the parents, we have asked them a series of questions.

524
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,600
 Can we have the slide, the next slide? Yes.

525
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:48,400
 Are you willing to let the kids grow up in God's unconditional love?

526
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,800
 It is hard when we haven't experienced unconditional love ourselves when we were growing up.

527
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,200
 But are we willing to try to work on ourselves and go,

528
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:06,200
 "Hey, this is unconditional love. What is it? How can I work towards that for my child?"

529
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,000
 Will you do your best to teach the kids the right path to walk?

530
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,600
 But most importantly, in the community,

531
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,600
 are we willing to let others to do that for us as well?

532
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:25,800
 I've been in a school situation where two kids were fighting while actually one is hitting the other.

533
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,600
 The kid A said, "Yes, I did it. I'm so sorry."

534
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,800
 You call the parents and the parents said, "Oh, you made him admit that he was doing wrong."

535
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:39,200
 And it was in such an opposition that it was hard for me to work with the parents and go,

536
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,000
 "Hey, actually, we're just trying to bring up the children together."

537
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,600
 We are actually in a cooperation way to work together.

538
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,000
 So as parents, I know that there are different styles of understanding.

539
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 But are we willing to open our hearts and try to put ourselves in the village?

540
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,200
 We can't live in a village unless we admit that we are in one.

541
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,600
 So it is a thinker. It doesn't mean that we have to do all of that, by the way.

542
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,000
 We just talked about we're helpless.

543
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,200
 We are. As a parent, we are.

544
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,400
 As a member of the church family, we are also helpless.

545
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,600
 How do we work towards that?

546
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,200
 Thirdly, will you teach the kids about Jesus Christ and His love for them and for all people?

547
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:33,000
 And will you pray for the kids that they would become a child God can use for His glory?

548
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
 They are all very big questions.

549
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,800
 And this responsibility doesn't just rest on you.

550
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:48,000
 Be in the village. Open up and see how we as a church can walk together and build this up together.

551
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 But what about the others, the rest, to the follower of Jesus Christ?

552
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,600
 Are you willing to commit to supporting these parents in raising their child?

553
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,400
 I understand talking to children is not everyone's forte.

554
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,000
 Kids have their own energy and their own way of saying and thinking.

555
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,200
 But I would encourage you to talk to the parents and ask them,

556
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,400
 "What can I do for you today? How are you doing?"

557
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,800
 And often as I ask these questions, they will tell me,

558
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,800
 "Oh, actually, I just need someone to keep an eye on him while I rehearse for worship."

559
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:35,600
 Maybe it's just, "Oh, I need to go to this training or that training, and I just need to get lunch for my kid."

560
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,400
 These are some of the support we can do.

561
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:44,000
 It's not always about children, but actually it's the family that needs support.

562
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,800
 Spend some time. Be their friend. Be their friend.

563
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,400
 Sometimes a parent needs conversation outside of child-rearing.

564
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,200
 Can I get an amen for that?

565
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,400
 We need to have conversation with friends to make us feel like human again.

566
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,000
 That's what I feel like when I was a teacher.

567
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,400
 I don't always just want to talk about teaching stuff.

568
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,000
 I have other interests. I have other joy and passion as well.

569
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,200
 Be our friend and ask us what we need support with.

570
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
 Let's have to look at the next question.

571
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,800
 Will you be patient, listen to them, and help them when needed?

572
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,000
 I am so happy. I'm so grateful for myself as well.

573
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,800
 Well done, June, that we were actually a very patient church,

574
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,200
 that we recognize that there are children in our midst,

575
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,200
 and they do cry, and they need to all recognize their own emotions.

576
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,400
 And we're okay, and we give time and space for them.

577
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,800
 And I think we can continue on and ask ourselves,

578
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,000
 how can I grow from there?

579
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,200
 What else can I do to support the children when they have needs?

580
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
 Or how can I support the family?

581
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,600
 Can I be more patient to the families that have children, right?

582
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:08,800
 And also, the third one, will you also strive, us all,

583
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,000
 to be a model of Christ's love,

584
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,600
 so that the kids can grow up in an environment and community

585
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,200
 that always points them to their creation?

586
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,600
 Our vision for K4C is just what today's scripture described.

587
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,400
 It is a place where we remove all the barriers,

588
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,000
 and we connect the children to God.

589
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,400
 And we want to do that, not only connecting them to God.

590
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,800
 The vision for our kids' ministry here is to connect them to God,

591
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,000
 to their peers, because they will grow up together,

592
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,200
 and they will walk together, but also to you guys.

593
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,400
 My volunteers, the lesson plan that I designed,

594
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,000
 always ask them to share their own stories,

595
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 because I want kids to know that

596
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,200
 being a Christian is not easy.

597
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,800
 It has challenges.

598
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,000
 And while you share your stories,

599
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,800
 they get to see what a real Christian looks like.

600
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,800
 That it is challenging, we fail, we are discouraged,

601
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,600
 but God always loves us.

602
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,000
 God will always help us.

603
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,400
 And through these stories,

604
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,000
 they get to know that there are people who love them.

605
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,600
 There are people in this community that they know.

606
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,600
 When they grow up and they start to rebel against their parents,

607
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,800
 because we all do that,

608
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,800
 they know that they can go to you for help if they need.

609
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,200
 And so, are you willing to open up yourself,

610
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,600
 and just to get to know the family,

611
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,800
 and get to know the kids, and share your stories with them,

612
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,800
 so that they grow up to be a person,

613
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,200
 to be in an environment and a community

614
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,000
 that will always point them to Jesus?

615
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,800
 Serving in K4C is not the only way,

616
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,600
 although it is the most direct way.

617
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,400
 And I really want to say thank you to all the K4C

618
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,000
 teachers and assistants,

619
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,200
 and people who have been serving in all the Kids Ministry events.

620
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
 I just really want you to give them a big hand.

621
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,200
 I am truly so grateful and so honored to work with these people.

622
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,600
 Each of the teachers and assistants

623
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,800
 really put in all their time, a lot of their time and energy

624
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,000
 into serving the children, into getting to know the Scripture.

625
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,200
 Every month, they would have to leave this hall

626
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,400
 where we can sit and enjoy and bring and bask in God's Word.

627
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,400
 And they go in and share God's Word.

628
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,400
 I remember a time when I was teaching the Bubbles class,

629
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
 the kindergarten class.

630
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,600
 There was one sermon where I was talking about

631
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,200
 Jesus healing the blind.

632
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,000
 And God spoke to me that day about God giving me an identity.

633
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,600
 And it was in those moments that I realized that

634
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,600
 when we're sitting here and we enjoy being in God's presence,

635
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,000
 the teacher and assistants there,

636
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,600
 God is using, they're speaking through them to the children.

637
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,000
 And I hope that if you are inspired,

638
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,600
 that you have an urge to do a little bit,

639
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,000
 feel free to let me know.

640
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,400
 But serving in K4C is not the only way

641
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,600
 that we can work with children together in this church.

642
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,400
 As I've said before, getting to know the families,

643
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
 supporting them, listening to them,

644
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,600
 is actually a great way and very important way

645
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,200
 to get to know the kids and to support the kids' ministry as well.

646
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,800
 And K4C needs your prayer.

647
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,600
 Our children need your prayer.

648
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,400
 Our family needs your prayer.

649
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,600
 So right now, I'd like the worship team to come up.

650
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,800
 And I'd like all of you to find two or three people around you.

651
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,200
 Or you can pray on your own,

652
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,200
 but I would love you to find two or three people

653
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,000
 to pray for K4C, our kids' ministry, and our children right now.

654
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,600
 So get connected.

655
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:10,600
