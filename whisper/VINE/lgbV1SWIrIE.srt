1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
 We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,020
 Thank you, church.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,840
 Thank you, worship team.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,660
 That was a beautiful time of singing

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,900
 and worshiping together.

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,740
 You may have a seat.

7
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,140
 As you sit down, there might be someone new next to you,

8
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,460
 so you can say hi.

9
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,560
 If you have some seats free next to you as well,

10
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,820
 just hold up your hand, let our host know,

11
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,900
 so that we still have some people that are standing by,

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,860
 wanting to get a seat.

13
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,860
 So if there's a seat free next to you,

14
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,140
 you can hold up your hand.

15
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,900
 Our host will come and fill up as many people

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,060
 as we can in this room.

17
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,500
 If you're in the overflow, a big welcome to you.

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,640
 Thank you for being here with us.

19
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,440
 And if you're joining us online,

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,420
 a very good morning from Hong Kong.

21
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,740
 Wherever you're joining us from, welcome as well.

22
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,220
 So we've kicked off this sermon series

23
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,460
 that we've called Uncharted.

24
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,240
 And actually, I figured something out.

25
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,400
 It's actually quite a good way to get away with stuff

26
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,580
 in the office these days, right?

27
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,620
 So for example, if you do something like,

28
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,100
 you know, go for a three-hour lunch,

29
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,520
 and you come back, and Carla's like,

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,360
 where have you been?

31
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,460
 It's like, oh, on a lunch.

32
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,300
 Say, what's three hours?

33
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,820
 Well, it's Uncharted, right?

34
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
 I mean, we've never taken three-hour lunches before,

35
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,540
 but now it's the way we're gonna do things.

36
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,740
 And so, just being cheeky.

37
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,700
 But you know, I figured it could be

38
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,260
 like a get-out-of-jail-free card sometimes as well.

39
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,220
 But we are, we're in this new sermon series

40
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,180
 we've called Uncharted, where we feel like God

41
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,380
 in this year has challenged us with a vision

42
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,360
 to go places we've never gone before.

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,420
 Right, no strategy, no knowledge,

44
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,340
 no necessarily any plans or steps

45
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,320
 that we are intending to take,

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,360
 but just be wide open in going

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,780
 where God is leading us to go.

48
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,840
 But a lot of that has to do,

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,500
 starts with the way we think, right?

50
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,280
 We have to be thinking right.

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
 We have to be thinking as God is thinking

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,640
 in order for go and do where he's called us to do,

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,340
 and go where he's called us to go.

54
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,520
 And our thoughts are with us all the time.

55
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,660
 You know, growing up, there's certain things

56
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,280
 I've realized now that have been so ingrained,

57
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,720
 like incepted into my mind that as I grew up,

58
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,560
 as an adult, as you live life,

59
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,040
 you realize actually has a bigger impact

60
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,560
 on you than you first realize.

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,000
 Right, some of these are funny and nonsensical, right?

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,840
 You probably have heard some of these things.

63
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,320
 For example, my mom and my grandma always told me

64
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,080
 that if you sleep with the fan on blowing in your face,

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,920
 right, you will suffocate and die, okay?

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
 I'm sure I'm not the only one

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,620
 that's been growing up with that thought, right?

68
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,180
 If you don't sleep with the fan on,

69
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,680
 it's gonna blow against your nose,

70
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,540
 and then the air, something happens, right?

71
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,440
 And then you will die in your sleep, okay?

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,120
 Another way, okay, another thing

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,480
 that my parents often told me was

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,440
 if you don't finish every single grain of rice

75
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,880
 in your bowl, okay, that's gonna be a mark

76
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,520
 on your future wife's face, okay?

77
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,760
 Now, my wife is sitting here right now.

78
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,880
 You can see no marks on her face, very pretty, okay?

79
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,800
 But, right, so I would eat all my rice, right?

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,760
 Am I right?

82
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,900
 You have to eat every single grain of rice, okay?

83
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,260
 And otherwise, you're gonna end up

84
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
 with a scarred-faced woman.

85
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,260
 So, growing up, I was always very hot and very full, okay?

86
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,300
 Now, I'm addicted to rice these days.

87
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,340
 You can ask my friends, like,

88
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,860
 if there's rice, I will always eat it.

89
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,820
 Right, so there's some funny ways, okay?

90
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,060
 But some of these other thoughts

91
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,660
 that I feel like were imprinted into my mind

92
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,740
 were slightly more damaging, right?

93
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,740
 For example, I developed a huge fear of making mistakes,

94
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,880
 right, because making mistakes often led

95
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,520
 to harsh punishment from my mom.

96
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,160
 And so, instead of admitting to mistakes,

97
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,280
 I would hide, I would lie to cover things up.

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
 But, of course, as you know, the more you hide,

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,560
 the more you lie, the bigger trouble I would get in

100
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,600
 in the end, and the more punished I would be, right?

101
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,140
 And I realized it started to affect

102
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,360
 the way I express myself, right?

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,040
 I began to believe that, you know,

104
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,720
 actually, I can't make any mistakes at all,

105
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,800
 so I have to keep everything hidden inside, right?

106
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,720
 I might feel this way, but I'm not gonna say it, right?

107
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,800
 'Cause I might be wrong, and if I'm wrong,

108
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,840
 then I'm gonna be punished.

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,560
 Now, I used to think everybody thought like this.

110
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,420
 This was just a normal way to function in life, right?

111
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,760
 Until after I got married, I realized,

112
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,400
 actually, I should say it was pointed out to me, okay,

113
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,140
 that this pattern of thought was deeply affecting me, right?

114
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,680
 Because 100% it affected the way I was communicating

115
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,640
 with Brittany and the quality of our marriage.

116
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,960
 Now, I will also say this, right?

117
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,200
 I love my mom deeply, and over the years,

118
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,080
 she and I have had some, started to have some

119
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,280
 really beautiful but hard conversations

120
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,560
 about the way she raised me, right?

121
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,920
 These healing and forgiving sort of conversations

122
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,280
 about my childhood and her childhood,

123
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,720
 and as we talked, I began to realize that the reason

124
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,640
 why fear was such a big part of my upbringing

125
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,080
 was because she was also raised in an environment

126
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,760
 where fear was even more deeply saturated

127
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,640
 into a background and punishment from my grandparents

128
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,120
 to her and her siblings, and so through a little bit

129
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,320
 of counseling to try and help me out, right,

130
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,560
 Brittany and I, I tried to express myself

131
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,480
 as best as I can these days.

132
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,880
 I tried to be intentional, not to let my own negative

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,160
 experiences now also shape the way I parent my two boys,

134
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,320
 but what I've come to realize is that for things

135
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,280
 to really change, I really have to go back to the source,

136
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,120
 right, and change the way I think, right?

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,400
 I have to tell myself, remind myself literally these days

138
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,320
 that it's okay to make mistakes, right?

139
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,600
 No one's gonna come at me with a feather duster

140
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,640
 for the bad thing that I did, all right?

141
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,920
 Now, this is just a personal example,

142
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,200
 but the point I'm trying to make is this, right?

143
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,440
 It's not very hard to see that our thinking patterns

144
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
 have a significant effect on our beliefs

145
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,640
 and how we live our life and our behaviors,

146
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,480
 all right, which is why with this vision

147
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,080
 that the Lord has given us to embrace the uncharted,

148
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,620
 to go forth into territory that we've never been before,

149
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,480
 we have to be open-minded, and if God wants to change

150
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,840
 the way we think, we have to let the Holy Spirit

151
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,160
 challenge us in our beliefs and challenge us

152
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,440
 in our behaviors and challenge us in our traditions

153
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,400
 to go where God wants us to go, right?

154
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,720
 We sang this just now.

155
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,800
 Shake up the ground of my traditions.

156
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,920
 Bring down the walls of my religion.

157
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,520
 Now, again, don't get me wrong.

158
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,520
 I'm not saying all religions and traditions are bad, right?

159
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,120
 There are lots of tenets of truth and traditions

160
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,240
 that play an important role in our faith, right?

161
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,400
 There's certain tenets and pillars of the Christian faith

162
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,440
 that I would say are definitely true

163
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,360
 and unshakeable and unmovable,

164
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,640
 and anyone who tells you anything else, it's a liar, right?

165
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,640
 For example, Jesus is the only way, the truth and the life.

166
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,360
 That cannot be changed, okay?

167
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,300
 That there is one God who exists as the Father and Son

168
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,720
 of the Holy Spirit, right?

169
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,560
 You will never change that.

170
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,880
 That's just a fact, okay?

171
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,260
 That Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life,

172
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,080
 died on the cross as a perfect sacrifice for our sins,

173
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,700
 was resurrected on the third day,

174
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,640
 and sits enthroned in heaven.

175
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,680
 He's coming back to restore his creation

176
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,280
 and judge the living and the dead.

177
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,480
 Okay, that is a fact that you can never change.

178
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,760
 We have God's word, these 66 books that God has given us

179
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,040
 as Holy Scripture.

180
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,160
 The words of this book will never change.

181
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,160
 No one can ever add or take away from this book.

182
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,620
 We have beautiful traditions like communion,

183
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,520
 which we celebrate every month, right?

184
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,560
 Some churches celebrate it even more, right?

185
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,360
 It's a reminder of God's love and sacrifice

186
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,760
 and his presence with us.

187
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,240
 We have baptism, where we publicly display our faith

188
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,080
 in Jesus.

189
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,120
 These are some traditions and things, part of our faith,

190
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,380
 that are unshakable, unmovable.

191
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,520
 On the other hand, though, we have to be careful

192
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,760
 not to let other things bind us so much

193
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,520
 that the new and fresh things that God wants us to do

194
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,720
 are hindered by these barriers that we put up in our lives.

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,680
 And unless we're willing to embrace God's way of thinking,

196
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,280
 we will never be like I've been saying,

197
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,920
 go where God is leading us to go

198
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,060
 and do what he's asking us to do.

199
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,520
 So the question we have to ask ourselves today

200
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
 is this, church.

201
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,880
 Are we open to changing our thinking?

202
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,420
 Are we open to changing our traditions

203
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,960
 whenever God challenges them?

204
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,960
 Now, this is a huge challenge,

205
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,880
 because most of us are comfortable with the way we think.

206
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,880
 Most of all, are comfortable with the,

207
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,160
 we think we're right all the time.

208
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,600
 For example, you know, after I got married,

209
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 did you realize that there is a correct way?

210
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,720
 I didn't think there was a correct way

211
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,760
 to put milk in the fridge, but apparently there is, okay?

212
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,640
 I didn't think there was a correct way to fold towels

213
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,280
 that stack up in the bathroom a certain way,

214
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,800
 but there is, guys, okay?

215
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,180
 No, I didn't, okay?

216
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,360
 But we develop these mindsets, right?

217
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,520
 We take, so ingrained in these traditions,

218
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
 we get rooted into habits.

219
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,080
 We become stubborn, and that becomes hard to change,

220
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,240
 especially maybe some of these things

221
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,040
 have offered us comfort and guidance in the past.

222
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,880
 We want to hold onto them so that we feel protected

223
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,240
 as we go into the future.

224
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
 But we've been saying, right, as we go into the future,

225
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,120
 we don't know what's going on.

226
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,440
 We don't know where God is leading us to go.

227
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,600
 So if we hold onto those things,

228
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,460
 we don't know if they're actually gonna be useful or not.

229
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,120
 And today, we're gonna be looking at a passage in Scripture

230
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,600
 and through looking at this story,

231
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,180
 I hope we can see that God, we realize that God

232
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,160
 is a God who's not afraid to challenge the way we think,

233
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,680
 to help us to break free from the things that hold us back,

234
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,780
 even if some of those things

235
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,360
 might have been good at one stage.

236
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
 If it's not fit for purpose now,

237
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,140
 God is challenging us to change the way we think

238
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,620
 so we can be the people he's called us to be.

239
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,340
 So let's open up God's word.

240
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,960
 You can listen to me or you can read on the screen

241
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,360
 or if you have your Bible, open that up.

242
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,160
 Acts chapter 10 is where we're gonna be.

243
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,000
 At Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius,

244
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,680
 a centurion in what was known as the Italian regiment.

245
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,880
 He and all his family were devout and God-fearing.

246
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,840
 He gave generously to those in need

247
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,580
 and prayed to God regularly.

248
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,800
 One day, at about three in the afternoon, he had a vision.

249
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,080
 He distinctly saw an angel of God who came to him

250
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,840
 and said, "Cornelius!"

251
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,800
 Cornelius stared at him in fear.

252
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,880
 "What is it, Lord?" he asked.

253
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,920
 The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor

254
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,080
 "have come up as a memorial offering before God.

255
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,980
 "Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon

256
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,560
 "who is called Peter.

257
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,620
 "He's staying with Simon the Tanner

258
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,960
 "whose house is by the sea."

259
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,400
 Now right away, I think what Luke's trying to do

260
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,040
 is get us to shift and change.

261
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,920
 He's challenging us to look at certain things

262
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,560
 with a different perspective.

263
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,320
 Let me explain what I mean.

264
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,560
 At this time, Israel was still under Roman rule

265
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,880
 and authority.

266
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,720
 And one of the things that Romans were most proud of,

267
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,400
 they were ruling over Israel at the time,

268
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
 they were the main authority,

269
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,080
 and one of the things that they were most proud of

270
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,560
 was their strong military power, their army.

271
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,600
 Now Cornelius was a big part of that army,

272
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,000
 a centurion in a very important city.

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,160
 So as a man, as a centurion in a place,

274
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,120
 accessaria, with an important port city,

275
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,280
 he had a good amount of influence, a powerful leader,

276
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,080
 and centurion means he had 100 soldiers under his control.

277
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,760
 And so we would expect him to fit the stereotypes

278
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,700
 of a Roman officer.

279
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,640
 And what were those?

280
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,160
 Well, they were known as being brutish and cruel,

281
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,560
 people who wouldn't hesitate to throw you in prison

282
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,800
 at the drop of a hat, to have you tortured,

283
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,160
 or even to have you killed if they didn't like

284
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,320
 the way you were doing something.

285
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,860
 As Romans, they would have worshipped pagan gods,

286
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,200
 other gods, not Yahweh, but their own gods

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,920
 and their own religion.

288
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,340
 So that would be the way that people would think

289
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,080
 about a Roman soldier or a centurion,

290
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,000
 someone in authority who is part of the Roman Empire.

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,580
 But this isn't what Cornelius is like at all.

292
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,360
 Instead, we are told that he is a God-fearing man,

293
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,940
 devout, he's generous to the poor,

294
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,640
 and very strikingly, they say he is a man of prayer.

295
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,240
 He prays to God.

296
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,100
 So what Luke is trying to do through this story

297
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,200
 is to help us open our eyes and open up our thinking

298
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,720
 a little bit, because it would be easy

299
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,520
 to have written Cornelius off and say to ourselves,

300
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,200
 there is no way a man could ever use,

301
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,680
 a god could ever use a man like that.

302
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,360
 A Roman soldier, an idol worshiper,

303
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,600
 he's cruel, he's unsympathetic,

304
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,560
 but what God is trying to say,

305
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,120
 I can use anybody I choose to use.

306
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
 One thing to remember is this,

307
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,400
 we are not told how Cornelius actually came

308
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,120
 to know who God was and to be so generous,

309
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,940
 to be so devoted to prayer.

310
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,840
 I don't think it would be too much of a reach, though,

311
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,400
 to sort of think that actually,

312
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,640
 Cornelius, too, had to go through a process

313
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,600
 of changing his mind, knowing his background,

314
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,680
 knowing the way he was raised,

315
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,160
 he was probably raised in a home

316
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,940
 that did not worship God, that was cruel,

317
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,480
 that was brutish, embracing all those stereotypes

318
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,360
 that he grew up with.

319
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
 At some point, he had to change his mind,

320
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,960
 saying I'm not gonna be like that,

321
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,100
 I'm not gonna be cruel, I'm not gonna be mean to people,

322
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,440
 actually, I'm gonna be generous, I'm gonna pray to God.

323
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,240
 He had a fundamental shift in the way he thought

324
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,960
 and in his beliefs.

325
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,520
 He had to make the big decision of pledging himself

326
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,560
 not to Caesar, right, that's how the Romans were prayed to,

327
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,320
 pray to Caesar, but to pray to Yahweh instead.

328
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,200
 You see, what God was doing,

329
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,040
 God had amazing plans for Cornelius.

330
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,720
 There was something he was trying to do through Cornelius,

331
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,640
 but first, he had to challenge Cornelius

332
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,820
 in his way of thinking.

333
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,480
 Now, as I was reading this, I felt like this was a word

334
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,080
 in season for us, in the way we look at our leaders

335
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,680
 here in Hong Kong, hear me out.

336
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,560
 Over the past few years, it's no secret

337
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,760
 that we have struggled at times,

338
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,360
 there's been a struggle between the city's leaders

339
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,200
 and the citizens, right, and perhaps certain decisions

340
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,160
 that have been made, right, it's easy to look at those

341
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,280
 in governing powers over us, to look at authority figures

342
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,040
 and think of them negatively, straight away, right,

343
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
 believing that they're all unkind,

344
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,000
 that they do not care about their citizens,

345
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,840
 that they're their own agenda in minds.

346
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,080
 But actually, I would say this is probably

347
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,240
 not just a Hong Kong problem, but all over the world,

348
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,800
 right, it's easy for us now to look at our earthly

349
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,520
 authority figures, people in government,

350
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,320
 people in authority over us, through a lens of disdain,

351
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,540
 much like a first century Jew might have looked

352
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,000
 at a Roman soldier, an officer, seeing them as cruel,

353
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,280
 barbaric, and unsympathetic, and because we think

354
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,720
 these things about them, we feel like we can't trust them,

355
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,280
 and we feel like we don't want to follow them,

356
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,500
 we think they're cruel and unkind.

357
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,960
 We don't want anything to do with them.

358
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,840
 But I felt like when I was reading this,

359
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,240
 God was challenging us to shift our perspective,

360
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,240
 especially to those who govern over us.

361
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,640
 Because what if, and not even what if,

362
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,360
 I believe, actually, that God is calling us

363
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,920
 to truly pray for those in authority over us.

364
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,320
 And for some of us, this is gonna take a big shift

365
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,680
 in our thinking, and a big shift in the way

366
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,820
 we believe things.

367
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,080
 But I think this, because as we pray for our leaders,

368
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,480
 as God has commanded us to do in scripture,

369
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,720
 perhaps God is also, at the same time,

370
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,100
 doing the work of raising up leaders, people in authority,

371
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,500
 right, authority figures, changing their hearts,

372
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,300
 changing their minds, like he might have done

373
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,360
 with Cornelius, who will then go on to live,

374
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,600
 to govern, to serve society in the way

375
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,000
 that God has called them to serve.

376
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,040
 And then we'll start to see the change

377
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,560
 that we've been all hoping to see.

378
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,320
 You see what I'm trying to say?

379
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,040
 So church, are we willing to change the way

380
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,960
 we think about leaders and those in authority over us?

381
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,520
 Are we willing to think and break out of those peoples

382
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,400
 that we've stereotyped as certain things,

383
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,880
 so that we can join in with God,

384
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,200
 and want the best for their lives, and pray for them,

385
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,320
 and as God changes and moves people

386
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,960
 in ways that we don't even understand how,

387
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,840
 we get to partner with God in shaping

388
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,080
 and providing hope for this world.

389
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,040
 So with this new way of thinking, Cornelius,

390
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,440
 like we say, these suddenly and immediate leaders,

391
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,160
 Cornelius suddenly receives a message from God,

392
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,520
 and immediately, he responds obediently

393
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,680
 to this mysterious message, right?

394
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,400
 Go to Joppa, find Peter, bring him back to me.

395
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,200
 And Cornelius responds immediately in obedience.

396
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,480
 It says this, Cornelius called two of his servants

397
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,360
 and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants, right?

398
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,960
 So three dudes, he says, he told them everything

399
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,520
 that happened and sent them to Joppa.

400
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,480
 Now at this moment, you have to realize,

401
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,560
 Cornelius has no clue what was going on.

402
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,600
 He's received a vision, an angel has come to talk to him.

403
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,440
 He's wondering, like, what is this all about?

404
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,000
 Who is this Simon Peter guy, right?

405
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,440
 Why is he at Simon the tennis house?

406
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,200
 Why is the name Simon so popular in this area, right?

407
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,120
 Why does God want him to bring me back here?

408
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,080
 There's no answers yet,

409
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,880
 but what we can see is faith and obedience.

410
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,720
 And as God shifts our thinking,

411
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,580
 we also have to ask ourselves these questions.

412
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,900
 Once he does that, are we willing to be obedient

413
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,820
 even when things aren't clear for us?

414
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,580
 Are we willing to do what God calls us to do

415
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,140
 even when we haven't seen the whole picture yet?

416
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,100
 Andrew talked a bit about this last week,

417
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,500
 but obedience is easy when we understand.

418
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,180
 True obedience though, is when we don't see it all,

419
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,340
 yet we are still willing to do it anyway.

420
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,540
 This is what it means to take a risk,

421
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,820
 to not rely on a strategy, to have total surrender to God,

422
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,740
 but it has to start with the way we think.

423
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,620
 Because most of us, like a plan of action,

424
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,060
 even myself, right, most of the time I'm flying

425
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,260
 by the seats of my pants, right, whatever you say,

426
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,100
 but, okay, even for myself,

427
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,460
 at least some guardrails are comforting sometimes.

428
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,740
 But are we willing, right, to break of our comfort zones

429
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,180
 of knowing every single step

430
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,880
 and to simply let God lead the way and have his way?

431
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,900
 And when we do this, church,

432
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,820
 we see amazing things begin to happen.

433
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,220
 Okay, check it out, this is what happens next.

434
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,660
 About noon the following day,

435
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,700
 they were on their journey and approaching the city.

436
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,940
 Peter went up on the roof to pray.

437
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,220
 He became hungry and wanted something to eat.

438
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,980
 And while the meal was still being prepared,

439
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,580
 he fell into a trance.

440
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,340
 He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheep

441
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,440
 being let down to earth by its four corners.

442
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,060
 It contained all kinds of four-footed animals

443
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,020
 as well as reptiles and birds.

444
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:46,060
 And a voice told him, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat."

445
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,980
 "Surely not, Lord," Peter replied.

446
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,620
 "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."

447
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,120
 The voice spoke to him a second time,

448
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,460
 "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."

449
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,580
 This happened three times.

450
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,300
 And immediately the sheep was taken back to heaven.

451
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,500
 So the story is beginning to emerge.

452
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,200
 Right now it's Peter's turn to have a supernatural encounter,

453
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,500
 to have a vision from heaven.

454
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,460
 Right, and in his vision, we see, right, a sheep,

455
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,500
 something like a sheep is filled with all kinds of animals

456
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,460
 and he's commanded to get up, kill and eat.

457
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,580
 Now, in our Chinese context, this sounds like a jackpot,

458
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,920
 right, like good porn toy, right, this is like a buffet.

459
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,400
 Right, as a Chinese person, it's kind of hard sometimes

460
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,140
 to imagine things we can and cannot eat, okay.

461
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,820
 So if we were to see a vision like this, right,

462
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,800
 God says, "Come on, kill and eat," right,

463
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,700
 it's like an invitation to a buffet.

464
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,640
 "Let's do it, come on, I'm excited.

465
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,660
 "I can eat anything I want," right,

466
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,160
 that's like the best deal ever, right.

467
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,900
 But Peter is not excited, right.

468
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,520
 He doesn't wanna go anywhere near that stuff.

469
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,920
 In fact, he almost sounds insulted

470
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,060
 that Jesus would ask him to do such a thing

471
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,940
 in the first place, right.

472
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,560
 Jesus was asking Peter, essentially,

473
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,040
 to break the food doors.

474
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,100
 All kinds of unclean animals that Jews were forbidden

475
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,940
 to eat were filled up in the sheet.

476
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,640
 Peter's like, "I've never touched those things, right,

477
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,920
 "from since I was a baby, I've been observing these laws,

478
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,600
 "right, these laws that have been passed down

479
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,260
 "from generation to generation since we've been freed

480
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,620
 "from slavery in Egypt up 'til now.

481
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,540
 "My parents, my grandparents, my great-grandparents,

482
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,260
 "we have all followed these laws.

483
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,900
 "Things have always been this way,"

484
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,400
 which is why Peter says, "Surely not, Lord.

485
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,540
 "I have never eaten anything unclean."

486
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,660
 And you have to realize that actually,

487
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,540
 this wasn't just about food laws, right,

488
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,980
 this was about identity.

489
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,800
 It was a matter of holiness, right?

490
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,380
 The food laws were part of the laws

491
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,180
 that set the nation of Israel apart from other nations,

492
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,980
 right, from Jews, from Gentiles.

493
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,520
 Gentiles means anyone who's not a Jew, right?

494
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,280
 So this is what it did for them, right,

495
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
 to set them apart, to keep them holy,

496
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,320
 to keep them protected from other nations.

497
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,780
 And Jews would look at all these unclean foods

498
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,620
 that the Gentiles would eat and would label them

499
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,460
 as evil and wicked for these unclean things

500
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,020
 that Gentiles would do.

501
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,060
 Us, as Jewish people, we don't do those things.

502
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,100
 And so when Peter says, "No, I'm not gonna do that,"

503
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,740
 you can sort of sympathize him a little bit, right,

504
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,080
 at first, to why he had that sort of reaction.

505
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,980
 Like I said, his whole life,

506
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,620
 this was ingrained to his beliefs,

507
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,000
 the importance of keeping up levitical law,

508
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,820
 certain rules, certain things, right,

509
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,460
 certain, and it wasn't just food laws as a whole,

510
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,460
 but 617 laws that they had to follow.

511
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,200
 It was part of their identity.

512
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,260
 Right, in fact, the food laws were particularly important,

513
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,700
 that they were revered in a way,

514
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,620
 some of the heroes of the Old Testament faith.

515
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,820
 Remember David and his three friends, right?

516
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,620
 They refused to eat the king's food,

517
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,340
 and in the end, they were commended

518
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,360
 as people who truly followed God,

519
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,740
 and God blessed them in a certain way.

520
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,220
 They were rescued by God

521
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,420
 precisely because they didn't break the food laws.

522
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,140
 So Peter was thinking, "I'm set.

523
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,060
 "These are things that can never be done.

524
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,200
 "Certain foods are prohibited by God.

525
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,140
 "I'm never gonna break that law."

526
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,940
 And for a time, like I said,

527
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,880
 that was needed, and it was right.

528
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,220
 But now what God was doing through this vision, right,

529
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,980
 even though Peter doesn't quite see it yet,

530
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,780
 he makes clear that there is now no distinction

531
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,140
 between Jews and Gentiles.

532
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,100
 God is using this picture of unclean food now made clean

533
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,060
 to pertain that the Gentiles too

534
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,100
 are included in God's plan.

535
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,420
 They've always been, right,

536
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,660
 that they're included in God's plan,

537
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,820
 that the Gentiles have been made clean.

538
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,740
 And so what this means now is for you yourself, Peter,

539
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,840
 as a Jewish person, you can now go and fellowship

540
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,420
 and do life and minister to these people.

541
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,420
 In fact, that's what I'm gonna call you to do.

542
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,660
 I am welcoming them fully into this family of God, Peter,

543
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,260
 and so should you.

544
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,660
 So Peter, put out your old way of thinking

545
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,280
 and be a part of what I'm trying to do now.

546
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,960
 This is what God is trying to say.

547
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,380
 In fact, he says it very clearly.

548
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,380
 "Do not call anything impure that God has made unclean."

549
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,140
 Like I said, it's more than just about food laws.

550
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,100
 It's not just saying to Peter,

551
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,140
 "Hey, go and eat tau siu fan right now, okay?"

552
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,860
 It's more than that.

553
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,340
 One level, yes, dig in, but like I said,

554
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,020
 he's trying to say there are no lines of boundaries now

555
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,220
 that once separated from you and the others.

556
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,700
 Jesus is drawing Jew and Gentile together,

557
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,060
 not moving past one to get to the other,

558
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,380
 not choosing one and rejecting the other,

559
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,140
 but bringing them together to draw close

560
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,420
 what was once far apart.

561
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:08,760
 When I was studying this, I may think, what about us?

562
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,060
 What are some ways in our society

563
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,820
 and these traditional ways of thinking

564
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,780
 that we have labeled other people as unclean

565
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,620
 and rejected them?

566
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,340
 What are some lines and boundaries within our own culture

567
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,980
 that we need to begin and start changing our thinking on?

568
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,220
 In many ways, what God was challenging Peter to do,

569
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,080
 similar what we're facing in Hong Kong today.

570
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,420
 Like Peter, for those of us who grew up in Hong Kong,

571
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,060
 we've grown up in sort of like a colonized environment,

572
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,820
 meaning we've always been under the rule

573
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,940
 of some sort of foreign power.

574
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,580
 But now that we're no longer accordingly,

575
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,100
 we've returned to our home country for some time now,

576
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,300
 but because we've been separated for so long,

577
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,820
 we don't really feel that connected as Hong Kongers

578
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,460
 to our roots and our origins.

579
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,900
 So we find ourselves, I feel like,

580
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,200
 in a bit of an identity crisis.

581
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,780
 We're not British enough to be British,

582
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,100
 we're not Chinese enough to be Chinese,

583
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,220
 so we have Hong Kong culture.

584
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,680
 And so as Hong Kongers, we're proud of this in many ways.

585
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,860
 I am so proud to be from this city,

586
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,580
 and it's such a beautiful thing.

587
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,240
 We have a rich diversity here in Hong Kong, don't we?

588
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,740
 Melting pot from people from all over the world.

589
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,020
 We can even see that reflected in this very room itself.

590
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,540
 But we've got Cantonese language,

591
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,920
 colorful, very descriptive.

592
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,900
 You could ask for a spoon and end up with a fork.

593
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,060
 Get one tone wrong, and it completely changes

594
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
 what you're trying to say.

595
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,140
 We have amazing food, vibrant, delicious,

596
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,220
 fusion foods from all over the world.

597
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,540
 You can have an amazing meal for $45,

598
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,540
 or you can have a good meal for $4,500.

599
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,160
 Either one, it's amazing and delicious, it's in own way.

600
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,380
 At the same time, though,

601
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,720
 because I feel like we have these struggles with identity,

602
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,160
 we've developed these sort of defense mechanisms,

603
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,000
 these barriers, these ways of thinking that we've put up

604
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,440
 that separates us from others.

605
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,880
 And these have developed into some unhealthy

606
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
 and prejudiced ways of thinking

607
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,780
 that we might view people in our city.

608
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,040
 So for example, when we encounter someone from the mainland

609
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,300
 as a Hong Konger, maybe one of our natural instincts

610
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,200
 is to think, oh, well, they're not really like us.

611
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,380
 We might look similar,

612
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,260
 but they don't really share in our culture.

613
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,460
 They don't really, you know, we speak a similar language,

614
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,900
 but it's quite different enough for us

615
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,740
 not to be able to understand each other,

616
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,100
 so we're not gonna engage with them.

617
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,720
 What about our foreign domestic workers?

618
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,600
 Well, these people might live alongside us,

619
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,200
 but really, they're just a worker in our homes.

620
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,420
 Right, we're the busy, successful Hong Kongers

621
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,080
 going about making money.

622
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,680
 We don't need to really engage with them.

623
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,600
 Right, and sometimes we don't even think of them

624
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,420
 and treat of them as members of society, right,

625
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,800
 since the pattern of thinking we've developed,

626
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,440
 their role is just to serve,

627
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,720
 and we fail to truly love, respect, and honor

628
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,040
 our foreign domestic workers, our helpers, and aunties

629
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,680
 who support our families so well.

630
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,360
 What about our other ethnic minorities

631
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,400
 that live in this city?

632
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,280
 Right, they too eat differently, dress differently,

633
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,740
 have languages that we don't understand.

634
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,080
 Again, but they haven't grown up here.

635
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,520
 But they're not really Hong Kongers,

636
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,260
 so let's keep them at arm's length as well.

637
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,760
 Now, we're in Hong Kong, I'm a Hong Konger,

638
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,780
 we're speaking in a very Hong Kong context,

639
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,360
 but if you're listening today and you're not from here,

640
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,760
 or you're listening from somewhere else,

641
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,820
 the idea is the same, right?

642
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,500
 You see what I'm trying to say?

643
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,760
 In your own context, in your own culture,

644
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,120
 what are these barriers that you've set up?

645
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,900
 What are these faulty ways of thinking

646
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,280
 that you've developed about other people,

647
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,280
 other cultures that are not like you?

648
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,100
 Well, what about when it comes to even in this gathering,

649
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,880
 our own church itself?

650
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,220
 Right, do we label people with certain sin struggles

651
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,840
 to be more unclean?

652
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,140
 Do we take a holier-than-thou approach

653
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,500
 to people struggling with certain sins?

654
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,300
 Do the barriers that we see in culture

655
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,660
 seep into our faith gatherings,

656
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,300
 so on the surface here, it might seem like

657
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,800
 everyone's getting along, raising their hands in worship,

658
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,020
 getting along, praising God together,

659
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,460
 but deep down, I would never go to this person's house.

660
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,300
 No way.

661
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,540
 That true connection is not there.

662
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:44,160
 These barriers break God's heart.

663
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,720
 It's certainly not how he thinks about things.

664
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,800
 And as we hold onto these old ways of thinking,

665
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,560
 we hold onto our prejudice,

666
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,440
 we are calling impure by our own judgment

667
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,600
 what God has already made clean.

668
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,620
 What are we refusing to change, church?

669
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,500
 But we know God has, deep down,

670
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,200
 we know that God has called us to change.

671
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,260
 These are the ways of thinking

672
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,940
 that God is challenging us in.

673
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,420
 And it's a beautiful thing

674
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,260
 when Peter realizes what's happening.

675
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,340
 When Peter realizes what Jesus is asking him to do,

676
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,000
 it's like a eureka, a ding, ding, ding sort of moment

677
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,840
 in his life, right?

678
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,420
 Listen to these words.

679
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,940
 I now realize how true it is

680
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,380
 that God chose not favoritism, listen,

681
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,860
 but accepts every nation who fears him

682
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,140
 and does what is right.

683
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,220
 You have to understand Peter's mindset from before.

684
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,820
 He became a man from so adamant, right,

685
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,620
 about not ever, he was a very stubborn man

686
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,020
 to changing his thinking

687
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,820
 into what God has been asking him to embrace.

688
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,780
 This is the beautiful thing

689
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,380
 about letting God do the thinking instead of us,

690
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,340
 because he's infinitely wiser,

691
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,340
 his perspective is infinitely wider than any of us.

692
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,540
 We find out, actually, this is what God has been working

693
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,140
 at the whole time, even though we don't know it.

694
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,100
 It took them to respond in change of thinking

695
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,940
 and their obedience.

696
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,120
 Now they see it, right?

697
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,340
 Last week, we realized that Peter

698
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,420
 and the Ethiopian eunuch wasn't a coincidence

699
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,260
 that they got together,

700
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,660
 but it was the Holy Spirit who was orchestrating.

701
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,980
 God was orchestrating the whole thing, right?

702
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,180
 Later on in the story of Acts,

703
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,620
 we have Saul and Ananias,

704
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,980
 two people that should never have been together,

705
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,100
 but God brings them together.

706
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,100
 And now we have Cornelius and Peter,

707
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,460
 two men who are willing to change the way they think,

708
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,640
 respond in obedience to God,

709
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,300
 and now God's gonna use them in a remarkable way.

710
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,900
 Like I said, the transformation that Peter has gone through

711
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,940
 is actually pretty remarkable,

712
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,160
 'cause Peter was always a person who thought he knew best.

713
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,380
 Last week, we figured out, right,

714
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,260
 Peter was the one who thought he knew better than Jesus,

715
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,340
 that planned for Jesus' life,

716
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,500
 until Jesus rebuked him to his face.

717
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,660
 Peter was, he thought that violence was the best way

718
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,460
 to stop the soldiers from worshiping Jesus.

719
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,300
 So what did he do?

720
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,460
 He took things into his own hand.

721
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,980
 When the soldiers were coming to arrest Jesus,

722
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,620
 he pulls out his sword, tries to cut the guy's head off,

723
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,740
 and said, "Just get his ear," right?

724
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,020
 He thought that was the right thing to do.

725
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,500
 But God told Jesus, says, "Not this way, Peter."

726
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,180
 Peter was so stubborn in his thinking,

727
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,020
 "I'm gonna be loyal to Jesus,

728
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,340
 "and even if it costs me my life,"

729
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,300
 only to deny his best friend hours after that.

730
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,500
 So Peter has gone through this journey

731
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,980
 in the way he was thinking,

732
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,300
 but there's one particular moment,

733
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,380
 you know, as I was reading this passage and thinking back,

734
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,260
 that I felt like Peter was probably thinking about

735
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,660
 when he came across this thought.

736
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,180
 Matthew 16, 19 tells us,

737
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,460
 when Jesus is having this conversation with Peter,

738
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,780
 he once said to Peter, "The keys to the kingdom of heaven

739
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,500
 "have been given to you."

740
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,580
 And I really wonder if Peter was thinking

741
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,420
 about that conversation when he realizes

742
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,460
 what's happening in this moment.

743
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,580
 It's God was saying, "Remember, Peter,

744
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,340
 "I gave you the keys.

745
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,380
 "You are the gatekeeper in this moment

746
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,780
 "of the kingdom of heaven.

747
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,380
 "I want you to take those keys, Peter.

748
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,180
 "I want you to open the gates and throw them wide open,

749
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,940
 "and now your job is to tell the whole world,

750
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,140
 "everyone who loves me is welcome in.

751
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,260
 "Doesn't matter if you're Jew,

752
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,780
 "doesn't matter if you're Gentile.

753
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,860
 "Open those gates, Peter, you have the key.

754
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,340
 "Your job is to tell the world who I am,

755
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,020
 "and let everybody into my kingdom."

756
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,740
 This is the new way of thinking that I'm challenging you with

757
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,580
 not just to the Jewish nation, but to everyone.

758
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,260
 And this is what Peter's life's changed.

759
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,460
 We see him launching into this mission,

760
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,060
 and he goes and he starts spreading the gospel.

761
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,700
 He starts with Cornelius and his family.

762
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,740
 He starts sharing with them the gospel,

763
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,380
 telling them who Jesus is.

764
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,820
 Even though they love God, they haven't yet met Jesus,

765
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,300
 and so in this moment, Peter shares the gospel

766
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,580
 with Cornelius, his family.

767
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,980
 He starts to tell them about his death and his resurrection,

768
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,340
 the forgiveness of sins that come through believing in him.

769
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,060
 And Peter has fully embraced his thinking

770
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,380
 that everyone who gives their life to Jesus

771
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,380
 is welcome into his kingdom.

772
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,620
 All the barriers now, the very fact that he's in Cornelius'

773
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,700
 house itself already means that his thinking

774
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,100
 has been changed.

775
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,780
 But this is the most amazing thing.

776
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,380
 An astonishing thing happens here.

777
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,820
 Peter didn't even get to finish his message,

778
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,980
 because at that moment, the Holy Spirit falls.

779
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,460
 And Cornelius and his family begin speaking his tongues,

780
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,860
 and they're baptized fully into God's family.

781
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,700
 But we saw this happening earlier, actually,

782
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,860
 in the book of Acts, on the day of Pentecost,

783
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,220
 when the disciples themselves were filled

784
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,740
 with the Holy Spirit.

785
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,820
 Now it's the Gentiles' turn, the non-Jewish family's turn,

786
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,380
 to receive the Holy Spirit.

787
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,300
 This is God's final confirmation of the picture.

788
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,260
 This is truly what I'm trying to do.

789
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,620
 Everyone now is welcome into the kingdom of God.

790
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,900
 This is for real.

791
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:22,900
 All this was possible,

792
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,180
 because Peter was willing to think differently.

793
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,500
 He was willing to put down his traditions, his culture,

794
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,500
 so he could respond to what God was calling him to do.

795
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,700
 He could have been stubborn.

796
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,740
 He could have been stuck in his ways.

797
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,900
 When he saw that sheet, he said, "I'm not gonna do that.

798
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,100
 "I'm gonna keep to my lane.

799
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
 "I'm gonna stay what I'm doing.

800
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,180
 "You go find someone else to do this."

801
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,540
 But notice, that's not what happens.

802
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:54,500
 He responds by changing his thinking in obedience to God.

803
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,460
 Notice, this is always about God's work.

804
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,140
 It's not that Peter changed his thoughts

805
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,100
 in somehow orchestrated events.

806
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,940
 It's not that he saw,

807
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,860
 it wasn't just a random vision in the sky

808
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,780
 that he responded to it.

809
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,820
 This was God challenging him to his way of thinking

810
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,780
 into ways he never thought about himself,

811
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,740
 but responding in obedience

812
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,300
 to what God was calling him to do now.

813
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,900
 And as we look, this is very typical

814
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,540
 of the way God works across the Bible,

815
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,460
 helping people change their perspective,

816
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,540
 change their thinking,

817
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,700
 so he can respond in obedience to him,

818
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,500
 and then they can do what he's called them to do.

819
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,380
 For example, Moses.

820
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,260
 Moses always thought he wasn't a good speaker.

821
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:40,260
 I don't have the words, I'm not a good speaker, Lord,

822
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,140
 but God used him to speak to Pharaoh

823
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,220
 and set his people free from slavery.

824
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,340
 Gideon thought to himself,

825
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,140
 I'm the smallest dude from the smallest tribe,

826
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:55,140
 the big army before me, how can I ever defeat them?

827
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,700
 God shifts his perspective, changes thinking,

828
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,220
 and with just 300 men, Gideon defeats the enemy army.

829
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,940
 The woman at the well thought Jesus was there to condemn her

830
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,940
 just like everybody else.

831
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,540
 She thought, I'm no longer worthy of society,

832
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,660
 I have to come out here in the heat of the day

833
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,820
 just to get some water, I have no place in society anymore.

834
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,540
 But as she encounters Jesus, her perspective changes,

835
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,980
 and she goes back and evangelizes

836
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,900
 the entire region of Samaria.

837
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,540
 You see how now it's not our role to think up strategies,

838
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,620
 to come up with ideas, to come up with plans,

839
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,940
 to figure things out, God has already done that for us.

840
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,780
 All he asks us to do is shift the way we think

841
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,260
 so that we can walk in obedience

842
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,660
 and then he can use us to do the things

843
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,500
 that he has called us to do.

844
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,860
 It's all about being obedient to Christ.

845
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:55,100
 So let me give us a few guidelines from scripture

846
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,260
 as to how we can switch our minds

847
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,140
 so we can be more obedient to the things

848
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,220
 God is calling us to.

849
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,540
 Number one, 1 Corinthians 2, 16,

850
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,380
 scripture tells us to do this,

851
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,380
 to put on the mind of Christ.

852
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,180
 This means that we don't think like the world thinks,

853
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,100
 but rather we put on the mind of Christ,

854
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,620
 we're saying that we think like Jesus would think.

855
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,940
 We approach things from a godly perspective, right?

856
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,900
 We set our minds on the things that are what?

857
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,740
 Above.

858
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,260
 And as we do this, scripture tells us

859
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,460
 we can't do this by our own experience.

860
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,180
 We lean not on our own, what church?

861
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,180
 Understanding.

862
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,860
 But submit all our ways to him, that's Proverbs 3.

863
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,980
 We embrace the wisdom of God,

864
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,500
 we trust that God's way are not our ways,

865
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,580
 his thoughts are what?

866
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,740
 Higher than our thoughts, Isaiah 55.

867
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,980
 You see, if we do things,

868
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,660
 if we keep just thinking in our own ways

869
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,140
 and doing things our own ways,

870
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,740
 we're only ever gonna get earthly results.

871
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,180
 But when we shift our thinking

872
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,060
 and respond in obedience to God,

873
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,060
 we get godly, heavenly, supernatural results.

874
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,940
 We do not conform to the pattern of this world

875
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,940
 that the Bible tells us, but our minds are transformed,

876
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,580
 we are transformed by the renewing of our minds.

877
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,660
 Then we will be able to test and approve what God's will is,

878
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,860
 his good, pleasing, and perfect will, right?

879
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,740
 To obey him, to walk in the way he wants us to walk,

880
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,260
 Romans 12.

881
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,580
 We take every top cap to the make it what?

882
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,980
 Obedient to Christ.

883
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,740
 This is what I mean when we say

884
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,780
 we need to change the way we think, right?

885
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,060
 It's not about mustering up more willpower,

886
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,060
 it's not about manifesting, okay,

887
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,300
 don't come at me with that, okay, into reality.

888
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,020
 It's not about setting a more positive mindset even,

889
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,060
 it's about changing your thinking

890
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,060
 so you can be obedient to God

891
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,940
 and walk in the way that he's called you to walk.

892
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,900
 This is what it means to change our thinking.

893
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,420
 And when we do this,

894
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:10,140
 when we do this, the world truly begins to change.

895
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,540
 When we have a church that's filled with people

896
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,260
 who are thinking right, guided by God's wisdom,

897
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,700
 obedient to what Jesus has called us to do,

898
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,700
 empowered by the Holy Spirit,

899
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,380
 boldly going into these uncharted areas

900
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,860
 that we've been challenged to go,

901
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,420
 the places in our community,

902
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,500
 we bring down the strongholds

903
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,740
 that have been taking other people captive.

904
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,380
 We can say amen to that, yes?

905
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,540
 Imagine what it would be like.

906
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,820
 Our city is so stuck in the ways of thinking,

907
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,020
 some of the things that we see in our society

908
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,220
 that we've sort of given up on.

909
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,340
 But if we go together,

910
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,260
 if we're obedient to what Jesus has called us to do,

911
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,300
 and we start to bring a new perspective

912
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,700
 to some of these strongholds,

913
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,100
 think what would happen.

914
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,740
 So the thought in the city that money is more important

915
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,620
 than everything else,

916
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,980
 from God's perspective that looks like,

917
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,820
 you know what, I'm gonna teach people

918
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,180
 and teach myself to put God first.

919
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,580
 Right, the thought that you need to be a certain position

920
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,700
 to be considered somebody becomes God loves you

921
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,660
 and values you and cherishes you unconditionally

922
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,060
 no matter who you are.

923
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,220
 This thought that we need to put this immense pressure

924
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,380
 on our kids to be high achievers

925
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,220
 and have all these academic achievements

926
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,340
 becomes Jesus wants you just to have childlike faith.

927
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:34,260
 The thought that this city can never be evangelized

928
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,820
 because people are too busy chasing the Hong Kong dream

929
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,460
 becomes with God all things are possible.

930
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,180
 The idea that separation and separation is a reality

931
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,500
 that people will never be truly united

932
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,540
 becomes in Christ there is slave nor free,

933
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,060
 Jew nor Gentile, male or female.

934
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,180
 This pandemic that we see with our young people

935
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,620
 giving up hope, turning to drugs and suicide, right,

936
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,820
 the generations of Hong Kong have no hope

937
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,580
 becomes you, oh Lord, are my hope and my salvation.

938
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,140
 The thought that the idols of the city

939
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,380
 will always have a foothold,

940
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,420
 that will never break free from the things

941
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,540
 that hold us back from really following God

942
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,980
 become Jesus is the way, the truth, and the?

943
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,900
 The idea that there's families,

944
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,900
 there's children out there that need families

945
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,020
 out there right now, foster care and adoption,

946
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,980
 and that they will always be stuck in this situation,

947
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,900
 that generations upon generations of fatherlessness,

948
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,180
 of parentlessness becomes look after the widows

949
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,980
 and the orphans, and a group of Christians

950
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,580
 will rise up to that challenge,

951
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,540
 and every single child can be placed

952
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,300
 into a home that loves them.

953
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,460
 Come on, church.

954
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,300
 Let's not sit back and be defeated by our thoughts.

955
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,980
 That's what the enemy's trying to do,

956
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,620
 is to try to confuse our way we think,

957
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,540
 but this is a call to rise up,

958
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,820
 change our thinking, change our perspective,

959
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,860
 ask God to give us a new mind and a new heart

960
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,740
 so we can walk in obedience to him,

961
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,780
 and be the people he's called to be,

962
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,660
 do the things that he's called us to do,

963
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,020
 defeat and claim back some of these uncharted areas

964
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,500
 that the enemy has taken for the glory of God.

965
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,540
 This is how we bring the light of the gospel into the city.

966
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,980
 Jesus had made all things clean.

967
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,540
 Our job now is to bring things back into his presence.

968
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:23,140
 Do the work of reclaiming city in the name of Jesus,

969
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,020
 and it starts with the way we think, church.

970
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:31,740
 So let us give it a moment.

971
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:37,260
 Close your eyes right now for a second, if you would.

972
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,420
 (silence)

973
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:53,660
 I understand that it is a process,

974
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,140
 and trust me when I say I've been there.

975
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,340
 Some of these old thoughts keep popping up in our minds,

976
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:03,700
 and it's hard to break free from our negative thoughts

977
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,180
 and the way we think about things.

978
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,820
 It's hard to break free from some of these traditions

979
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,820
 that we hold on so strongly to.

980
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:24,900
 But as you sit there at the moment,

981
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,940
 just allow the Holy Spirit to bring those things up to you.

982
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,460
 What are some of these faulty ways of thinking

983
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,660
 that you've embraced,

984
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,020
 and what are some of these faulty ways of thinking

985
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,620
 that have been holding you back

986
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:44,860
 from being obedient to Jesus,

987
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,700
 to do what he's called you to do?

988
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:52,940
 For some of us, those things might be rooted

989
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,620
 in trauma and abuse and pain.

990
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,380
 And our prayer there is that you would find the help you need,

991
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,380
 that Jesus would set you free from those experiences,

992
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:19,780
 and so that you know that you are safe in Jesus' hands,

993
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,580
 that he will never lead you anywhere

994
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,060
 that is gonna be harmful for you as a person,

995
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,940
 but he has the best plan for you.

996
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:36,060
 Maybe for some of us, we feel like we're useless.

997
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,900
 That's a thought that's been ingrained in our mind.

998
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,780
 "Ah, it's no use."

999
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:48,580
 "I'll never amount to anything anyway,

1000
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,620
 so what's the point in trying?"

1001
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:55,020
 And to you, I feel like the Holy Spirit would say,

1002
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:00,860
 "I created you.

1003
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:06,700
 I created you for good works that only you can do,

1004
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,020
 and you have a place, a task, a mission in my kingdom."

1005
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:19,340
 For some of us, it might be traditions

1006
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,540
 that from our family that have been passed down

1007
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,860
 through generations like Peter.

1008
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,860
 Maybe saying yes to being obedient to Jesus

1009
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,820
 might mean it seems like it's completely turning your back

1010
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:35,260
 on everything you've known and to the beliefs of your family.

1011
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:41,700
 But look what happens in this story.

1012
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,020
 Cornelius' entire family was changed because of his faith.

1013
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,220
 And so I pray for courage for those in those areas,

1014
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,620
 that you would have wisdom to know what it means

1015
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,380
 to share your faith with your family.

1016
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,620
 And maybe through you, just as it happened

1017
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:08,020
 to Cornelius' family, everybody would begin to praise God

1018
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,020
 and be baptized, and the Holy Spirit would reign

1019
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,180
 over you and your loved ones.

1020
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,860
 All I know is I don't know how God is exactly going to work.

1021
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,020
 This is what, you know, the amazing thing

1022
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,220
 about the unchartedness of what we're going forth into,

1023
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,980
 but I see in this room a group of people

1024
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,180
 who are at least interested in coming on a Sunday

1025
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,020
 and worshipping, and so you know something of who Jesus is.

1026
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,500
 And you've heard a message like this today.

1027
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:46,460
 Maybe just your one prayers,

1028
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,460
 "Okay, Lord, help me change my mind.

1029
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,380
 "And whatever you want me to see,

1030
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:57,020
 "however you want me to think, open my eyes to those things.

1031
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:02,860
 "And give me a heart that is obedient so I can walk in those."

1032
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,380
 So I'm going to ask us if that is you,

1033
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,420
 if you are willing to be challenged by Jesus

1034
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,900
 in the way you think, to shift your perspective,

1035
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,740
 for you to be challenged in the way you live,

1036
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,980
 for your hearts to be made more obedient to Him.

1037
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:25,220
 You can rise up to your feet at this moment,

1038
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:29,540
 just as a prayer, as a response to what God is calling us to do.

1039
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:35,140
 If you're ready for that, just stand up.

1040
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,500
 That's all it takes, as a response.

1041
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,580
 And that's just you saying,

1042
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,180
 "Jesus, I am willing to be obedient."

1043
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,580
 And I see, I hear church rising to their feet now.

1044
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,180
 "So Lord, would you take our prayer,

1045
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,580
 "would you take our hearts, would you take our minds?

1046
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:56,780
