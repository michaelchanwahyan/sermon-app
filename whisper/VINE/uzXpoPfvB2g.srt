1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 Well, we've had a great series over the month of October into November called The Remedy

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,840
 for Relationships, as we've looked at different elements of our relationships and those broken

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,420
 relationships in our lives and how we can strengthen them.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,600
 And I'm really excited.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,840
 We got Pastor Ellison finishing off the series with us today.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,080
 Can we put our hands together for Ellison as he comes?

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,280
 I really want to honor this man.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,560
 I was going to be away for the month of October in Egypt filming for our Exodus series, and

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,760
 I asked Ellison to curate a series, come up with it, to put it together biblically, to

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,840
 talk to all the speakers, train them, get them ready, comment on their sermons, prepare

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
 them to preach.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,400
 And this man's done the whole series.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
 It's been fantastic.

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,960
 Can we honor him in that?

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,600
 And why don't we stretch out our hands?

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
 Let's pray.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,640
 Father, I'm very grateful for Ellison, Brittany, Isaiah, for this family amongst us.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,700
 And Lord, as Ellison comes and brings a message that I know is deeply in his heart, Father,

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,460
 we open our hearts now to what You want to say to us about our families.

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,400
 We recognize the joy of family and the struggle at times of family.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,680
 And we pray that You would come by Your Spirit and just teach us today, both through the

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,760
 Scriptures but also through Ellison's example in his life of how we can be better equipped

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,400
 to serve the most important relationships that are around us.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 And we thank You for this in Jesus' name.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,800
 Everyone says, "Amen."

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 Amen.

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
 Thank you, Andrew.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
 Good morning, church.

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
 It's always good to be here.

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,440
 And Yuen Long crew, and online if you're watching, Yuen Long, we are having the first gathering

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
 in Yuen Long right now.

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,000
 They're having a barbecue and live streaming the sermon, I believe.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,560
 So yeah, that's very exciting for our church as we launch, start launching our way into

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,320
 Yuen Long and all that God's doing there.

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,480
 So yes, as Andrew's been saying, we spent the past few weeks exploring different faucets

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,000
 of relationships.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,920
 We've looked at how we can sacrificially give of ourselves, be a good neighbor to the ones

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
 around us.

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,800
 We looked at humility and how that countercultural it is in a city like Hong Kong.

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,120
 We've talked about reaching out for others in the gospel.

42
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,960
 Do we hide Jesus under a bushel or do we let Him shine in our lives as He's supposed to?

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,360
 We're talking about, we've talked about as a community, how do we relate to each other

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,640
 in our relationship with the Lord?

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,480
 And then last week, Carla talked to us about being reconcilers.

46
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,180
 You know, are we willing to be reconciled to those who are different or even at animosity

47
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,560
 with us?

48
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,920
 And it's been a good journey for me.

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,640
 I hope it's been a good journey for you too.

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,800
 It's been a great honor working with my colleagues and building the sermon series.

51
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,320
 And so we do round up today by looking at family relationships.

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,080
 I'm going to tell you something by saying this, something mysterious.

53
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,800
 So I daydream a lot, always daydream about the most ridiculous things.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,400
 I dream about myself being like a UFC champion and, you know, all that kind of stuff, grappling

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,720
 John Jones and choking him out.

56
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,240
 I dream about receiving phone calls for some reason.

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,280
 I always think, you know, when I pick up the phone, someone's going to call me and be like,

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,960
 "Ellison, yes, we need you at the airport within the next 25 minutes.

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
 Should you wish to confirm?"

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,880
 You know, and then I'll be there at the airport and they send me on some special mission.

61
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,240
 You know, but it gets me thinking, the ring of a telephone is one of the most mysterious

62
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,120
 things in life, right?

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,520
 Because you can never really guarantee what you might hear on the other end.

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,080
 We might have a good idea, for example, if my wife calls me around 4 to 5 p.m. in the

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,200
 evening, I can almost guarantee that the conversation is going to go like, "Hey, what do you want

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
 to eat?"

67
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
 "I don't know.

68
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
 What do you want to eat?"

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 "I don't know.

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
 What are you going to eat?"

71
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,240
 Until I correctly guess what she wanted to eat and we go and eat that, okay?

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,200
 Thirteen years, it's been the same conversation.

73
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,160
 But you never really know.

74
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,800
 You never really know until you actually pick up the phone and every now and then you get

75
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,200
 one of those phone calls that completely changes the trajectory of your life.

76
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,120
 A few years ago, I got one of these phone calls.

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,480
 So my wife, Brittany, and I, we just finished going through the process of becoming Project

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,360
 Bridge parents.

79
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,040
 Now Project Bridge is a program by Mother's Choice that trains people to be foster care

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,920
 families, to train up people to be foster care families so you can receive children

81
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,560
 in your home, make sure they have a safe, healthy place until they're matched into their

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,720
 forever families.

83
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,400
 And so we did the training because, you know, we had fostered a few children in the past,

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,080
 three other children in the past.

85
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,200
 We'd received them in their home and provided some foster care for them.

86
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,600
 But we'd never done any official training for that.

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
 So we thought, "You know what?

88
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,760
 We'll do the training.

89
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,600
 It seemed like a good thing to do and in case the need comes up again in the future, we

90
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,480
 would be able to do that."

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,580
 But we never really expected the need to come up.

92
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,280
 And so when we got the call that there was a one-month-old baby that needed a foster

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,440
 home, to be honest, our reaction was a bit more like, "Oh, actually, I don't know."

94
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,240
 I mean, we didn't know how long this child would be with us.

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,960
 We had very little information at the time.

96
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,320
 And you know, things were going well for us.

97
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,580
 We were living smoothly.

98
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,180
 We had holidays planned.

99
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,080
 The home was nice and calm and tidy.

100
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,900
 We had no major responsibilities.

101
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,760
 We were enjoying what you call dink life.

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,680
 Do you know what dink means?

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,240
 Double income, no kids.

104
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,440
 Perfect, right?

105
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,400
 We could just do whatever we want, whenever we wanted, not accountable to anybody.

106
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,360
 And so receiving a child into the home just seemed like a giant disruption that we weren't

107
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
 ready to engage with.

108
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,520
 But when we got this phone call, it just so happened that it was during the Justice Conference,

109
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,280
 the last Justice Conference we had in Hong Kong.

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,460
 And it just so happened that one of the keynote speakers at that Justice Conference was a

111
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,020
 man called Dr. Krish Kandai.

112
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,020
 And Krish Kandai, he lives in the UK, amongst many other things, has a huge heart for foster

113
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,020
 care and adoption.

114
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,660
 He himself welcomes many children into his home, has adopted many kids, and that was

115
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,060
 exactly what he was talking about, the importance of foster care and adoption.

116
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,740
 Now during that session, you know, I was running around doing different things.

117
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,100
 Brittany and I weren't sitting together, but our reaction was exactly the same.

118
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,140
 Tears down our eyes, we kind of found each other in the hallways, "Okay, let's do it,

119
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,140
 let's do it, honey.

120
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,660
 Yes, Jesus, we'll take this child, whatever it takes, we're going to do it."

121
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,740
 And soon after that, we received baby Sam into our home.

122
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,420
 This is baby Sam right here.

123
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,820
 He was one month old from when we joined our home.

124
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,300
 We picked him up from the hospital.

125
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,820
 And so what followed was the most amazing nine months of looking after Sam, watching

126
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,580
 him grow up, teaching him new things, celebrating his milestones, Christmas, Chinese New Year,

127
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,240
 visit to Disneyland.

128
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,100
 We did all the things you would expect a family to do.

129
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,220
 And I had no idea I could love a child I had just met so deeply.

130
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,620
 I mean, from the moment I met baby Sam, I was done.

131
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,380
 I held him in my arms, picked him up from the hospital.

132
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,040
 It was like my heart was completely there with him.

133
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,700
 But also during that time, we had to wrestle with a lot of questions.

134
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,820
 People asked us questions like, you know, or gave us advice, very bad advice, like,

135
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,460
 "Oh, you know, don't get too attached to him because it's going to be very sad when you

136
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,460
 have to let him go."

137
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,140
 "Oh, it's going to be so difficult.

138
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,020
 Do you guys think you can cope?"

139
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,540
 Or, "How are you going to give him up in the future?"

140
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,360
 You know, by the way, we never gave him up.

141
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,660
 Never use those terms when you talk to foster care and adoption children, okay?

142
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,260
 We're not giving children up.

143
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,220
 They're being placed, adopted into a new home.

144
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,800
 People would say things like, "Oh, I could never do that.

145
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,300
 It would be too much."

146
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,260
 But from our perspective, really, in the end, it wasn't even a choice.

147
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,860
 If this child was going to be in our home, if we had said yes, we were going to love

148
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,640
 this child with our whole hearts.

149
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,300
 We were going to form good, healthy attachments to him and let him form good, healthy attachments

150
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,580
 to us because this was the way this baby was going to learn what love is.

151
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,260
 And I can honestly say Brittany and I, without any holding anything back, love that child

152
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,340
 with our whole hearts, even though we knew his time with us would be temporary.

153
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,020
 And not a lot of people in this room right here were part of that journey, walking alongside

154
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,700
 with us, supporting us in our journey with baby Sam.

155
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,500
 Did we think we could do it?

156
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,580
 No.

157
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,540
 Was it too much at times?

158
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,540
 Yes.

159
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,380
 But was it worth every ounce of our effort, love, and tears?

160
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,380
 Absolutely.

161
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,380
 100%.

162
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,660
 Okay, so why am I telling you this story?

163
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,220
 Well, a couple of things.

164
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,900
 Firstly, November is Adoption Awareness Month.

165
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,220
 All over the world this month, people and organizations are promoting the importance

166
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,460
 of foster care and adoption.

167
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,220
 And in Hong Kong, right at this moment, there's a huge need for this.

168
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,620
 A news article came out not too long ago, you might have seen it, that said, "Over the

169
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,300
 next few years, because of all the disruptions and all the families leaving that we've had

170
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,340
 during protests and COVID and all the things we've been facing in this city, there's going

171
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,100
 to be a 20% reduction," they believe, "in the amount of foster homes that are available

172
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:08,020
 for children, leaving kids in need in a very vulnerable position."

173
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
 But this is it, church.

174
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,900
 This is where we have an opportunity to step up and literally make a dramatic, life-changing

175
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,460
 difference in the lives of these children.

176
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,620
 So the first thing I want to urge us today is this, ask ourselves this question, "Has

177
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,260
 the Lord called you to adopt children?

178
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,600
 Has the Lord called you to be foster parents, giving kids a safe home to live in before

179
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,400
 they are adopted into their forever families?

180
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,220
 Or what else can I do to support this area of life?"

181
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,740
 If even if you just have a little bit of an inkling, if you're just a little bit curious,

182
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,180
 don't ignore that.

183
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,380
 Be curious, as Carla said last week.

184
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,340
 After all, this is literally a mandate from God.

185
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,220
 God commands us to do this.

186
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,140
 One James 2:7, "Religion that our God, our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this,

187
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,100
 to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself being polluted

188
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,660
 by the world."

189
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,700
 So find out more.

190
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,180
 Ask people that have gone through that journey.

191
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,380
 There are many families in our community that have gone through that, including Pastor Andrew

192
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,460
 and Chris, and they would be more than happy to sit down with you to tell you about their

193
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,560
 adoption journey and what God has placed on their hearts in this.

194
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,460
 Because I'm not kidding when I say if the church got the act together, if followers

195
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:32,220
 of Jesus really came together to do this, we could literally see every single child

196
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,860
 in this city adopted or fostered in safe, healthy families.

197
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,860
 That's a reality.

198
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,460
 That's a goal that can actually be met by the people of God.

199
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:50,420
 So think about this church and ask God, "What have I been called to do in this area?"

200
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,540
 But as I was reflecting on this fact too, there's a deeper sort of theological truth

201
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,140
 that comes into mind and that convicts me as I look at this.

202
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,960
 And to explore a bit more about that, we're going to turn to Galatians chapter 4.

203
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,460
 So if you can follow on the screen or if you have a Bible with you, you can open up to

204
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,180
 Galatians chapter 4, verses 4 to 7.

205
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,460
 Let me read this for you.

206
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,740
 It says this, "But when the set time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman,

207
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,300
 born under the law, to redeem those under the law that we might receive adoption to

208
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,000
 sonship or daughtership.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,100
 Because you are His sons and daughters, God sent the spirit of His Son into our hearts,

210
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,360
 the spirit who calls out, 'Abba, Father.'

211
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,300
 So you are no longer a slave but God's child.

212
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,880
 And since you are God's child, He has made you also an heir."

213
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,760
 You see, we just talked about these vulnerable children who are in need of homes, in need

214
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,180
 of someone to come and welcome them into a loving, safe family.

215
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,340
 But sometimes also we forget, actually we don't forget, maybe we talk about this, we

216
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,100
 don't really absorb this, that if it wasn't for Jesus and what He had done for us on the

217
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:11,260
 cross, we too would be in the same position, vulnerable, hopeless, in need of a family.

218
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,220
 And this is precisely why Jesus was sent by God onto this earth.

219
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,740
 God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law so

220
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,060
 that we might receive what?

221
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,540
 Adoption to sonship or daughtership.

222
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,260
 God sending His Son was not an accident.

223
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:36,740
 It was done with a plan and a purpose, for His intention for God to become our heavenly

224
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,140
 Father, for that relationship to be reconciled.

225
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,700
 God sending His Son means that our sin no longer separates us or estranges us from Him,

226
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,540
 but rather we are adopted into His family.

227
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,860
 God sending His Son was a way of His demonstrating His unconditional, very real love for us.

228
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,820
 Before we did anything, God sent His Son to save us, to adopt us into His family, and

229
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,300
 He continues to love us no matter what.

230
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,340
 So yes, you and I are just as much as in need of these children I was talking about earlier,

231
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,020
 to be adopted into a family, but into the family of God.

232
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,220
 And so when this happens, there's a powerful and fundamental change in your identity and

233
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,220
 the trajectory of your future.

234
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,820
 When we become sons and daughters of God, because of this, we are granted this special

235
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,340
 level of closeness and intimacy in our relationship with Him.

236
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,460
 We got a glimpse of that just now as we were worshiping together.

237
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,580
 Because we are sons and daughters, He sent His Spirit to us, the Spirit who calls out

238
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,960
 Abba, Father.

239
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,900
 We are no longer slaves, but we are children of God, and since we are His child, we are

240
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,820
 also heirs.

241
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,880
 So I admit it, growing up in a more conservative, traditional background, I would get really

242
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,900
 weirded out when people would call God an Abba God or Daddy God.

243
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,340
 It's always sounded strange to me.

244
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,400
 I'm still getting used to it.

245
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,340
 But it did make me think about this.

246
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:12,700
 You see, one of the awkward things in our journey with fostering Sam was the fact that

247
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,140
 we had to come up with something that he could call us.

248
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,260
 Because baby Sam had his biological parents.

249
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,900
 He also had a family that he was preparing to be adopted into, and we were sort of in

250
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,980
 this interim period.

251
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,780
 So what do we call ourselves?

252
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,840
 We weren't mom and dad.

253
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,380
 So in the end, we came up with Daddy Elle and Mama Britt, and like I said, we would

254
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,700
 call him Baby Sam.

255
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,940
 We thought that was close enough without crossing any lines or becoming anything inappropriate

256
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,840
 or anything like that.

257
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,020
 But it was tough, I tell you.

258
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
 It was really tough.

259
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,020
 I mean, it might sound silly, but every time I held Sam, every time I hung out with him,

260
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,620
 every time I would go home to him, I would so badly want to say, "Hi, son.

261
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,140
 Daddy's back."

262
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,140
 But I couldn't say those words to him.

263
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,240
 But here's the thing.

264
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,860
 When it comes to our relationship with God, there are no such barriers of intimacy because

265
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,540
 we have been fully adopted into God's family.

266
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,460
 You are so much adopted that He's willing to give you His inheritance.

267
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,600
 You are an heir to His kingdom.

268
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,220
 So we sit right here today as sons and daughters of God, fully loved, fully accepted, filled

269
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,820
 with the Holy Spirit, which is the promise of God's presence with us, His intimacy with

270
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
 us.

271
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,340
 These things give us full permission without hindrance to approach God and call Him Abba,

272
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,620
 to call Him Daddy.

273
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,860
 This is the equivalent of Daddy.

274
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,020
 Abba is equivalent of Daddy.

275
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,740
 And in Jesus' day, you would use this with a father no matter what your age.

276
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,960
 It wasn't necessarily a small child talking to its father.

277
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,000
 It wasn't a status of your age, but rather the status of your relationship and your intimacy

278
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,200
 with your father that you would call him Abba.

279
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,480
 So this is our identity.

280
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,600
 And yes, we talk about it, we sing about it, it makes us feel good and safe to embrace,

281
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,080
 and so it should.

282
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,740
 As a follower of Jesus, this is your number one identity.

283
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,820
 What you stand on, what you build your life upon, what you build your faith upon should

284
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,400
 be the fact that you have an unbreakable relationship with Jesus.

285
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,160
 But here's the other thing.

286
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,160
 On the other hand, if we really want to embrace this, then I believe there are certain conditions.

287
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,800
 I mean God's love for you is unconditional.

288
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,880
 Yes, I believe that strongly, but the conditions, I mean that it should change the way we function

289
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,600
 as human beings, as children of God.

290
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,620
 It should change the way we approach all our relationships, including the relationships

291
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,080
 we have with our earthly family.

292
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,880
 God has a huge heart for families because God longs to see the generations praising

293
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,400
 His name.

294
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,880
 God sees the importance of families, and this is why fostering adoption is so important

295
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,600
 because He knows children grow, thrive, and live the best when they're in good, healthy,

296
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,080
 loving families.

297
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,800
 And we're sons and daughters of God.

298
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,560
 We are brothers and sisters with each other, yes, but we're also sons and daughters here

299
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,760
 of our parents.

300
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,920
 We refer to each other as brothers and sisters in Christ, but we also have our own brothers

301
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
 and sisters.

302
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,600
 And we call the church the bride of Christ, but we, some of us here, are here with our

303
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,560
 spouses or we have our own spouses that we relate to as well.

304
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,000
 So church, let me ask this question, how are those relationships going in your life right

305
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,180
 now?

306
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,480
 I ask this because I know from my own personal experience, the ironic thing is that it's

307
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,900
 possible that we might feel our relationship with God is thriving and doing well, we have

308
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,320
 a great relationship with our church family, but meanwhile, our relationships in our own

309
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,780
 homes and families are broken and tense.

310
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,200
 And since I'm standing here with you right now, let me give you an example of that.

311
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,700
 You guys see me week after week, I host services quite often, I get to preach sometimes.

312
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,720
 I've met with a lot of you here for lunch, dinner, coffee, we've prayed together, we've

313
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
 served God together.

314
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,720
 And I think I've done an okay job at this.

315
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,200
 I mean, I'm still working here right now, haven't been let go yet.

316
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,400
 Most of you here, I think, have a pretty good impression of me.

317
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,920
 But you know, sometimes I wonder, actually, it's not even really wondering, I know, that

318
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,600
 if you ask my wife, if you ask my sister or my brother, if you ask my mom or my dad, the

319
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,220
 answer might be quite different.

320
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,060
 The patience that I give so freely to you guys, it's not always the same patience that

321
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,160
 I share with my wife or my son.

322
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,280
 The generosity of the spiritual insights or advice that I give to you guys, my brother

323
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:58,260
 and sister might scoff at because they don't really see that side of me that often.

324
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,800
 And I get it, right?

325
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,840
 Family relationships are hard.

326
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,760
 And working on these relationships is probably one of the most challenging things that we

327
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
 can do.

328
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,880
 And for some of us, relationships within our families are wounded and scarred by serious

329
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,800
 abuse because the ones we thought would love us and protect us have turned out to be the

330
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,280
 ones to hurt us the most.

331
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,380
 And hear this very carefully, church, if this is the case, like Carla said last week, safety

332
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,260
 is the priority.

333
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,480
 This is not a call to return into an abusive situation.

334
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,580
 I cannot stress that more clearly.

335
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:40,480
 But good, healthy families are essential to God's plan of redemption.

336
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,320
 Spouses that love and respect each other.

337
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,200
 Children who honor their parents.

338
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,400
 Parents that empower their children.

339
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,080
 Siblings that have each other's backs.

340
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,400
 We need to build healthy families because healthy families are one of the ways God is

341
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,740
 going to demonstrate His love for the world.

342
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:03,520
 Healthy families literally have the power to transform entire societies.

343
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,280
 During the protests and the pandemic, we've heard from so many people, one of the areas

344
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,200
 that struggled with immediately that felt the strain of these things happening was the

345
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,760
 area of family relationships.

346
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,840
 It was as if, you know, things were already tense, put into a pressure cooker, and what

347
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,860
 came out was just a huge mess.

348
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,720
 So we have a chance to redeem this because God cares about families.

349
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,040
 Scripture is full of instructions about how God wants the family to work.

350
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,120
 And I understand also, yes, each family unit might look quite different.

351
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,680
 And your family structure might not be the same as, you know, what the traditional, whatever

352
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,480
 that is, family structure is.

353
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,320
 So I apologize we don't have time to get into every single nuance of families right now,

354
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,400
 but I really do hope that you get the heart of what I'm trying to say today.

355
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
 So we're going to turn back to Scripture.

356
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,940
 We go now to Colossians chapter 3, starting in verse 18 to verse 20.

357
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,400
 Let's look at this.

358
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,840
 It says this, "Wives, submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord.

359
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,040
 Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.

360
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,040
 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.

361
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,360
 Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged."

362
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:32,440
 So verse 18, "Wives, submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord."

363
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,200
 Okay, I know how this sounds.

364
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,720
 A married pastor up here spouting about submissive wives, okay, hear me out.

365
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,520
 I know, okay, the word submit can start feelings and images of harsh dominance and resistance.

366
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,280
 And throughout history, we must acknowledge that there has been a lack of protection for

367
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,080
 women's rights and women's empowerment.

368
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,780
 And it's a battle that we still have today.

369
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,780
 But hear me also in this.

370
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:05,280
 This verse isn't talking about husbands giving some sort of authority to dominate over the

371
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
 wives.

372
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,500
 It's not saying that.

373
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,640
 This isn't a call for wives to attend to a husband's every whim and wish.

374
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,680
 This isn't a scripture about women don't have a place or don't have their own opinions.

375
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,080
 This isn't a scripture to say that women are wives are second class in comparison with

376
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,160
 the roles of their husband, okay?

377
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,600
 It's not saying that.

378
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,640
 The model for this submission here isn't determined by the husband's dominance.

379
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,840
 Rather, the submission of Jesus to the Father and submission of the church to Jesus is the

380
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,600
 model of what real submission looks like.

381
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,160
 So submission is not really about dominance.

382
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,840
 Submission is about creating a beautiful partnership of mutual accountability between husband and

383
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,500
 wife, not the superiority over one and the other.

384
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,400
 So what does this look like?

385
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,720
 A few keys here.

386
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,480
 Firstly, it's this.

387
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,280
 Submission comes voluntarily.

388
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,320
 This is a challenge for you wives.

389
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,400
 But you have to choose to engage in this.

390
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,680
 Okay, please again, don't misunderstand me.

391
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,200
 It doesn't mean giving up your rights, giving up your worth, giving up your dignity.

392
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,520
 Choosing to engage, choosing to submit means actually taking a position of humility.

393
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,920
 Learning how to be patient with your husband.

394
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:33,680
 Sharing with him, supporting each other along the way, learning to forgive and listen well.

395
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,080
 This is the posture of humility.

396
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,840
 A good picture of this is what we see at the beginning when God created Adam and Eve, right?

397
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,760
 God created Adam and gave him Eve as a what?

398
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,320
 As a helper to work alongside him to support each other in that journey, not as someone

399
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,440
 that Adam could demonstrate his authority over.

400
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
 Second thing is this.

401
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,640
 Submission, it says, goes only as far as is fitting with the Lord.

402
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,920
 Because ultimate authority always belongs to Jesus.

403
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,480
 And wives are called to submit only as far as is appropriate for a follower of Jesus

404
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,120
 to do so.

405
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,440
 Which is why the second thing Paul goes on to say is this.

406
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,640
 Husbands, love your wives.

407
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
 So this proves my point.

408
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
 It's interesting, right?

409
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,640
 If Paul was talking about male dominance, if Paul was really concerned about the man

410
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,960
 being in charge of everything the wife does and all that stuff, he probably would have

411
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,520
 said, "Husbands, dominate your wives.

412
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,360
 Tell them what to do."

413
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,000
 But he doesn't.

414
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 The core here is to love.

415
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,800
 And you have to understand, actually this was super counter-cultural in the context

416
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,000
 that Paul was ministering.

417
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,080
 Because in those times, love wasn't even considered necessary as a part of a marriage relationship.

418
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,920
 But God realizes that in order to build healthy families, the driving force must be love.

419
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,800
 So this is why he says, "Love your wives.

420
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,200
 Do not be harsh with them."

421
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,140
 To not be harsh with our wives means that we don't treat them like subjects.

422
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,980
 To not be harsh with our wives means holding no bitterness against them.

423
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,740
 This is the root of the word harsh, it actually refers to bitterness.

424
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,200
 So what does bitterness look like in a husband's relationship to the wife?

425
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,440
 Well I think for me, at least in my understanding, it comes this.

426
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,840
 Bitterness comes when husband starts to blame the wives for things.

427
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,600
 Bitterness comes, we build bitterness in our wives when there's finger pointing.

428
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,640
 Bitterness comes when we project our failures onto our wives.

429
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,960
 Bitterness comes when we have unrealistic expectations of our relationship with our

430
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,140
 wives.

431
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,480
 So the core here is to love.

432
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,160
 But not just any kind of love.

433
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,520
 Sacrificial love.

434
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,040
 The same love that Jesus showed the church.

435
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:01,160
 Husband, love your wives as Christ loves the church.

436
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,400
 And how did Christ love the church?

437
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,480
 So much so that he was willing to die for the church.

438
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,840
 Give up everything to redeem the church.

439
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,600
 And just as the wives looks to Jesus as an example to submit, the husband looks to Jesus

440
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,140
 as a model to love.

441
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,880
 And how did Jesus love?

442
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,080
 Ultimately, Jesus loved through great sacrifice.

443
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,600
 So this is a strong challenge, husbands.

444
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,440
 It's almost as a verse is saying, if a wife wants to see what the love of Jesus looks

445
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,760
 like, a good thing, a good example of that should be the husbands.

446
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
 And this is a model.

447
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,240
 This is a model, an ideal for a good, strong, healthy marriage.

448
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,640
 And when we have a good marriage, within a marriage, sometimes children are involved

449
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,680
 also.

450
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,200
 And so Paul gives some instructions to that as well.

451
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,920
 Paul goes on to say, "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the

452
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
 Lord."

453
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
 Okay.

454
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,520
 I get it also.

455
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,600
 When we use the word obey, again, it conjures up uncomfortable feelings.

456
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,760
 I mean, obey?

457
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
 Really?

458
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,120
 Maybe for young children, of course, you don't really know how to think for themselves.

459
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,320
 But you know, I'm a grown up.

460
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
 I'm a grown person.

461
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,160
 You know, do I still have to obey?

462
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,880
 In fact, when do we start becoming a child?

463
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,960
 When do we start becoming a child?

464
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,680
 When does that status change?

465
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
 I mean, maybe we don't.

466
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:35,360
 I mean, if we always want to embrace our role as a child of God, then we're always our parents'

467
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,040
 children too, aren't we?

468
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,080
 No matter how old we are.

469
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,080
 I mean, as we grow and mature, our relationships, our parents might change, but your status

470
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,520
 as a child is not bound by age.

471
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,960
 And so often I find this hard to remember for myself as well.

472
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,760
 I find myself getting annoyed and frustrated at my parents.

473
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,400
 You know, "Don't tell me what to do.

474
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,080
 I'm a grown man.

475
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,840
 I'm guilty of this all the time.

476
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,520
 I'm getting better, but I still am.

477
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,160
 A lot of the time when my mom calls, I just go, you pick up the phone.

478
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,840
 I know what she's going to say too."

479
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
 Uh-huh.

480
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
 Yeah.

481
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
 Okay.

482
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
 Okay.

483
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
 Okay.

484
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
 Okay.

485
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
 Okay.

486
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
 Okay.

487
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
 Okay.

488
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
 Okay.

489
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
 Bye-bye, you know, and that's it.

490
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
 My aim is not to engage with her.

491
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,680
 Okay, moms out there, okay?

492
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,320
 My aim is to get her off the phone as fast as I can so I can return to what I'm doing.

493
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
 Right?

494
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,320
 It took my mom almost going to be with Jesus last year for me to start shifting my attitude

495
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,520
 towards that.

496
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,920
 So what does it mean to obey as children from one to 99?

497
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,880
 What does it mean to obey our parents?

498
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,720
 There's three things here I want us to do in an effort to enjoy and to be a better children

499
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,880
 of our parents.

500
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,440
 The three things are this, hearing, understanding, and responding.

501
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,160
 So hearing.

502
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,000
 Hearing is when we open our ears to what our parents have to say to us.

503
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,840
 Hearing means you remain in a posture of receiving when your parents are trying to talk to you.

504
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,680
 Responding means you refrain from talking over them, from allowing them suitable time

505
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,280
 and space to express themselves.

506
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,340
 And this might not be easy, right?

507
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,520
 You might have to learn how to hold your tongue.

508
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,600
 You might have to learn how to control your anger.

509
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,480
 But we must be able to hear our parents because without hearing, we cannot move on to step

510
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,840
 two, which is understanding.

511
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:39,040
 Understanding is a process of being able to fully put yourself in your parents' shoes.

512
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:45,880
 Understanding is the ability to practice empathy, to look at situations from your parents' perspective,

513
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,960
 to put down your own defenses and agenda.

514
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,520
 Let me give you an example from my own life again.

515
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,000
 My dad and I, I think we have a good relationship.

516
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,320
 We hang out, we go and eat.

517
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,800
 We used to do a lot of trail running together.

518
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:05,020
 He is an excellent dad, a man of honor, a man of integrity, a man of generosity.

519
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,580
 But at the same time, growing up, I would admit I had a bit of a chip on my shoulder.

520
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,920
 You know, because I would watch all these American movies where the dad would be like

521
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,440
 super affectionate, right?

522
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,640
 You get this, "Hey, sport, come over here," you know, and he like rubbed the child on

523
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,120
 the head and give him a hug, say, "Okay, now, go get them, son."

524
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,400
 And the son would be like full of confidence all of a sudden, right?

525
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,160
 And go out there and do a slam dunk and hit the home run and everybody would be cheering

526
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,920
 and like dad would come out again and hug them and it just looked like such a perfect

527
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,640
 picture of what a father was like.

528
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,440
 And I would feel resentful because like my dad's never said those things to me.

529
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
 My dad has never told...

530
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,040
 I've never heard the words, "I love you," come out of his mouth.

531
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,960
 He's never given me a hug like that.

532
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,440
 And I admit I would start to get resentful.

533
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,960
 Well, how come my dad doesn't love me in that way?

534
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,200
 There was a particular point in time where I became really angry about this amongst other

535
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,500
 things.

536
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,720
 There was a time of my life where as a young adult, I'd just come back to Hong Kong.

537
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,440
 I was working through a deep season of depression.

538
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,760
 I felt like nobody cared about me.

539
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,320
 I felt like my dad was just being silent, ignoring me because he wouldn't engage with

540
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:15,160
 me in conversation about my feelings until one night we were cooking dinner and my mom

541
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
 talked to me.

542
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,960
 I'll never forget what she said.

543
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,600
 She said, "You know what?

544
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,640
 You know, your dad has noticed that you've been acting different recently.

545
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,820
 He's noticed that these days you're sad and he thinks you're going through a season of

546
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:32,020
 depression and he's been praying for you.

547
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,020
 He hasn't eaten...

548
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,300
 He's fasted for the past three days.

549
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,820
 He hasn't eaten a single thing for three days because he's been fasting and praying for

550
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,820
 you."

551
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,540
 I think I just wanted to know that, son.

552
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,740
 I had no idea that was what he was doing.

553
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,740
 And I got to think about it.

554
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,660
 You see, what I failed to understand was my dad and his brothers never grew up with their

555
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,660
 dad.

556
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,460
 But his dad died when he was just a toddler.

557
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,400
 My grandma raised six children on her own, single-handedly.

558
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,900
 He never had his dad around.

559
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,980
 He didn't have anyone to show him that kind of affection either.

560
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,380
 And after coming to that understanding of where he was coming from, it helped me to

561
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,040
 show honor and respect and to obey him better.

562
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,180
 So we must seek to understand.

563
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,780
 The final thing is this, responding.

564
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,020
 Now responding is very different to reacting.

565
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,420
 Reacting is almost like a reflex, right?

566
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,660
 Someone pinches you, you say, "Ow."

567
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,820
 Someone punches you, you turn the other cheek, right?

568
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,260
 Okay.

569
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,060
 Reacting is just instinctual.

570
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,340
 In this context, reacting is when your parents talk to you, you just come back with whatever

571
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,340
 you want to say that comes out of your mouth first.

572
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,340
 That's reacting.

573
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,380
 And often reacting is not helpful.

574
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,700
 But responding.

575
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,780
 Responding is what happens when we've gone through the process of hearing and understanding.

576
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:55,900
 So that when we speak, our words, as Paul tells us later, can be full of grace, seasoned

577
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,200
 with salt.

578
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,460
 Responding is opening up to your parents, being able to have civil, calm conversations,

579
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,040
 even on things that you might not agree with.

580
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,700
 Responding is an act of love and honor to your parents.

581
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,740
 Now, just as children are called to love and honor and obey their parents, parents are

582
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,340
 now called to do the same for their children.

583
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,340
 Let's read on.

584
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:30,620
 "Fathers or mothers, parents, do not provoke your children, least they become discouraged."

585
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,100
 Okay, this is a word for you parents.

586
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,100
 This is your turn.

587
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,020
 You guys were nodding your head, looking at your kids.

588
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,060
 We're talking about obedience, okay?

589
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,940
 Now here's a word for you.

590
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,940
 Because there's mutual responsibility here.

591
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,340
 And let me start by saying this.

592
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:52,100
 We have to realize, parents, being a kid these days in Hong Kong is really, really tough.

593
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,300
 It's no secret that almost from the day kids are born, we're born into a system that forces

594
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,220
 kids to achieve from the time they're barely even able to walk.

595
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,820
 You have to get into the right nursery so you get to the right kindergarten so you get

596
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,500
 to the right primary school to get to the right high school, to get to the right university

597
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,900
 so you can get the best job that you can.

598
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,460
 So when you're still like pooping in your nappy, you're already being forced to make

599
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,780
 life-changing, life-directing decisions from the time you're a baby.

600
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,500
 It's a ridiculous system that a two-year-old has to go through an extensive interview to

601
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,180
 enter into a school, okay?

602
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,160
 Now again, don't hear me wrong.

603
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,580
 I'm not anti-education.

604
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,900
 I'm not saying that.

605
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,340
 I'm not saying we shouldn't challenge our children to do hard things, to achieve, to

606
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,580
 study hard.

607
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,260
 All these things aren't bad in and of themselves.

608
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,980
 But what an awful lot of pressure it is for a child to force them into doing things to

609
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,980
 go through that kind of system.

610
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,180
 Add this to the pressure, kids, from social media these days.

611
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,540
 When I was growing up, there wasn't much social media.

612
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,020
 I didn't grow up with smartphones and all that kind of stuff, so I can't even imagine

613
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:10,820
 the impossible challenge of relating yourself with all these things you see on social media.

614
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:16,020
 The very real, but behind-the-scenes cyberbullying that a lot of kids are going through.

615
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,620
 The extracurricular activities that we force them to go through.

616
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,340
 And recently, the changes in school schedules, in school, out of school, all these kind of

617
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,420
 things.

618
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,300
 Being a young person in Hong Kong is a difficult road.

619
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,300
 So parents, let's take what scripture says here seriously.

620
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,820
 Do not provoke our children.

621
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,260
 The word provoke is called eretizo.

622
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,140
 It means to make them become resentful.

623
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:50,420
 So parents, in your effort to teach and educate your children, we have to be careful that

624
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,820
 we too are respecting them as individuals.

625
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,140
 One of the most amazing things about how God made us is that we are all unique.

626
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,620
 We are all worthy in their eyes.

627
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,700
 God loves us, and his love of us doesn't change no matter what.

628
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,620
 God's favor upon his children is not tied up to what they can achieve.

629
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,300
 So why do we sometimes place these expectations on our kids?

630
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,560
 You know, Chinese parents, I know I'm stereotyping here, but one thing that bugs me so much every

631
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:27,300
 time I hear it, when I hear the words from a parent to a child, "Ah, you're useless."

632
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,620
 You are useless.

633
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,100
 Parents say this all the time in this city, and it's a problem.

634
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,220
 We need to stop tying up our children with what they can achieve.

635
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:42,380
 But did you know a recent study showed that only half of secondary school students in

636
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,940
 Hong Kong show signs of depression?

637
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:50,740
 Seventy percent of students in Hong Kong reported that they have a bad relationship with their

638
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
 parents.

639
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,060
 This should break our hearts.

640
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:59,380
 It should really make us think as parents, ask ourselves, "How do we contribute to this?

641
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,540
 And how do we demonstrate God's love to our children?"

642
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,660
 So here again are a few suggestions.

643
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,080
 Get to know your child.

644
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,420
 As the parent, yes, you are the parent, but how well do you truly know your child?

645
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,980
 How much time are we spending with them?

646
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:20,300
 Asking about their interests, asking them about their feelings, their hopes, their dreams.

647
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,660
 These are great conversations to engage with your child regularly.

648
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,660
 Acknowledge their efforts.

649
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:33,900
 Again, achievement is not a bad thing in itself, but when everything is tied up to achievement,

650
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,800
 that becomes a lot of pressure.

651
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,280
 When our kids do good things, yes, let's celebrate it.

652
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,700
 Don't just take it for granted.

653
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:48,140
 But when they fail to achieve our expectations, celebrate their efforts.

654
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,860
 Tell them, "Well done."

655
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,940
 Tell them, "Good job."

656
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,440
 Challenge and teach them to try again.

657
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,420
 And let's never use shame to motivate our children to do better.

658
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:07,500
 God never puts us to shame, so we should never do this to our children as well.

659
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,340
 Finally it's this.

660
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,700
 Remind them of their worth.

661
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,280
 Children need to hear that they're good enough.

662
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,980
 They need to be reassured that their worth is never and will never ever be tied up with

663
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,740
 what they can do.

664
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,060
 They need to know that failing is okay, that it's not the end, but rather we learn from

665
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,000
 our failures and we move on.

666
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,700
 And ultimately as parents, just as husbands and wives are called to demonstrate an example

667
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,700
 of the gracious love of God to each other, when your child looks to you, our goal for

668
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,980
 them is to give them a glimpse of what the Father's love for us might look like.

669
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,880
 And here's the really beautiful thing.

670
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,280
 When families are working as God intended them to work, when husbands and wives are

671
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,680
 loving each other, when children are obeying their parents, parents are empowering the

672
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,480
 children, God is pleased.

673
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,680
 And the generations are blessed through such families.

674
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,940
 Deuteronomy 7, 9, "The Lord your God is your God.

675
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:12,240
 He is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those

676
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,000
 who love him and keep his commandments."

677
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,860
 God is faithful to building healthy, good families.

678
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,600
 Let me show you how by tying this all together.

679
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,440
 I started this message by telling you about baby Sam, our foster baby.

680
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,240
 Well, like I said, about nine months with us, he was matched to a family and we had

681
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,920
 the privilege of going through the gut-wrenching, heart-wrenching process of helping him transition

682
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,500
 out of our home into his forever family.

683
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,720
 And saying goodbye to baby Sam will forever be one of the hardest things that we've ever

684
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,160
 had to do as a family.

685
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,820
 But you know what?

686
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,240
 Throughout this process, we had one prayer.

687
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,160
 Our prayer was that Sam would be adopted into a loving, healthy family and that somehow

688
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,680
 we would be able to stay in touch and be a part of his life.

689
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,600
 Well, just like God showed us his love by adopting us into his family, Sam was adopted

690
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:16,000
 into the most perfect, beautiful family that I believe God was preparing for him.

691
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,240
 He has parents that love him so well that are raising him up.

692
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:28,480
 What might have been a story of brokenness has transformed into a story of redemption.

693
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,000
 But here's something even cooler.

694
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,160
 Not long after Sam left our home, God gave us our own child, Isaiah, whom I hope we're

695
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,720
 raising in a family that's filled with love and the presence of God is this as well.

696
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,400
 And God answered our prayer.

697
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,680
 He gave us even more than we could imagine or ask for.

698
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,280
 He even answered our prayer by allowing us to stay in touch with Sam and his family.

699
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,640
 And here's this picture of Sam now as a grown boy praying with our boy, Isaiah, just a couple

700
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,280
 of months ago.

701
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,520
 Look at those cheeky faces, right?

702
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,540
 God loves families.

703
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:16,440
 He loves your family and he wants to see the brokenness in your family healed.

704
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:23,880
 He wants to see the generations of his love being passed down through the generations.

705
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,520
 So my prayer is that every family here today, no matter what it looks like for you, would

706
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,240
 truly know God and his love.

707
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,280
 I pray that we would learn how to love our family members and that we would find the

708
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,640
 remedy of a broken relationship within our families through loving each other as God

709
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,240
 has loved us.

710
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,420
 And that through this, God would display his faithfulness through the generations until

711
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,200
 he returns or takes us home.

712
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:03,360
 So church, I wonder if you would stand with me.

713
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,680
 If you're here with your family today, maybe this is an opportunity just to hold each other,

714
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,920
 get close to each other right now, you know, with your spouse or with your kids.

715
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,900
 I encourage you to do that.

716
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,960
 But I also know there might be people in today with, who don't have their families here with

717
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,120
 them, or maybe your family aren't here, or your earthly family is gone, you don't have

718
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,680
 an earthly family.

719
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:32,920
 Or maybe like earlier I was saying, it's been so estranged, it's been a background of abuse,

720
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,120
 it's been a background of deep hurt.

721
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,440
 If that's you, maybe grab some of your brothers, sisters in Christ around you and have them

722
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,800
 surrounding you right now.

723
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,440
 Because there's families here going through the process of praying for children and wanting

724
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,720
 to have children but haven't been able to do that.

725
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,560
 And God sees your pain in that as well.

726
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,580
 Like I said, there's a whole variation of things, and I'm sorry I can't be able to touch

727
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,700
 on everything, but God knows.

728
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,800
 God knows what your family is like.

729
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,480
 But God loves your family so deeply.

730
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,600
 As we pray, we remember, you know, in the Bible it's full of examples of broken families,

731
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,680
 of messed up situations, but God always somehow in the end redeems them by His wisdom and

732
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,520
 His love.

733
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,280
 So let me pray for us.

734
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:43,680
 Our Father in heaven, Lord we thank you that you are the true Father.

735
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,440
 That all of us have a place in your home.

736
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:56,360
 That nobody has been given up by you, but rather Lord you love us deeply, adopting us

737
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:01,860
 into your household, redeeming us by your blood.

738
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:06,800
 Every single person in this room can call out to you, "Abba, Father, today, because

739
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,120
 of your love for us."

740
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,600
 And we thank you for that.

741
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,960
 Father, I pray that this same love that you've given to us, Lord, would permeate every single

742
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:25,440
 home, every single family, every single situation right now.

743
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:34,760
 That we would learn to love as you have loved, especially those in our family.

744
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,680
 And that from this, Lord, from healthy, good families, from children being placed in homes

745
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,080
 that are safe and an environment where they can thrive, Lord, you are changing the world

746
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,880
 by your love in this way.

747
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,600
 And that the generations to come would have stories of praise, would have testimonies

748
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,240
 of healing and of redemption because your love was at work in their families.

749
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,520
 So we pray for ourselves, we pray for our parents, we pray for the generations to come

750
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:11,400
 after us, that we would truly feel your love at work in the lives of our homes and our

751
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,840
 families.

752
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
 Thank you, Lord.

753
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
 We love you, Father.

754
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
 In Jesus' name we pray.

755
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,340
 Amen.

756
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,420
 In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
