1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
 Everyone says, "Amen."

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,640
 Amen, amen.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,600
 Okay, can we take our worship team as always?

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,400
 (congregation applauding)

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,720
 Have a seat, have a seat.

6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,440
 As always, we're incredibly full here.

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,120
 So as you sit down and you realize

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,780
 that you might have a seat next to you,

9
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,680
 maybe just raise your hand.

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,960
 Our host will try and come and place people in seats.

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,540
 We have a couple of seats here.

12
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,960
 There's one here.

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,160
 There's one here, is that one?

14
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,560
 There's one here, you guys.

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,160
 (clicking)

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,580
 Anyone else need a seat?

17
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,920
 There's some seats around.

18
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,960
 If you're new to The Vine, welcome.

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,780
 We're so glad you're here.

20
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,620
 My name's Andrew.

21
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,400
 I'm one of the pastors here,

22
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,080
 and we're glad that you guys are a part

23
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,280
 of what we're doing here at The Vine.

24
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,480
 And if you're joining us online,

25
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,800
 welcome for wherever it is that you're tuning in online.

26
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,360
 We're in week three of a four-week series

27
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,440
 that we're starting at the beginning of this year,

28
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,400
 where we're looking at this idea

29
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,760
 that there are four mindset shifts

30
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,300
 that we need as people

31
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,360
 if we're gonna transition from the year of 2024,

32
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,540
 which here at The Vine was a year of intimacy with Jesus,

33
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,080
 to a year of what we're saying 2025 is about,

34
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,760
 a year of harvest, a year of birthing, a year of action.

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,160
 If we're gonna move from a place of intimacy

36
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,800
 to a place of action,

37
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,680
 there are four mindset shifts that are needed

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,360
 for us to move into all that God has for this year.

39
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,400
 And so this series,

40
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,600
 we're basing in the lives of Samuel and David,

41
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,280
 and we're looking at a very critical time

42
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,900
 of biblical history,

43
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,400
 the time where at the end of Samuel's life,

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,480
 he finishes his work as a judge

45
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,220
 and he anoints first Saul to be king,

46
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,200
 and then he anoints David to be king.

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,480
 And then David begins this moment in his life

48
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,880
 where he's preparing himself to become the king

49
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,200
 that the Jewish people in the Old Testament speak of

50
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
 as this Davidic dynasty.

51
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,200
 This time where the bloodline of David himself

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,680
 will go all the way to bringing in Jesus Christ.

53
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,040
 That moment of history

54
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,400
 is what we're looking at over this series.

55
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,100
 And it's such a critical moment

56
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,460
 because there is a transition that happens

57
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,520
 for both Samuel and David

58
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,040
 from a place of deep intimacy with the Lord

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,180
 to a place of being used by him

60
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,060
 to use their story for his glory.

61
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,500
 And as we dive into this,

62
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,140
 as I was just saying a moment ago,

63
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,920
 it's so easy for us to end up living someone else's story.

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,500
 It was tempting for Samuel and for David

65
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,180
 to remain in the story

66
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,100
 that someone else had written for them

67
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,740
 rather than release themselves

68
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,580
 with courage and boldness and bravery

69
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,180
 into the story God was asking them to live.

70
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,060
 And I honestly wanna just say one more time,

71
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,260
 as I look over you guys,

72
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,900
 I have such a burden in my heart.

73
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,700
 I'm so excited about the potential that is in this room,

74
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,420
 about the stories that God is already writing

75
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,580
 on your lives and in your hearts.

76
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,040
 And I believe that we can be released

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,300
 into that story even more

78
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,960
 as we open ourselves to what happens here.

79
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,440
 In the first week of this series,

80
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,920
 we talked about what it is to have a right start,

81
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,720
 how we can position ourselves to begin the journey well.

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,160
 Last week, Ellison took us through this incredible message

83
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
 where he spoke to us

84
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,040
 about the power of making the right choices,

85
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
 not only realizing that we need to start

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,240
 from the right place,

87
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,260
 but we need to make the right choices

88
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,600
 in the journey that we're in.

89
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,600
 Today, I wanna talk to you about wearing the right clothes.

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,840
 That's right, the right clothes.

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,380
 Now, what on earth is that all about?

92
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,180
 Well, to understand that,

93
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,120
 we need to pick up the story

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,680
 from where Ellison left off last week.

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,040
 We saw at the end of last week

96
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,100
 that Samuel pours out that oil,

97
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,680
 the horn that he had filled with oil,

98
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,640
 he pours it out over the top of David

99
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,760
 and he makes the right choice.

100
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
 He doesn't look by the surface of things,

101
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
 he looks in the heart and he chooses David.

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,340
 He pours and he anoints David to become king.

103
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,480
 Now, here's the fascinating thing.

104
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,880
 I want you to hear this.

105
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,000
 David doesn't actually become king for another 12 years.

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,720
 It's really fascinating that.

107
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,800
 There's actually a whole sermon here

108
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
 that I don't have time to preach right now,

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,160
 but I'm gonna preach you the minimum sermon, okay?

110
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,360
 I'll preach you like the one minute version of that sermon.

111
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,600
 Just because God has anointed you for a task

112
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
 doesn't necessarily mean that it's the right time

113
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,860
 to start that task.

114
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,360
 Because you see, David was anointed to be king,

115
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,600
 but it would be 12 years

116
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,160
 before he actually became king of Israel.

117
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,600
 And if David's anything like me,

118
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,760
 there's a lot of frustration in that break,

119
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,280
 between I'm anointed, God's called me,

120
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,360
 God's asked me to do something,

121
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,340
 but it's 12 long years before I can actually do it.

122
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,760
 But God understood that David needed some training.

123
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
 He understood that there needed to be a season

124
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,560
 of waiting in David's life.

125
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,040
 He knew that actually David needed a time

126
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,000
 to embrace the character by which he would need

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,960
 to hold him in the place of anointing.

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
 And although he was anointed 12 years,

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,800
 he would then have the character and the skill

130
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,480
 and the vision to be able to stand as king

131
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,840
 and be one of the greatest kings that Israel has ever had.

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,800
 Some of you right now, you've been anointed for a task,

133
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,080
 but it's not necessarily the right time

134
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,960
 for you to move into that task.

135
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,520
 There's a time of anointing,

136
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,960
 and then there's a time of waiting.

137
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,680
 And then there's sometimes a time of learning,

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,360
 and then some discipleship, and a time of equipping,

139
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,340
 and then a time of releasing.

140
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,320
 So David is anointed to be king, but there's this period.

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,200
 And what happens in that period is that Saul

142
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,120
 invites David into his household.

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,480
 This is really interesting because Saul sees in David

144
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,360
 that there is this incredible potential in him,

145
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,200
 and he invites him in.

146
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,320
 Now, the reason why he invites him in

147
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,520
 is because Saul at this time

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,000
 is having demonic manifestations.

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,320
 He's struggling with a demonic spirit,

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,280
 and only when David plays a harp

151
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,720
 does that demonic spirit quieten in his life.

152
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,080
 And so he brings David in,

153
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,840
 and anytime he feels this demonic spirit coming on him,

154
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,080
 he asks David to play the harp,

155
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,140
 and David plays the harp, and it chills him out.

156
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,120
 Now, Saul is so pleased with this.

157
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,960
 In fact, the Scriptures say that he so likes David

158
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,880
 that he makes David his personal armor bearer.

159
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
 Now, this has a lot to do with what I'm gonna say,

160
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
 so just listen to this for a moment.

161
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,360
 He makes David his personal armor bearer.

162
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,080
 What that means is that David was responsible

163
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,880
 for Saul's battle armor.

164
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,060
 So whether that was his tunic that he would wear under it,

165
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,800
 the armor itself, the weapons of battle

166
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,640
 that the king would have,

167
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,280
 it was David's responsibility to make sure

168
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,840
 that those things were always battle-ready,

169
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,240
 so to make sure that the sword was always sharp,

170
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,340
 to make sure that the tunic was always folded neatly,

171
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,400
 to make sure that the armor was prepared and oiled rightly

172
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,640
 so it would move with flexibility on the battlefield.

173
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,160
 It was David's responsibility to prepare the armor

174
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,640
 for whatever battle might come.

175
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,160
 Does that make sense to you?

176
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,200
 Now, interestingly, a battle comes.

177
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,080
 In fact, very soon after he's made armor bearer,

178
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,680
 just as these sort of stories go,

179
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,120
 suddenly a nation rises up to attack Israel.

180
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,000
 It's the nation of Philistia.

181
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,520
 And Philistia rises up and goes to the borders

182
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,600
 of Israel's land and threatens to attack Israel.

183
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,920
 So Israel's army move up towards the borders,

184
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,960
 and there's this standoff on the border.

185
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
 Now, here's the interesting thing.

186
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,960
 In those days, battles could actually be fought

187
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,760
 by a peculiar kind of custom.

188
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,680
 What it was is that one kind of warrior from one side

189
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,400
 and one warrior from the other side could fight,

190
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,900
 and whoever won that battle, the whole nation wins.

191
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,440
 So it was a way of kind of making sure

192
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,400
 there wasn't like bloodshed for everybody

193
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,040
 in this long protracted war.

194
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,120
 Just one warrior versus one warrior, fight it out,

195
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,040
 and then the nation, whoever warrior stands

196
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,520
 at the end of it, the nation wins.

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,040
 This is what happens.

198
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,560
 So Philistia sends forward their best warrior.

199
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,520
 You probably know this story.

200
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,040
 His name's Goliath.

201
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,840
 Goliath is described in the Bible as being nine feet tall.

202
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,240
 Don't ask me to explain that.

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,480
 He is nine feet tall, and he is terrifying.

204
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,400
 And the Bible says that he's been a champion

205
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
 since his youth.

206
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,700
 Now, this is interesting because Israel's response,

207
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,660
 the Scriptures write this,

208
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,440
 Israel's response is one of fear and dismay.

209
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,200
 They look at the nine foot giant

210
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,000
 who's been a warrior since youth,

211
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,320
 and they're thinking maybe it's better

212
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,760
 of the whole army's battle right now,

213
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,480
 'cause if one of us has to go against that one,

214
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,960
 there's no way this is gonna work out for us.

215
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,560
 And they're so filled with fear that nobody in Israel

216
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,120
 is willing to put their hand up to fight Goliath.

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,720
 And so the Bible says for 40 days,

218
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,720
 Goliath would come to the edge of the battlefield,

219
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,040
 dressed in all of his armor,

220
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,880
 and he would shout at the Israelites

221
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,280
 who were about 100 whatever yards away,

222
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,480
 and he would shout and say,

223
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,560
 isn't anybody willing to come and fight me?

224
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,020
 Are you all chickens?

225
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,240
 Are you all feeble?

226
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,400
 And then he would shout down Israel's God.

227
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,320
 Your God is nothing, blah, blah, blah.

228
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,880
 He would come and say all this verbal insults

229
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,840
 to the people, and for 40 days, Israel just sat in terror.

230
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,320
 Until one day, when David is so frustrated

231
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,800
 that no one is doing anything, that he decides to act.

232
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,560
 He's like, well, if none of you are gonna do it,

233
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
 well then, then I'll do it.

234
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,600
 And he starts to think,

235
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,040
 well, maybe I can go before this Philistine.

236
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,240
 He's just an uncircumcised Philistine.

237
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,520
 He doesn't have the power of God behind him.

238
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
 He represents something that is uncircumcised,

239
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,640
 something that is defiled,

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
 and he's standing before us and defiling the name of our God.

241
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,520
 This cannot happen.

242
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,920
 And so he goes to Saul and he says, I'll fight him.

243
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,280
 And Saul looks at him and says, no, you won't.

244
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,520
 Like, 'cause if you go, this whole thing's over.

245
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,280
 Like, if you go, we'll lose everything.

246
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,080
 He literally says, you're just a boy.

247
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
 Like, you're my armor bearer.

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,200
 That's basically like, it's like, you're not even,

249
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,080
 like, you've never been trained for war.

250
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,560
 You're not a warrior.

251
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,880
 You're not even a trainer.

252
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,160
 It's like, you know, in boxing,

253
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,400
 there's like the one guy that like tapes the gloves

254
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,040
 around the boxer's arms, right?

255
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,880
 That's basically David, right?

256
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,760
 And so Saul's like, sensibly, no, no, no, no,

257
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,800
 you're not gonna do this.

258
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,680
 And then David, I love the courage of David.

259
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,560
 He goes through his resume.

260
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,600
 Ever done this with someone?

261
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,920
 Oh, but you don't know who I really am.

262
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,800
 You don't understand that I'm a shepherd.

263
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,680
 You can imagine Saul going, great,

264
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,280
 that's gonna work really well.

265
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,960
 He's like, I'm a shepherd, right?

266
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,520
 Like, and he said, you gotta understand,

267
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,720
 I tend the flocks of my father,

268
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,920
 and when the bears come, and when the lions come,

269
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,920
 I run after them, and I defeat them.

270
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,960
 I kill them.

271
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,680
 And this Philistine, this Goliath,

272
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,960
 he's just like an oversized bear.

273
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,520
 He's like an oversized lion.

274
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,760
 If you let me, I will go and fight him.

275
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,120
 And for some reason, the Bible doesn't tell us why,

276
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,240
 Saul changes his mind, and he says, okay, then, go.

277
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,760
 And you're like, hang on, at this point in the story,

278
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,920
 you're like, what is going on here?

279
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,520
 Here's what I think is going on.

280
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,560
 Saul realizes that because none of his army

281
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,440
 is going to fight, everybody's looking at him to fight.

282
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,400
 And he's so afraid himself to fight

283
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,520
 that he's willing to let a shepherd boy go fight.

284
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
 Great leadership.

285
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,880
 [audience laughing]

286
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,880
 So, so we know the rest of the story, don't we?

287
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,840
 He lets David go.

288
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,800
 David puts five little pebbles in his pouch,

289
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,920
 and he takes his staff, and he takes his shepherd's bag,

290
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,760
 and he runs after Goliath, and he says,

291
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,360
 you're just a stinky, little, uncircumcised Gentile.

292
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,920
 [imitates gun firing]

293
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,720
 Hits him first try, stone in the forehead.

294
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,040
 Doesn't kill him with that shot.

295
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,880
 He falls on the ground and literally is passed out.

296
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,320
 And then he takes a sword, and he cuts off Goliath's head.

297
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,360
 That's what kills him, cuts off his head.

298
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,960
 And he holds his head up in front of everybody,

299
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,400
 and he says, look what my God has done.

300
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,760
 And we have, for all history,

301
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,600
 one of the greatest stories of an underdog

302
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,960
 winning for everyone, amen?

303
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,880
 There's a moment in the story, though.

304
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,400
 There's this moment in the story

305
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,920
 that is the real reason why I think

306
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,160
 David actually wins the battle.

307
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,760
 And it's not because he has these five stones in a sling,

308
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,040
 and he has his shepherd's staff,

309
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
 and he has a sword that he cuts his head off.

310
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,040
 Actually, I think he wins the battle much earlier than that.

311
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,640
 And there's this little part in the story

312
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,560
 that is very often overlooked.

313
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,120
 In fact, most of the times the story's told,

314
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,240
 this part isn't even told with it.

315
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,880
 But I think it's this moment in the story

316
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,320
 where actually the victory takes place.

317
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,400
 And I think if we can understand the principle

318
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,560
 of what David does in this part of the story,

319
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,640
 it might actually set you up for the battle

320
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,720
 that God has put before you.

321
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,800
 So I wonder whether we could look at this

322
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,160
 little moment in the story.

323
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,200
 We're gonna jump back to the moment

324
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,760
 where David is giving his resume to Saul

325
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,240
 about being a shepherd.

326
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,200
 So this is picking up in 1 Samuel 17,

327
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,360
 starting in verse 34.

328
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,080
 But David said to Saul,

329
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,200
 "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep.

330
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,520
 "When a lion or a bear came and carried the sheep

331
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,640
 "from the flock, I went after it,

332
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,800
 "struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth.

333
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,320
 "When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair,

334
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,960
 "struck it and killed it.

335
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,080
 "Your servant has killed both lion and bear.

336
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,240
 "The uncircumcised Philistine, ha, ha, ha, ha,

337
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,920
 "will be like one of them,

338
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,920
 "because he has defiled the armies of the living God.

339
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,600
 "The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion

340
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,760
 "and the paw of the bear will deliver me

341
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,200
 "from the hand of this Philistine."

342
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,120
 So Saul said to David, "Go."

343
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,840
 And the Lord be with you.

344
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,080
 Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic.

345
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,680
 He put a coat of armor on him

346
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
 and a bronze helmet on his head.

347
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,560
 David fastened on his sword over the tunic

348
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,800
 and tried to walk around because he was not used to them.

349
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,120
 "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul,

350
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,720
 "because I'm not used to them."

351
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,240
 So he took them off.

352
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,760
 Then he took up his staff in his hand

353
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,520
 and he chose five smooth stones from the stream

354
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,160
 and he put them in his pouch of his shepherd's bag.

355
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,720
 And then with his sling in his hand,

356
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,160
 he approached the Philistine.

357
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
 There's this beautiful moment that happens here

358
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,400
 where Saul finally says, "Okay, you're gonna go

359
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,840
 "because I don't wanna fight, so you're gonna go."

360
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,040
 And he says these really quite important words.

361
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,880
 He says, "Go in the Lord."

362
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,520
 Doesn't that sound great?

363
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,260
 Doesn't that sound faithful?

364
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,920
 But he does this really interesting thing.

365
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,920
 He says to David, "Go in the Lord,"

366
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,440
 but then he does immediately something

367
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,760
 that seems to contradict that very thing.

368
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,600
 Notice this.

369
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,280
 He says, "Go in the Lord,"

370
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,400
 and then he dresses him like himself.

371
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,120
 He says, "Go in the Lord, but I want you to look like me."

372
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,400
 Go in the Lord, but you're gonna wear my clothes.

373
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,560
 Are you following?

374
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,760
 Which seems kind of contradictory

375
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,840
 'cause you just told me to go in the Lord,

376
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,300
 but now you're telling me how you want me to go.

377
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,320
 I thought this was the Lord,

378
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,400
 but now you're making this again about yourself.

379
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,920
 But I want you to see what happens here.

380
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
 He says, literally, it says,

381
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,880
 "Saul, then dress David in his tunic."

382
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,200
 It's like Saul, his thinking is this.

383
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,520
 Now notice this, don't be upset at Saul

384
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,980
 because Saul loves David, remember?

385
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,740
 And Saul's sending David into a battle

386
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,920
 that he thinks David is not gonna win.

387
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,060
 So he wants to set David up for success.

388
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,220
 His intentions are really good.

389
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,220
 Are you following this?

390
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,660
 His intentions are pure.

391
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,100
 He says, "Look, you're gonna go into battle,

392
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,700
 "and I know that's gonna be hard

393
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,080
 "because there's a nine-foot guy

394
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,360
 "and you're just a shepherd's boy,

395
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,620
 "so you're probably gonna lose,

396
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,040
 "but I wanna give you the best thing I can give you.

397
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,580
 "I wanna help you to be best prepared

398
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,780
 "for the battle that's ahead.

399
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,100
 "I wanna do all that I can."

400
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,940
 So you know what?

401
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,620
 I'm gonna give you my armor.

402
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,580
 This is the best armor in Israel.

403
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,180
 Nobody else's armor like this.

404
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,260
 In fact, no one in the history of Israel

405
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,500
 has ever worn the king's armor.

406
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,700
 It's reserved specifically for the king.

407
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,940
 It's the nicest, most expensive, best prepared.

408
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,540
 It is the best armor that they could possibly be made.

409
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,120
 And my heart for you, David, is that you would succeed.

410
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,060
 So I'm gonna give you the best of myself,

411
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,140
 the best of me to you,

412
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,620
 so that you can do your best on the battlefield.

413
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,140
 His heart and his intentions are good.

414
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,300
 Do you follow that?

415
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,660
 But notice what the Bible tells us

416
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,420
 about the physical stature between Saul and David.

417
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,140
 Saul, we're described a couple of chapters earlier

418
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,180
 as head and shoulders above everybody else in Israel.

419
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,340
 He was tall, he was broad, he was big, he was muscular.

420
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,540
 And then we learned that David himself

421
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,460
 was small of stature, was a little boy,

422
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,140
 didn't have much muscle.

423
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,860
 You could think the two of them are like peas apart.

424
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,680
 Does that make sense?

425
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,520
 Like way apart.

426
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,500
 So when Saul goes,

427
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,220
 "Here's the best thing I wanna do for you.

428
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,080
 "I want you to take the best of me.

429
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,260
 "I'm gonna put it on you,

430
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,720
 "so that you can kind of wear it in the battlefield."

431
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,680
 It was literally like if somebody came to me and said,

432
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,480
 "Andrew, I've got this beautiful jacket

433
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,020
 "that's really expensive, and I want you to put it on

434
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,880
 "'cause you're gonna look awesome

435
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,420
 "when you preach on a Sunday."

436
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,580
 (audience laughing)

437
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,980
 And you put it on, and you're suddenly MC Hammer.

438
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,820
 (audience laughing)

439
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,780
 That's a reference from my era, by the way.

440
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,580
 But you suddenly put it on, and you can imagine David,

441
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,620
 he's honored.

442
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,900
 Follow this, church.

443
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,160
 He's honored because Saul has looked at him and said,

444
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,140
 "I want the best for you."

445
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,320
 And David loves Saul too.

446
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,860
 And so he takes on what it is that Saul wants to give him,

447
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,900
 and he puts it on.

448
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,420
 But you can almost see him putting it on,

449
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,520
 and Saul going,

450
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,060
 and David going like this, you know?

451
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,820
 Because he realizes that the tunic wasn't made for him.

452
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,700
 It wasn't designed for him.

453
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,900
 It didn't fit him, are you with me?

454
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,980
 It was comfortable for Saul.

455
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,980
 It was the best armor possible, but it fitted Saul.

456
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,900
 It didn't fit David.

457
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,220
 And yet now David's wearing it, and David's thinking,

458
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,080
 "Well, he's got the right heart for me.

459
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,140
 "He's got the right intentions for me.

460
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,680
 "I don't wanna upset him.

461
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,940
 "I don't wanna put him off, so I'll take it, I'll wear it."

462
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,860
 But suddenly he's like, "Hang on a sec.

463
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,940
 "This does not feel right for me."

464
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,300
 I want you to see this.

465
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,300
 See, David is dressed for the right battle.

466
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,140
 He's just wearing the wrong clothes.

467
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,820
 Like he knew the battle was the one

468
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,580
 that God was calling him into.

469
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,420
 He knew that he was being released to fight this.

470
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,860
 He had the courage to believe that if God was with him,

471
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,980
 the battle would be won,

472
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,340
 but he's suddenly dressed in the wrong clothes.

473
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,660
 See, this is 2025, and if you live here in Hong Kong,

474
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,540
 if this is your home city,

475
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,700
 if this is where you work and where you live

476
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,020
 and God has planted you here,

477
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,980
 I want you to hear this.

478
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,420
 No matter how you feel about Hong Kong,

479
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,860
 no matter whether you like it or you don't,

480
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,180
 whether you wanna be here forever or you don't,

481
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,060
 whether you're excited about its future or not,

482
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,880
 you need to understand

483
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,760
 that if this is where you are currently living,

484
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,220
 you are in the right battle.

485
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,540
 Like this land, this place,

486
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,180
 is the place where he wants to use your God-given gifts,

487
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,420
 your talents, your heart,

488
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,940
 to sow the gospel into this land.

489
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,260
 He wants you to fight with love and justice

490
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,980
 and heart and forgiveness.

491
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,500
 He wants you to bring the gospel

492
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,060
 into your sphere of influence.

493
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,140
 You are in the right battle.

494
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,540
 My question to you is,

495
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,340
 are you wearing the right clothes?

496
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,580
 Because you can be in the right battle,

497
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,900
 but wearing the wrong clothes.

498
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,460
 And David sort of realized that he was in a situation

499
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,880
 where things didn't quite seem to be right for him.

500
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,320
 And it's really important that we come to recognize

501
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,040
 that this doesn't just happen for David.

502
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,400
 This happens for all of us.

503
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,880
 That oftentimes, people in our lives

504
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
 who are really well-intentioned,

505
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,400
 who actually love us,

506
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
 who want the best for us,

507
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,860
 they want us to win our battle,

508
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,160
 they put their clothes on us.

509
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,760
 Because they love you and they want you to succeed.

510
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,880
 They want you to win the battle.

511
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,240
 And from their perspective,

512
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,200
 if only you could be a bit more like this,

513
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,080
 if only you could look a little bit more like this,

514
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,680
 if only you could act a bit more like this,

515
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,880
 then you will actually survive and thrive in this world.

516
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,300
 So there are people with good intentions

517
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,200
 that will try to put their clothes on us that don't fit.

518
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,300
 Are you with me?

519
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,800
 But there are also people with bad intentions,

520
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,240
 people that don't have our best in mind,

521
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,040
 people that actually want us to fail,

522
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,680
 that don't want us to succeed.

523
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,580
 David had someone who wanted his best.

524
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,120
 We can often have people that don't want our best,

525
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,360
 and they're still putting their clothes on us.

526
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,040
 What sort of clothes do people place on us?

527
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,520
 Well, let me go to my clothes rack

528
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,680
 and show you some of the clothes

529
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,540
 that I think people place on us.

530
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,640
 I think, first of all,

531
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,200
 they place their own expectations on us.

532
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,400
 They place their expectations,

533
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,560
 the thoughts that they have

534
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,200
 about what they're expecting you to do,

535
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,920
 how they expect you to act in certain situations,

536
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,280
 and how they expect you to be.

537
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,060
 And they have their own expectations

538
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,200
 for what they think is best.

539
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,060
 And again, it can come from a good place,

540
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,260
 but it can also come from a bad place.

541
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,820
 Either way, there are many of us in this room

542
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,540
 who are wearing somebody else's expectations,

543
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,460
 and it's weighing us down.

544
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,300
 Guess what?

545
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,500
 It doesn't fit,

546
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,740
 'cause it's not the expectation

547
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,660
 that God has asked you to wear.

548
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,700
 But you've put on somebody else's expectations.

549
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,740
 They've put those things on you,

550
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,220
 and you're now wearing them,

551
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,320
 and you're wondering why you're exhausted.

552
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,700
 What other clothes do we wear?

553
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,220
 I think sometimes we do this.

554
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,680
 We wear the values of others.

555
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,100
 Other people put their values upon us.

556
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,800
 Hey, this is how you should be.

557
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,460
 This is what you should stand for in this world.

558
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,940
 Hey, you should just sleep around.

559
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,420
 Everybody else is doing it.

560
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,260
 Hey, it's fine.

561
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,080
 I know you're a Christian,

562
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,920
 but hey, guess what?

563
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,020
 There's this really hot girl in the office in Singapore.

564
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,300
 I can hook you up when you're next there

565
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,260
 on a business trip.

566
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,080
 My values are the best values for you.

567
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,740
 And if only you could live a little bit more

568
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,160
 with my values in mind,

569
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,340
 I think your life would go a little bit better.

570
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,500
 And so whether we're good intentions or bad intentions,

571
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,460
 some of us in this room,

572
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,020
 we're wearing the values

573
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,740
 that we're not supposed to be wearing,

574
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,700
 the values that somebody else has placed upon our shoulders.

575
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,220
 Are you with me?

576
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,580
 Or if I can get a little bit more personal

577
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,180
 with us in our culture here in Hong Kong,

578
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,780
 look at all of these ones right here.

579
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,580
 Maybe some well-intentioned people in our lives

580
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,380
 have said, "Here's the university you should go to."

581
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,680
 Hey, if you just do the good grades,

582
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,460
 you'll get this university.

583
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,420
 Or maybe they're like, "Hey, here's the career.

584
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,200
 "You know, I know you are a dancer and you love to dance,

585
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,040
 "but guess what?

586
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,860
 "You're a lawyer.

587
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,820
 "You're a banker.

588
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,740
 "I know this 'cause I've seen your future.

589
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,940
 "And I know what's best for you.

590
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,080
 "You know, if you tried to dance,

591
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,800
 "you're gonna be unemployed working in Starbucks.

592
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,080
 "You don't wanna work in Starbucks.

593
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,240
 "Forget the creative arts.

594
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,600
 "Look, you can do that as a hobby,

595
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,800
 "but you're a lawyer."

596
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,040
 Or maybe someone said like,

597
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
 "Hey, here's the person you should marry."

598
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,120
 Oh yeah, I've got the person for you.

599
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,200
 You should marry this person because of what they can do.

600
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,040
 Or here's the company that you should work for.

601
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,900
 You're getting the point, right?

602
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,220
 So we have all these things, all these clothes

603
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,240
 that other people have placed upon us

604
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,200
 that we've either accepted and they've either done it

605
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,520
 because they love us or they've done it

606
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,720
 because they don't love us and they want us to fail.

607
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,520
 Either way, we're wearing stuff that doesn't fit

608
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,460
 and we're dressed for the right battle

609
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,840
 and we're wearing the wrong clothes.

610
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,440
 And if 2025 is gonna be a year of harvest

611
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,600
 and growth for us, if we're gonna be living our faith

612
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,280
 more publicly in the world around us,

613
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,760
 then we need to realize that we're sometimes not dressed

614
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,720
 in the right way for the battle that we've been placed in.

615
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,120
 Now, I want you to also hear this.

616
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,080
 This doesn't just happen

617
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,840
 because other people place their expectations,

618
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,920
 their choices or their values on us.

619
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,720
 This also happens because we take other people's

620
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,280
 expectations.

621
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,720
 We take other people's values

622
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,160
 and we place them on our own shoulders.

623
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,720
 So sometimes it happens because somebody does it to you.

624
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,080
 And some of you in this room,

625
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,880
 maybe you're well-meaning and well-loved parents

626
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,680
 or maybe it was a boss or maybe it was someone in your life,

627
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,000
 maybe it was a past relationship.

628
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,600
 They've placed some expectations and choices on you

629
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,760
 and it's weighing you down.

630
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,080
 But the reality is for a lot of us,

631
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,880
 we place those things on ourselves.

632
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
 Let me tell you this.

633
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,680
 I became senior pastor here at the Vine in 2013.

634
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,400
 And in 2013, I was 37 years old, don't do the math,

635
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,720
 but I was 37 years old at the time.

636
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,840
 And John and Tony, who are our previous senior pastors here,

637
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,040
 they did a fantastic job of taking a church of 40 people

638
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,440
 and growing it into this big

639
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,020
 and successful church in Hong Kong.

640
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,960
 And I was 37 years old

641
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,060
 and I had no idea how to be a senior pastor.

642
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,060
 I mean, I'd been to Bible school, I'd been prepared,

643
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,000
 they had done a great job preparing me.

644
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,520
 But as I stepped into the role,

645
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,440
 I felt overwhelmed with what it was.

646
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,560
 And I thought, I'm gonna be the senior pastor,

647
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,880
 the first in the Vine's history

648
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,240
 who's gonna take the church off the cliff.

649
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,940
 And the church has had this kind of trajectory growth

650
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,240
 since day one and then Andrew takes over.

651
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,400
 Are you with me?

652
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
 And now, hear this,

653
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,840
 John and Tony didn't put any expectations on my shoulders.

654
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,600
 I mean, I'm sure they had dreams for me

655
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,080
 and they had dreams for the church,

656
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,020
 but one of the things that they did

657
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,480
 most powerfully and beautifully

658
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,860
 is when I became senior pastor,

659
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,280
 they were like, be your man.

660
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,160
 Follow your dreams, listen to the Holy Spirit.

661
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,240
 They did all the right things.

662
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,880
 I did the wrong things.

663
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,880
 I was the one like, well, the Vine has always been this way.

664
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,560
 John and Tony have always done it this way.

665
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,040
 And if we're gonna continue to be successful,

666
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,920
 I guess we're gonna have to do it that way.

667
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,640
 And although maybe I've got some new ideas,

668
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,640
 I think actually I've got more fear in me than faith in me.

669
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,280
 And that fear is causing me to take on board what they did

670
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,480
 and try to be the same senior pastor that they were.

671
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,000
 And after a year of this,

672
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,320
 I was so emotionally and spiritually exhausted.

673
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,960
 I took my wife out for dinner.

674
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,840
 We sat down at this very public restaurant

675
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,760
 and I just started weeping like a baby in the restaurant.

676
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,200
 Everybody was looking at me like,

677
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
 what is going on with that guy?

678
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,160
 And I just started crying and crying.

679
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,400
 And I said to my wife, I said,

680
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,340
 what if I'm the first person in the history of this church,

681
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,840
 the first leader that actually ruins this church?

682
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,040
 What if people stop coming?

683
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,920
 What if people leave?

684
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,360
 What if we don't get our debts sorted out?

685
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,520
 What if all of this stuff happens?

686
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,240
 And I had all these fears in me

687
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,380
 'cause I had taken on someone else's expectations

688
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,260
 that I had chosen to wear myself,

689
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,280
 even when they weren't asking me to wear it.

690
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,160
 And my wife said something very important.

691
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,600
 She said, how long are you gonna go

692
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,700
 trying to pretend to be someone you're not?

693
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,280
 I wanna say that over some of you here this morning.

694
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,080
 How long are you gonna go

695
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,360
 trying to be actually someone you're not

696
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,700
 and instead try to be someone

697
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,400
 that someone else wants you to be?

698
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,920
 And David had to realize, hang on a sec,

699
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,640
 something's not quite right here.

700
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,920
 I want you to hear it this way.

701
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,120
 You cannot go into your battle

702
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,060
 wearing someone else's armor.

703
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,700
 I'm gonna say that one more time.

704
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,260
 You cannot go into your battle

705
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,380
 wearing someone else's armor.

706
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,180
 That never works.

707
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,240
 So what do we do?

708
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,140
 Notice what David does in verse 39.

709
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,980
 It says this.

710
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,180
 David fastened on a sword over his tunic

711
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,620
 and tried to walk around because he was not used to them.

712
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,460
 And then he says this.

713
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,340
 I cannot go in these, he said to Saul,

714
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,860
 because I'm not used to them.

715
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,440
 Can you see the courage that sits in David?

716
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,860
 Remember, David respected and loved Saul.

717
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,640
 And he so honored and respected him

718
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,320
 that he was very conscious of that.

719
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,780
 But notice what David does here.

720
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,080
 He doesn't honor and respect Saul greater

721
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,920
 than his conviction that God is calling him

722
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,720
 to live a life how he should be living it.

723
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,180
 He honors and respects Saul,

724
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,480
 but that honor and respect is not greater

725
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,680
 than his faithfulness to be committed and convicted

726
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,460
 to live how God's called him to live.

727
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,760
 So he takes the oversized jacket,

728
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,960
 he puts it on, he walks around,

729
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,520
 and then he has the courage in him

730
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,240
 to humbly, beautifully, kindly go up to Saul

731
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,440
 and say, Saul, I cannot go in these.

732
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,080
 I love you.

733
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,920
 I love you.

734
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,620
 And I know you have my best intentions in mind,

735
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,540
 but I cannot go in these.

736
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,600
 And I want you to hear this.

737
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,400
 Some of you here at the beginning of 2025,

738
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,280
 you've been wearing other people's expectations

739
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,320
 far too long.

740
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,480
 You've been wearing the heavy garments,

741
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,040
 the heavy clothes of other people's choices,

742
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,080
 of how other people want you to be,

743
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,040
 of how the dreams that they've had in their heart for you,

744
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,920
 and you've been sat under the weight

745
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,680
 of somebody else's dreams.

746
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,240
 And perhaps at the beginning of this year,

747
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,880
 you need to find the courage to say,

748
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,280
 I cannot any longer go in these.

749
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,480
 I cannot any longer go forward wearing

750
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,840
 what other people have asked me to wear.

751
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,160
 And I know they did it out of good intentions.

752
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,680
 I know they love me deeply.

753
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,080
 I know they want my best,

754
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,000
 but just like David does to Saul,

755
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,680
 I can't, I can't go in these.

756
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,720
 I'm just not used to them.

757
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,960
 They're not me, they're you.

758
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,480
 And they served you well.

759
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,520
 This battle armor was custom made for you.

760
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,120
 It served you well, but it will not serve me.

761
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,940
 David understood.

762
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,600
 He was more in danger in the battlefield

763
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,820
 wearing Saul's armor than in the courage to actually say,

764
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,360
 this is not gonna work for me.

765
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,560
 Oh, that we would get a spirit inside of us

766
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,520
 here at the Vine, where because we wanna go forward,

767
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,680
 because we wanna move,

768
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,560
 because we want the gospel to change our city,

769
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,720
 because we're so excited about how God's at work

770
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,040
 in the people around us,

771
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,200
 that we would realize that we need to take ownership

772
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,160
 of the clothes that we're wearing and decide,

773
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,200
 I am not gonna take another step forward.

774
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,400
 I'm not gonna move another inch forward.

775
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,620
 I'm not gonna go forward this year

776
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,580
 in the clothes that other people want me to wear.

777
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,980
 I cannot go in these.

778
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,020
 That prophetic prayer,

779
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,380
 that prophetic utterance in our hearts changes everything.

780
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,700
 And it changes everything for David.

781
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,740
 Do you know what he does next?

782
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,560
 Follow this.

783
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,880
 Is this helpful so far?

784
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,720
 Follow this.

785
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,540
 Look what he says here.

786
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,100
 I love this.

787
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,180
 In verse 39, he says,

788
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,620
 I cannot go in these, said Saul,

789
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,700
 because I'm not used to them.

790
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,180
 So he took them off.

791
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,580
 Everybody say amen.

792
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,620
 He took them off.

793
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,800
 Simple.

794
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,860
 So simple.

795
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,220
 I wish I could give you a more complicated process,

796
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,540
 but here's the reality.

797
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,540
 If you're wearing somebody else's clothes, take them off.

798
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,140
 First of all, you have to go, I cannot go in these.

799
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,420
 That's the first step,

800
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,160
 to realize this is not what I was designed to carry,

801
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,000
 to wear.

802
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,300
 I look kind of ridiculous in these.

803
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,420
 Then the second thing is, take them off.

804
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,820
 Now, this is really interesting,

805
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,460
 'cause it sounds so simple, doesn't it?

806
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,060
 Just take them off.

807
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,400
 But if it's so simple, why do most of us fail to do it?

808
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,080
 Because if you're anything like me,

809
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,940
 so often we actually fail to remove the clothes

810
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,120
 that we know we shouldn't be wearing.

811
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,860
 Those false expectations that have been placed on us.

812
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,260
 Those values that other people want us to live.

813
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,620
 Why is it that it's simple to take them off,

814
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,500
 but we very rarely do take them off?

815
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,180
 And instead, we live in the opposite of this.

816
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,140
 Instead, rather than take off the old,

817
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,980
 here's what we do.

818
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,820
 I'm just gonna put on the new.

819
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,780
 Like, I know I'm wearing stuff

820
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,940
 that I shouldn't be able to wear,

821
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,780
 but maybe I could just put on the new thing,

822
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,160
 and in putting on the new thing,

823
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,360
 no one will know that I'm still wearing the old.

824
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,300
 See, I think us Christians, we're good at this,

825
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,220
 'cause we're like, look, I know that there is

826
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,100
 this beautiful custom-made gown or jacket

827
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,940
 that God's made for me.

828
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,360
 This jacket, guys, was tailor-made for me.

829
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,340
 My wife tailor-made this jacket for me.

830
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,300
 Oh, this was expensive.

831
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,340
 This thing fits me like a glove.

832
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,740
 This thing's perfect for me.

833
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,460
 And as Christians, as we come into faith,

834
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,580
 we're like, Christ has his righteousness for us.

835
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,860
 Christ has his grace for us, his forgiveness for us.

836
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,100
 Christ has all these things that he wants us to be.

837
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,840
 He's got values and expectations

838
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,420
 that are given to flourish us,

839
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,300
 and we know as Christians that Christ has done this,

840
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,380
 and so here's what it is.

841
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,500
 We're wearing our old self, but we're like,

842
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,740
 I'm just gonna put on the new self,

843
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,860
 and if I put on the new self well enough,

844
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,720
 no one will know that I'm wearing the old.

845
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:19,340
 So we show up in church on Sunday wearing our new coat,

846
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,520
 custom-made for us 'cause of the blood of Jesus

847
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,040
 poured out into our lives.

848
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,820
 The cross paid the price so that I could be free

849
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,500
 in the expectations of Christ,

850
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,620
 and no one notices that I'm still wearing the old coat.

851
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,900
 I hope no one sees it.

852
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,740
 Maybe they see it.

853
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,140
 Maybe I'll just raise my hands a little bit more,

854
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,580
 and then no one will see it at all.

855
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
 And the thing is, we think that actually

856
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,560
 we can get away with two coats on.

857
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,240
 Here's the thing.

858
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,180
 Then we go into our offices,

859
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,100
 or we go into our social circles

860
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,660
 outside of our community of faith,

861
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,840
 and we're like this.

862
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,220
 And we play down the Christian bit, you know?

863
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,580
 And we just embrace the other jacket that we've always had,

864
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,740
 and it's like, hey, I'm just like you.

865
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,380
 I look good just like you.

866
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,620
 Are you with me?

867
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,140
 And we begin to sort of show that,

868
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,740
 or think that we're showing that we're a certain way

869
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,180
 and that this is the way we should be.

870
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,620
 You can't really see my Christian thing.

871
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,940
 Oh, and then somebody comes around the corner

872
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,760
 and goes to the vine.

873
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,980
 Oh, hi, how are you?

874
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,900
 Yeah, it's great to,

875
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,860
 [audience laughing]

876
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,820
 great to see you again.

877
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,980
 Nice to have you here.

878
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,460
 Yeah, good.

879
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,300
 Praise Jesus.

880
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,120
 Have a good day.

881
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,980
 [audience laughing]

882
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,980
 I joke, but I do this, and I'm a pastor.

883
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,340
 I found myself doing this at times.

884
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,740
 Perhaps you found yourself doing this at times.

885
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,100
 Why is it that we know we should take off the old clothes,

886
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,180
 but we actually just try to hide the old clothes?

887
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,260
 That we think Jesus will just cover everything up for us,

888
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
 and it'll be okay,

889
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,340
 even though we're still committed to two sets of values,

890
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,460
 two sets of choices, two sets of decisions.

891
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,620
 We've begun to define ourselves in that way.

892
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,260
 And we need to break out of this.

893
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,740
 David says, no, no, I'm gonna actually,

894
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,140
 as much as I love you, Saul,

895
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,300
 I respect you, I honor you,

896
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,540
 but you know what, I cannot go in these.

897
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,260
 I cannot go kind of holding two things of value

898
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,100
 at the same time.

899
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,900
 I need to kind of take these things off,

900
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,780
 and I need to change how I am,

901
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,260
 because you know what, it's just not me,

902
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,340
 and I know it's you,

903
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,700
 and I know you've got my best intentions.

904
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,260
 I know you love me, but you've gotta let me be me.

905
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,060
 Gotta let me be the way that Christ has called me to be.

906
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,260
 And I accept you, I love you, I honor you,

907
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,860
 but I cannot go in these.

908
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,540
 I take them off before I put anything else on.

909
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,460
 Some of you just need to realize

910
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,820
 that you've been trying to wear two jackets for too long,

911
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,940
 and that is not gonna help you

912
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,900
 to move forward in Christ in 2025.

913
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,860
 You cannot be a witness for Christ in public

914
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,180
 with your faith wearing two jackets.

915
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,380
 You know what people call that?

916
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,980
 Hypocrisy.

917
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,500
 And hypocrisy has killed the church

918
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,180
 so many times over 2,000 years.

919
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,220
 I do not want us at the Vine to be hypocrites.

920
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,420
 So let me challenge you strongly.

921
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,940
 Take off the old clothes.

922
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,060
 Have the courage and the bravery to remove them.

923
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,780
 Now, also follow this.

924
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,180
 Notice what happens next here from David.

925
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,540
 He takes off his clothes, and he says in verse 40,

926
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,780
 "Then he took his staff in his hand,

927
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,780
 "and he chose five smooth stones from the stream,

928
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,180
 "and he put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag."

929
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,180
 Notice this, he takes off the old clothes,

930
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,980
 but he doesn't stand around naked.

931
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,580
 The call is not to nakedness.

932
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,540
 He picks up his staff, he picks up his shepherd's pouch.

933
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,060
 Now, he did not wear those when he was an armor bearer.

934
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,620
 So this is David not taking off the tunic

935
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,820
 and picking up some other armor.

936
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,820
 It's not him trying to still be like a battle-worn warrior.

937
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,660
 This is him saying,

938
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,260
 "I need to be who God has called me to be.

939
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,620
 "I need to embrace the very thing

940
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,060
 "that God has put into my life.

941
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,140
 "I need to go back to receiving the identity

942
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,540
 "that Christ has given me.

943
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,180
 "If I can't live out of my true identity,

944
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,700
 "then I cannot fight this battle.

945
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,900
 "So I'm gonna remove the identities and the pressures

946
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,140
 "and the expectations and the choices

947
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,740
 "that everybody else has placed on me,

948
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,860
 "and I'm gonna lay them down,

949
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,380
 "and I'm gonna pick up the only thing that I can wear,

950
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,300
 "and that is the righteousness of Christ,

951
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,980
 "how Christ has called me to be."

952
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,660
 And he picks up the shepherd's clothes again,

953
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,980
 and he goes into battle.

954
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,340
 And there's this beautiful thought here

955
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,500
 that our call is not to nakedness.

956
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
 Now, here's the thing.

957
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,620
 The world does that for us.

958
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,620
 This is fascinating to me.

959
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,420
 The world has a movement right now

960
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,340
 that comes to define what true freedom is.

961
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,460
 It says true freedom is basically getting rid

962
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,740
 of all expectations in your life.

963
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,180
 True freedom is getting rid of all responsibilities,

964
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,180
 all expectations, all responsibilities.

965
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,020
 Release the shackles of everybody else's expectations.

966
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,660
 Release the shackles of responsibility.

967
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,100
 Just strip it all away,

968
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,500
 and if you can just be your own boss,

969
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,860
 if you can rule your own life,

970
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,180
 if you can just get rid of every responsibility,

971
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,020
 every expectation, every person's choice,

972
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,460
 and just be you, that's freedom.

973
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,180
 The Bible does not describe freedom that way.

974
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,980
 The biblical invitation is not to nakedness

975
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,340
 and the stripping away of all shackles of responsibility.

976
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,140
 It's actually about taking up more responsibility

977
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,420
 than we've ever had.

978
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,540
 But it's not a yoke that is heavy

979
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,500
 and a burden that weighs us down.

980
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,180
 It is, as Jesus described,

981
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,580
 "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,

982
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,980
 "and I will give you rest.

983
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,220
 "I will place my yoke on you, and my yoke is light.

984
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,980
 "My burden is easy."

985
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,100
 And he places it on us.

986
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,100
 In other words, there's a responsibility we have

987
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,780
 to die to ourselves, pick up our cross,

988
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,780
 and follow after Jesus.

989
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:46,220
 The biblical call is not to nothing.

990
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,300
 It is not to be naked.

991
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,940
 The Bible does not call you to a responsibility-free life.

992
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,540
 Come on, church.

993
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,580
 The Bible doesn't call you just to do whatever you want,

994
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,140
 just to wear whatever you want,

995
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,180
 just to kind of work it out,

996
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,580
 just to derobe yourself from everything.

997
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,260
 No, the Bible does call you to recognize

998
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,340
 that you're wearing the wrong clothes,

999
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,340
 to recognize how you've been a part of that

1000
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,380
 and how others have placed that upon you.

1001
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,580
 It does call you to take off the old.

1002
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,540
 Basically says anyone who is in Christ Jesus

1003
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,580
 is a new creation.

1004
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,860
 The old is gone, the new has come.

1005
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,540
 You cannot put new wine into old wine skins.

1006
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,060
 There's this challenge to remove the old,

1007
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,580
 but then there's an invitation

1008
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,540
 not to just stand around naked,

1009
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,420
 but actually to be dressed in the clothes

1010
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,620
 that Christ has paid the price for you for.

1011
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,140
 I love this in Genesis 3.

1012
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,700
 There's this beautiful moment, right?

1013
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,140
 In Genesis 3, here's Adam and Eve.

1014
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,860
 And they're naked and they're unashamed

1015
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,300
 because sin hasn't yet come into the world.

1016
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,780
 So in that time, humanity naked was a good thing.

1017
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,180
 But then sin comes in through their own disobedient choice

1018
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,660
 and they realize suddenly that they're naked.

1019
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,260
 And the Bible tells us that the first thing they do

1020
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,980
 is they're ashamed of their nakedness.

1021
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,180
 And so they decide, okay, I need to cover myself.

1022
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,500
 I need to make myself more presentable to God.

1023
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,980
 I'm going to try my best to put clothes on

1024
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,340
 that I think will earn my kind of relationship back with God.

1025
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
 And so Adam and Eve, they clothe themselves

1026
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,260
 with little fig leaves to cover up

1027
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,780
 some of the parts of their bodies

1028
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,820
 so that they could be more presentable to God.

1029
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,660
 And God shows up.

1030
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,620
 And first of all, because of the whole sin thing,

1031
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,540
 there's a judgment that comes from him on Adam and Eve.

1032
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,260
 But at the end of Genesis 3, he does this beautiful thing.

1033
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,580
 He says, you tried to clothe yourself,

1034
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,620
 that's never going to work.

1035
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:36,660
 And he takes animal skins and he fashions garments for them.

1036
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,100
 And he puts clothes on them.

1037
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,700
 And out of those clothes, Adam and Eve

1038
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,340
 have a restored dignity and grace before the Lord again.

1039
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,380
 See, the Bible does not call you to nakedness

1040
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,460
 and tells you that's freedom.

1041
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,420
 The Bible doesn't call you to realize that you're naked

1042
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,140
 and then challenge you to clothe yourself.

1043
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,380
 As much as you shouldn't wear somebody else's clothes,

1044
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,180
 you also shouldn't try to clothe yourself.

1045
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,460
 You following this, church?

1046
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,220
 As much as you shouldn't wear other people's clothes,

1047
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,620
 you shouldn't try to clothe yourself.

1048
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,660
 You're never going to put on an armor or a battle armor

1049
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,380
 that's going to justify you before God.

1050
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,380
 There is no amount of good works

1051
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,700
 that is going to justify you before God.

1052
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,900
 The only way that takes place

1053
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,700
 is through the righteousness of the blood of Christ

1054
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,100
 that was poured out in his life, death, and resurrection.

1055
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,180
 In our recognition of the sin in our lives,

1056
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,820
 the repentance of that sin, and the receiving of his grace.

1057
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,820
 Then we get clothed like God closes in grace Adam and Eve.

1058
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,060
 Then he comes and clothes our nakedness,

1059
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,340
 our shame with his glory.

1060
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,420
 We begin to wear the righteousness of Christ

1061
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,620
 and we are transformed.

1062
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,500
 Take a look at all of these verses coming up behind me now.

1063
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,220
 This is the flow of scripture in this idea.

1064
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,740
 Isaiah 64, eight starts with,

1065
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,860
 "All of us have become like one who is unclean.

1066
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,940
 "All our righteous acts are like filthy rags."

1067
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,020
 We can't wear clothes that are going to justify us

1068
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,100
 back in a relationship with God.

1069
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,780
 Then Isaiah 61, 10, "I delight greatly in the Lord,

1070
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,500
 "for my soul rejoices in my God,

1071
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,700
 "for he has clothed me with garments of salvation

1072
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,100
 "and arrayed me in robes of his righteousness."

1073
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,780
 I'm going to, I love 24, 49,

1074
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,060
 "I'm going to send you what my father has promised,

1075
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,740
 "but stay in the city until you've been clothed

1076
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,220
 "with power on high."

1077
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,980
 Galatians 3, 27, "For all of you who have been baptized

1078
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,940
 "into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ."

1079
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,900
 Even in 2 Corinthians, "Meanwhile, we groan,

1080
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,700
 "longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling,

1081
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,860
 "because when we are clothed, we are not found naked."

1082
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,940
 Amen.

1083
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,900
 The call is not to nakedness.

1084
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,100
 The call is to a responsibility,

1085
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,060
 to live in the way that Christ has called you to live,

1086
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,460
 through his mercy and his grace,

1087
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,180
 his forgiveness placed on you.

1088
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:50,100
 You are to remove the expectations and choices

1089
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,340
 and decisions that have falsely been placed on you,

1090
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,600
 either by others, whether with good intention or bad,

1091
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,740
 or by yourself on your shoulders.

1092
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,060
 You are to remove those things, not be naked,

1093
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,620
 but then in your nakedness, come to the Lord and say,

1094
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,100
 "Would you clothe me in righteousness,

1095
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,840
 "that I believe that your blood clothes me

1096
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,940
 "in righteousness."

1097
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,180
 So I want you to see the process as we close,

1098
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,180
 what David does here.

1099
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,500
 He does three things.

1100
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,340
 He realizes he's wearing the wrong clothes.

1101
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,380
 He removes the clothes,

1102
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,700
 and then he receives the right garments,

1103
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,500
 the ones that he had been given at the very beginning

1104
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,320
 to wear, his true identity, as God has called him,

1105
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,160
 to be a shepherd.

1106
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,500
 And he would go on to be a shepherd king.

1107
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,860
 He would go on to lead his people much through the wisdom

1108
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,860
 that he gained when he was in that time of being a shepherd.

1109
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,060
 And so for you, some of you here are living

1110
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,640
 somebody else's story.

1111
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,180
 Whenever you do that, here's what happens.

1112
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,520
 You become a poor imitation of somebody else's life.

1113
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,900
 Some of us here have been weighed down way too much

1114
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,700
 with good intended responsibility,

1115
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,760
 expectation from others, and we've carried it around

1116
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,020
 and decided that's the life we're going to live.

1117
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,780
 And Christ says, "I've got a story for you to write,

1118
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,880
 "but in order for you to write it,

1119
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,580
 "you've got to be dressed in your clothes."

1120
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,540
 Or you're in the right battle,

1121
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,020
 but you're wearing the wrong clothes.

1122
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,920
 You need to come and receive what it is

1123
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,460
 that I've custom made, tailor made for you.

1124
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,660
 And in these clothes, you will find true life.

1125
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,860
 You'll be able to realize that you're not always wearing

1126
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,060
 what it is that you should wear,

1127
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,420
 and you'll take ownership in removing those things.

1128
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,020
 And in removing them, you take action before the Lord,

1129
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,020
 and you take what is rightfully his onto yourself.

1130
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,060
 And in receiving, you take responsibility then

1131
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,260
 to live the life that Christ has called you to live.

1132
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,800
 That three-part process is what I believe

1133
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,700
 sets David up for success before Goliath.

1134
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,620
 And sure, he was good with that sling,

1135
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,540
 and he was smart with how he did it,

1136
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,820
 but the decision he made to remove Saul's clothes

1137
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,940
 was the reason why on the battlefield

1138
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,860
 he could truly be used by God.

1139
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,020
 It'll be the same for you.

1140
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,280
 And for you here today, some of you don't wanna leave

1141
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,100
 this place until you've done some of that processing work

1142
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,640
 with the Lord, realizing what it is

1143
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,940
 that you might be wearing.

1144
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,000
 For some of us here in this room,

1145
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,820
 it's come from our parents.

1146
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,340
 And our parents are amazing people,

1147
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,020
 and just like Saul, all the best intentions.

1148
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,000
 They wanted the best for you.

1149
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,700
 They wanted you to live the best life,

1150
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,800
 and yet they've placed expectations on you

1151
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,580
 that have been a weight and a burden.

1152
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,840
 I believe the Holy Spirit can release that from you today.

1153
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,460
 Some of us here as parents, perhaps this is real for us.

1154
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,540
 We recognize that we've placed some of that weight

1155
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,260
 on others, and maybe the invitation for the work

1156
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,140
 of the Holy Spirit today for us is just to come

1157
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,620
 and ask him to free us of that guilt,

1158
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,660
 or free us of that shame that we might be carrying

1159
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,500
 that makes us feel like maybe I've done that to others.

1160
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,140
 Just ask him to forgive us and make us new.

1161
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,180
 Some of you in this room, you've chosen to put stuff on

1162
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,020
 because you've wanted to be like everybody else.

1163
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,220
 You haven't wanted to be alone.

1164
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,300
 You've wanted to fit in.

1165
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,480
 You wanted to be accepted, and so you've chosen

1166
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,460
 to place on your shoulders how you think other people

1167
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,940
 want you to act so that you would be accepted,

1168
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,700
 loved, and fitted in to those around you.

1169
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,960
 And perhaps today, it's the bravery that David had

1170
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,280
 to say, "I cannot go in these,"

1171
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,240
 and then pick up the true righteousness of Christ

1172
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,340
 that has been provided for you so that you can put on

1173
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,360
 the very thing that was tailor-made, custom-made,

1174
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,840
 so it would fit perfectly on your body,

1175
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,580
 and you would feel like this was the way

1176
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,680
 I was designed to be.

1177
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,540
 That's the story for you to write in the year ahead.

1178
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,520
 Can I pray for you?

1179
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,360
 Let's pray.

1180
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,860
 Father, I thank you for everybody here.

1181
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:51,340
 Lord, I thank you for the work you're doing

1182
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,480
 in your spirit and by your presence.

1183
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,640
 And Holy Spirit, as we come now to the most important part

1184
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,640
 of the service, we bring you our clothes.

1185
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,140
 And I want you just to take a moment,

1186
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,140
 and if this message has been speaking to you,

1187
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,220
 this is the time where the Holy Spirit wants to begin

1188
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,640
 to speak and do and change and renew for you.

1189
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,940
 Perhaps for some of us here today,

1190
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,980
 we recognize that we have been wearing those oversized

1191
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,740
 jackets of other people's expectations,

1192
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,580
 other people's burdens.

1193
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,260
 We try to be like others too much.

1194
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,060
 Perhaps we've done it from a good place of a good heart,

1195
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,080
 or perhaps we've done it because we wanted to fit in

1196
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,740
 or be accepted.

1197
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,880
 However it might be, we know that we're trying

1198
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,840
 to be more like someone else than the person

1199
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,920
 Christ has called us to be.

1200
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,680
 And because of that, you're living right now

1201
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,740
 somebody else's story and not your own.

1202
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:53,440
 So whilst our eyes are closed, I wanna just pray

1203
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,840
 if you would like the ministry of the Holy Spirit

1204
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,440
 to help you to realize the clothes that you're wearing,

1205
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,920
 to give you the courage to remove them,

1206
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,900
 and then put you in a place to receive once again

1207
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,000
 the forgiveness and the mercy and the righteousness

1208
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,320
 of Christ for you.

1209
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,440
 Maybe just as our eyes are closed,

1210
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,800
 you just open your hands where you are.

1211
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,900
 And I just wanna pray for you each,

1212
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,680
 whether you're in the overflow, watching online,

1213
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,280
 whether you're in this room, as your hands are open,

1214
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,760
 you're saying, "Lord, I realize that there are just

1215
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,960
 "too many clothes on me."

1216
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,640
 Some of you in this room, I wanna repeat it,

1217
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,100
 are wearing too clothes.

1218
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,520
 You're trying to embrace the values of the world

1219
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,500
 on the one hand, and then the values of Christ on the other.

1220
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,480
 You cannot live that way.

1221
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,160
 And if that is you, then this is a time

1222
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,300
 of repentance for you.

1223
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,480
 The Bible says His kindness leads us to that place

1224
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,760
 of repentance, and maybe it's just an encouragement

1225
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,200
 to ask the Lord to just be at work in your heart

1226
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,420
 and to say, "Lord, I wanna ask for your forgiveness.

1227
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,840
 "I don't wanna wear two jackets anymore.

1228
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,320
 "I'm tired of it.

1229
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,400
 "But Lord, I'm gonna need strength,

1230
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,000
 "'cause it's not easy when I'm in that workplace.

1231
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,560
 "It's not easy when I'm out having drinks with my friends.

1232
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,660
 "It's not easy when that's happening.

1233
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,300
 "And it's so easy for me to slip back into the old jacket.

1234
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,780
 "Lord, would you give me strength and courage

1235
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,860
 "to stand apart, to be holy, to pick up that cross,

1236
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,360
 "to wear it daily?

1237
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,160
 "Lord, would you help me?

1238
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,280
 "'Cause I know that in my own strength,

1239
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,240
 "I'll just fail again."

1240
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,480
 Some of you just need to ask Jesus to help.

1241
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,480
 (gentle music)

1242
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,480
 And maybe for some of you, it's just this joy of knowing

1243
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,560
 that you are to write a new story this year,

1244
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,280
 and that you are to move forward

1245
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,440
 in the righteousness of Christ, as he's called you to do.

1246
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,120
 So Holy Spirit, for whatever reason,

1247
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,120
 for those whose hands are open now, come, Lord Jesus, come.

1248
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:52,180
 Just receive from him.

1249
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,120
 He loves you so much.

1250
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,200
 There's so much joy in his heart for you right now,

1251
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,040
 'cause he's looking on you and he's seeing the future

1252
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,480
 and he's seeing the potential, and he's like,

1253
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,920
 "Oh man, this is gonna be amazing."

1254
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,220
 He's like looking at you and saying,

1255
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,640
 "Man, there's a David who's gonna be running

1256
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,340
 "towards their Goliaths this year,

1257
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:15,360
 "in the right battle, wearing the right clothes."

1258
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,060
 So come, Lord Jesus, come.

1259
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:23,520
 Just come, Lord Jesus.

1260
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,280
 Thank you for your goodness to us.

1261
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,480
 Thank you for your love.

1262
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,240
 Just take some time to receive from him.

1263
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,660
 (soft music)

1264
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,080
 (soft music)
