[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   I have a question for you all.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.280]   Who here, by show of hands please,
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.880]   who here watches Netflix?
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.840]   Okay, great.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.800]   So my husband and I love a good show,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.680]   and as new parents, we're not really able to watch
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.720]   as we used to, but when we get those little moments,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.960]   and we get the chance to just sit down and unwind,
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   we really love a good British limited series.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   Yeah, right?
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.160]   They're usually really short,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.600]   they're jam-packed with cliffhangers, amazing storylines,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.520]   and they sort of leave you at the edge of your seat,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400]   like, what's gonna happen next?
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.080]   What's gonna happen to this person?
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.720]   But at the end of the series,
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.640]   there's always a bit of a sigh,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.760]   and that's just it, it's over.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.480]   And now funnily enough, there's a little series
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.840]   or a two-parter in the Bible,
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.760]   and we've been looking at part one of it
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.520]   for the last few weeks.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.320]   It's written by Luke, both the Book of Luke and Acts
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.360]   are part of the same series, and they're both about Jesus.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.600]   And trust me, it's more than your average Netflix show.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.120]   Part one, the Book of Luke, as you may have noticed,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.200]   speaks about the anticipation of the coming Christ,
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.560]   his birth, his miracles, his death, and his resurrection.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.560]   And it's all from eyewitness accounts.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.240]   Part two in the Book of Acts is what happens
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.000]   after Jesus ascends into heaven,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.480]   the Holy Spirit overtakes, and how the word of God,
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.480]   the gospel, spreads from Jerusalem to the rest of the world.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.600]   And trust me, if you've read Acts,
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.200]   you know there's no shortage of extraordinary miracles
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.880]   and a show of the power of God.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.040]   Now, I mentioned Netflix earlier
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.440]   because there's often the temptation
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.600]   to look at the Bible the same way we look at a film
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.880]   or a series.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.160]   It's entertaining whilst we're watching it,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160]   like in the moment, and maybe you talk about it
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   a little bit afterwards, but it fades very, very quickly.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.200]   It's like it fades into the box of memories
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.680]   of many, many other films that you've seen
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.160]   and that you've watched.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.400]   So as we continue to look through Luke today,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.600]   I wanna challenge us not to do the same thing.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.520]   Let's not look at the word of God
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.320]   like we do a film or a show on Netflix,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.480]   where we're engaged in the moment
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.640]   and then we forget all about it as soon as we finish,
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.800]   where we don't apply what we've read into our own lives
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.400]   and we make the mistake of looking at the Bible
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.720]   as some sort of fictional story.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   The word of God is true.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.800]   The word of God is life-changing,
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.600]   and it should be read with the expectation
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.080]   that every time we open it, God has something to say
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.480]   and he wants to meet with us.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.000]   So have this in mind as we look at the text today.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.120]   The word of God is true.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.280]   The word of God changes lives.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.520]   It always, always, always, always brings freedom,
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.640]   and it goes far beyond us.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.880]   It never returns to him void.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.360]   Last week, Chapman took us through Mary's song,
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.280]   and today we're gonna take a look at Zechariah's song.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.360]   I'm gonna read a little bit before that
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.560]   so we get a better picture of what has happened
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.960]   and what brings him to actually sing.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.080]   It's quite a long one,
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.360]   but I do think it's important to read the whole thing
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.240]   so then we can dive into it a little bit deeper.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.240]   So it's in Luke 1, verse 57 to 80, and it reads,
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.040]   "When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby,
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.240]   "she gave birth to a son.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.880]   "Her neighbors and relatives heard
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.640]   "that the Lord had shown her great mercy,
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.800]   "and they shared her joy.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.360]   "On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child,
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.800]   "and they were going to name him
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.040]   "after his father, Zechariah.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.760]   "But his mother spoke up and said,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.600]   "'No, he is to be called John.'
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.640]   "They said to her,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.120]   "'There is no one among your relatives who has that name.'
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.320]   "Then they made signs to his father
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.120]   "to find out what he would like to name the child.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.400]   "He asked for a writing tablet,
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.500]   "and to everyone's astonishment, he wrote,
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.040]   "'His name is John.'
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.280]   "Immediately, his mouth was opened and his tongue set free,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.040]   "and he began to speak, praising God.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.120]   "All the neighbors were filled with awe,
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.960]   "and throughout the hill country and Judea,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.360]   "people were talking about all these things.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.720]   "Everyone who had heard this wondered about it,
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.420]   "asking, 'What then is this child going to be?'
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.220]   "For the Lord's hand was with him."
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.760]   Verse 67, now we're getting into the song.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.960]   His father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.620]   and prophesied, "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.140]   "because he has come to his people and redeemed them.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.680]   "He has raised up a horn of salvation for us
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.840]   "in the house of his servant David,
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.780]   "as he said through his holy prophets long ago,
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.460]   "salvation from our enemies and from the hand
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.100]   "of all who hate us, to show mercy to our ancestors
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.700]   "and to remember his holy covenant.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.360]   "The oath he swore to our father Abraham,
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.680]   "to rescue us from the hand of our enemies
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.900]   "and to enable us to serve him without fear,
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.940]   "in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.060]   "And you, my child, will be called a prophet
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.360]   "of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.220]   "to prepare the way for him, to give his people
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.840]   "the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.700]   "of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God,
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.940]   "by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven,
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.480]   "to shine on those living in darkness
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.140]   "and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.960]   "into the path of peace."
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.140]   And the child grew and became strong in spirit,
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.860]   and he lived in the wilderness
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.220]   until he appeared publicly to Israel.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.040]   Amen.
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.300]   So, from this verses, it's really clear to see
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.780]   that God is at work.
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.100]   A few weeks ago, we saw Mary's encounter with the angel,
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.780]   and we also saw Zechariah's, all within the same time
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.420]   period, not centuries apart.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.620]   And we also saw how they both responded.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.220]   Mary welcomed the word of the Lord,
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.220]   I am your servant, while Zechariah doubted,
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.540]   how can I be sure of this?
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.720]   His doubt actually echoes another story
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.880]   in the Old Testament.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.200]   It's quite similar to this one, in terms of barrenness
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.880]   and waiting on the Lord.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.120]   We read in Genesis 18, that Sarah had a similar reaction
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.080]   when she heard that she would have a child in her old age.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.200]   In fact, she thought it was so ridiculous that she laughed.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.880]   Now, can you imagine your grandma,
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.080]   actually, your great grandma, telling you she's pregnant,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.500]   she's about to have a baby?
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.000]   [laughing]
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.760]   You would probably laugh and think it was a joke, too.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.680]   But the Lord says to Abraham, in verse 14,
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.960]   is anything too hard for the Lord?
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.680]   Sarah was past childbearing age,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.280]   and it really didn't seem like a feasible task.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.200]   But this was a reminder that if God says it,
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.860]   he can and he will do it.
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.480]   Nothing is impossible for God,
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.600]   which is the same message that we get here in Luke
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.520]   and in many other parts of the Bible.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.760]   So this was said by the angel to Elizabeth.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.760]   For no word from God will ever fail.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.740]   Even Elizabeth, your relative,
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.600]   is going to have a child in her old age,
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.580]   and she who was said to be unable to conceive
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.140]   is in her sixth month.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.240]   I'll say it again.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.440]   For no word from God will ever fail.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.760]   And in the book of Isaiah, this is from the Lord himself.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.160]   So it is my word that goes out from my mouth.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.080]   It will not return to me empty,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.040]   but will accomplish what I desire
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.480]   and achieve the purpose for which I have sent it.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.600]   Once he has spoken, we can be sure that he will fulfill it,
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.320]   and ultimately, everything is fulfilled
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.320]   in the person of Jesus.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.720]   Now, a few weeks back,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.320]   we saw how Zechariah's mouth was actually muted.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.880]   He doubted the word of the Lord
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.000]   that was spoken to him by the angel,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.720]   and then he was unable to speak
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.760]   until after his son was born.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.880]   But even in his silence,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.880]   he was able to declare that which God had already spoken.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.480]   As baby John was getting circumcised,
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.960]   eight days after his birth,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.560]   he was asked what the child's name was,
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.940]   and instead of what was common practice,
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.080]   naming the child after a relative,
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.680]   he broke the mold and did something very different.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.000]   He chose in that moment to walk in obedience
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.720]   and follow the instructions that were given to him
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.080]   by the angel.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.240]   And though he doubted at the beginning, he did,
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.560]   he also saw God's word come to pass.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.960]   He saw that, indeed, Elizabeth became pregnant.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.680]   He saw that she had given birth to their son,
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.960]   and that their old age meant nothing
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.480]   because God had said it, and the miracle was done.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.280]   Just as it was done for Abraham centuries before,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.120]   God was doing it again,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.440]   and now all eyes were on Zechariah.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.240]   What are you going to name this boy?
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.320]   And Zechariah decided to follow what the Lord had said,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   and as soon as he wrote down his name as John,
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.140]   it says, immediately, his mouth was opened
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.000]   and his tongue set free,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.980]   and he began to speak, praising God.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.980]   Now, declaring the word of the Lord brings freedom.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.120]   In Zechariah's case, it was freedom of his tongue
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.800]   and having the ability to speak again.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.020]   We also see God's word bringing freedom
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.940]   to the children of Israel in the book of Exodus.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.860]   The Israelites were slaves in Egypt
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.800]   and longed for their freedom,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.100]   and as Moses continually spoke to Pharaoh,
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.580]   declaring God's words,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.340]   let my people go so they may worship me,
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.460]   the power of God broke through,
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.780]   and the Israelites were set free.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.860]   When we speak God's word, his truth,
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.220]   into situations, there is always freedom,
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.820]   whether it be physical freedom,
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.740]   spiritual, or freedom from sin.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.960]   Now, if you're an old man,
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.620]   you've got no children,
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.640]   you've been praying and waiting for decades,
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.860]   probably going to the temple on a regular basis
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.740]   and just waiting on God.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.440]   We know that being childless was looked down upon
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.580]   because we see Elizabeth's words in verse 25.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.380]   He has shown me favor
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.380]   and taken away my disgrace among the people.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.260]   And it finally happens.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.140]   The Lord does this great thing,
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.180]   and after months of not being able to speak,
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.940]   what would be the first words out of your mouth?
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.940]   I know for me, I might be a little bit sour at first.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.980]   Not being able to speak for all that time
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.900]   throughout the pregnancy of our first child,
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.900]   there must have been so many moments
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.220]   that he wanted to just exclaim,
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.540]   you know, feeling that first kick, all sorts of things.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.140]   Or maybe just so excited about this miracle
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.660]   that I'd be so obsessed with my baby,
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.140]   which is often the case,
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.940]   and the prayers and the praise to God comes later.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.060]   But Zechariah doesn't speak about John.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.100]   He doesn't even speak about his wife,
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.900]   but immediately praises God.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.960]   And what follows is incredible.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.940]   His father, Zechariah,
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.220]   was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.900]   And to prophesy is to speak about things that are to come.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.060]   So events that haven't happened,
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.580]   but certainly will in the future.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.420]   It's not fortune telling.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.440]   It's none of this weird new age stuff
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.060]   that you hear about today.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.620]   No tarot cards, no odd practices.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.340]   It's nothing to do with our own strength.
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.820]   It's always, prophecies that come from God are always true,
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.660]   and they always happen at their appointed time.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.880]   And at this time,
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.500]   the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen on all men.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.140]   So there are moments throughout the Old Testament
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.020]   where you see people are overpowered,
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.980]   empowered by the Holy Spirit to do something or to speak.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.620]   But we need to be aware
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.080]   that it isn't like what we experience today,
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.980]   where we can lay hands on each other
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.960]   and ask for a filling of the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.580]   This was something that came much later.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.260]   And there's a prophecy in Joel
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.100]   that speaks about these days,
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.380]   the days that we are actually living in today.
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.020]   What a privilege.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.460]   So what we read in Luke
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.000]   is actually an anticipation of what is to come.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.620]   It's little glimpses of the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.380]   The angel said John would be filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.100]   even before his birth.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.180]   And we see that Elizabeth gets filled
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.500]   with the Holy Spirit in verse 41.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.300]   And now, Zechariah.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.500]   We know today that the filling of the Spirit
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.700]   often accompanies a great move of God.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.540]   In the book of Acts 2,
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.360]   after the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.220]   they go out healing the sick, speaking in tongues,
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.340]   casting out demons, and doing all sorts of things
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.700]   in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.180]   And we have the ability to look back on these things.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.140]   And as we put our faith in Jesus now,
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.180]   we can also be filled with the same Holy Spirit.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.620]   But here, Zechariah's looking ahead.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.100]   He's speaking of things that haven't actually happened.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.660]   Things he had heard by word of mouth
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.580]   or by reading the scrolls.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.380]   So verses 68 to 65.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.900]   Let's have a little look.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.700]   Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.820]   because he has come to his people and redeemed them.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.180]   He's raised up a horn of salvation for us
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.440]   in the house of his servant David,
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.740]   as he said through his holy prophets of long ago.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.220]   Salvation from our enemies
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.500]   and from the hand of all who hate us.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.420]   To show mercy to our ancestors
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.660]   and to remember his holy covenant,
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.320]   the oath he swore our father Abraham.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.540]   To rescue us from the hand of our enemies
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.180]   and to enable us to serve him without fear
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.580]   in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.860]   Zechariah is pointing to the coming Christ
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.380]   in this prophecy.
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:11.140]   He's sent to earth to redeem and save mankind,
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.460]   the most important event in our history.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.680]   That through the family of David,
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.580]   a revered king amongst the Israelites,
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.980]   the ultimate king Jesus would come
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.300]   and fulfill the word of God.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.700]   That all the Old Testament prophecies,
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.300]   all the words that God spoke before
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.420]   through the prophets would come to pass.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.060]   So in case you missed it,
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.980]   this prophecy is all about Jesus.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.980]   And we know that it is true
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.580]   because all of this has actually happened.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.380]   Just as he said it would.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.860]   Everything is about him.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.980]   Zechariah realized that his own life,
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.920]   the birth of John, the surrounding events,
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.280]   they were all part of a greater story.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.860]   By praising the Lord,
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.980]   he actively participated in the move of God
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.420]   and what he was doing at that time.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.580]   He didn't look at his own life,
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.640]   nor did he focus on the birth of his son
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.220]   or put that at the forefront.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.860]   All of that was secondary.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.240]   He knew that greater things were to come.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.540]   His humility opened him up to seeing
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.740]   that he was not the main character.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.820]   And surprise, surprise guys,
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.020]   neither are we.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.940]   Even in our own lives,
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.700]   our stories are no longer about us.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.460]   The minute we become Christians,
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.680]   we often say we've given our lives to Christ.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.040]   He becomes the first and the last.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.960]   And we surrender everything to him.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.720]   We give him the praise,
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.400]   we give him the honor.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.200]   Colossians 3 says we do everything as unto the Lord.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.560]   So that's your work life,
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.960]   the way you speak to each other,
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.760]   your family, what we put in our bodies,
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.200]   everything is for him and about him.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.040]   So we are no longer the main characters.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.620]   Now, I'm gonna take you back
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.880]   to our little Netflix example.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.960]   By show of hands, please,
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.100]   have a good look at these four guys.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.940]   I'm gonna point to one and I'm gonna ask
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.540]   how many people recognize this person.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.960]   So I'm gonna start with this guy.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.580]   Show of hands, how many of you have ever seen this man?
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.420]   Okay.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.120]   This guy.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.060]   Oh yeah.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.860]   This guy.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.500]   Maybe.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.220]   This guy.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.160]   (laughing)
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.720]   That was the response I was hoping for, guys.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.620]   That was the response I was hoping for.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.880]   Now, you only recognize these two guys.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.640]   This one here, this one.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.200]   A few, maybe like three people recognize this guy.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.960]   This guy, no one recognized this guy, which is great.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.520]   (laughing)
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.520]   So you recognize these two the most
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.040]   because they are the main characters in their films.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.440]   They're the main actors.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.640]   So the storylines are centered around them,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.500]   their lives, there might be some random love interest
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.320]   in there or something.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.480]   But for the most part, everything is about those guys.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.860]   And it's interesting how they manage to keep us interested
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.880]   and invested in this character throughout the whole film.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.240]   The other two guys, you ask, never seen them before?
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.720]   Nope, I had never seen them either
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.360]   until I started preparing for this sermon.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.520]   And that's because they are actually stunt doubles.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.560]   So a stunt double is a trained professional
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.920]   who stands in for an actor to perform dangerous
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.000]   or demanding tasks.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.160]   So, obviously, you won't see the actual Daniel Craig
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:16.720]   jumping out of a helicopter or a building.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.840]   It will be a stunt double.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.080]   The two guys from the previous slides
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.280]   were their stunt doubles.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.200]   So those are the people that will be doing
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.840]   all the dangerous things.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.960]   Yeah, so the actor does the majority of the film
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.560]   with no regard for the stunt double.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.960]   All of the easy things, goes about his business.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.800]   But when he or she comes to that scene
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.200]   that requires a bit more strength,
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.640]   that's a bit dangerous, could cause a bit of harm or pain,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.680]   they just step aside, let the stunt double come and do it,
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.680]   and they do it to perfection.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.280]   But they're always in the background.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.520]   No one ever knows there was a stunt double.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.000]   It happens so quickly, and there's never a pause
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.240]   in the film that says,
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.200]   "This stunt was performed by a stunt double."
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.440]   Never, ever happens.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.040]   And if you don't know much about films,
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.320]   or you blink a bit too quickly,
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.880]   you may assume that it was the main actor who did it.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.560]   And all of the awards, all of the accolades,
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.680]   go to the main actor.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.200]   There is not an Oscar for stunt doubles.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.400]   Surprise, surprise.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.440]   - There should be, right?
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.400]   - There should be, right?
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.240]   But there isn't.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.440]   (laughing)
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.680]   Now, think about your own life for a second.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.320]   How many times have we been the main characters
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.880]   in our own stories,
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.840]   and relegated God to our stunt double?
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.120]   We call him when times are tough.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.320]   He comes in, he does the job,
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.280]   and then we push him to the background.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.880]   No praise, no honor, no recognition.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.600]   It's all about us.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.440]   And as I was preparing for this sermon,
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.720]   I actually had to humble myself and repent,
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.760]   because I realized that I was doing the exact same thing.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.000]   I was in two minds about doing this sermon.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.280]   And I had like a million questions.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.480]   I've narrowed them down.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.080]   Should I?
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.800]   Shouldn't I?
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.560]   All eyes on me.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.800]   I may not be able to just fade into the background
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.400]   after doing this.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.560]   I don't particularly like speaking in public.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.280]   What if I say the wrong thing?
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.240]   I'm not a pastor.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.720]   Should I be preaching?
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.120]   Now, let's look at those questions again.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.880]   And I've made all of the I's and all of the me's bold.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.440]   So we can all count it together.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.440]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.360]   Eight times.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.720]   And trust me, I had way more questions.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.800]   There's way more I's and me's.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.640]   Loads more.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.200]   So how many times did I talk about myself?
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.040]   - Eight times.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.080]   - How many times did I mention God?
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.280]   How many times did I mention His will?
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.400]   What He has to say?
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   I had made preaching and declaring His word all about me.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:17.240]   And we often go about life in this exact same way.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.520]   We live for ourselves.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.440]   We wake up in the morning, it's about our kids,
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.040]   our spouses, our jobs, what we're gonna eat,
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.360]   what we're gonna wear, what will people think of us,
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.440]   where we need to be, what we need to do.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.440]   We often don't even consider what God has for us each day.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.680]   And we go through the motions, doing life,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.320]   going through the script, saying our lines,
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.400]   until we get to the crossroad
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.120]   where we need our trusted stunt double.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.520]   And in preparing for this sermon,
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.800]   perhaps my mindset should have been this instead.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:01.000]   What does God want to share with His church?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.120]   How will He use me?
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.720]   I'm gonna read that again.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.320]   What does God want to share with His church?
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.120]   How will God, how will He use me?
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.880]   See, once you change your perspective
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.520]   and you shift your gaze to Him,
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.000]   you realize that it isn't about you.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.560]   You are not the main character.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.240]   He is.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.240]   And it is about what He wants to do in and through you.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.240]   Now, Zachariah had the right idea.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.760]   He made God the center
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.720]   and had set his eyes on the things above.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.160]   Luke 1:6 says, "He and Elizabeth were righteous
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.700]   "in the sight of God, observing His commands blamelessly,
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.040]   "and even after doubting, He was obedient
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.940]   "and followed the word of the Lord,
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.060]   "praising God and looking to Him as the most important."
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.560]   What he had just experienced was an afterthought.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.720]   When he looked ahead at what was to come,
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.800]   all of the prophecies of old were about to be seen
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.640]   in his day, and his son would prepare the way
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.200]   for the Messiah, the Christ, the Redeemer,
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   the horn or the strength of salvation.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.600]   He would see scriptures that he had heard
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.240]   as a boy fulfilled.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.560]   And only after he speaks about Christ
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.380]   does he mention John, his son.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.040]   Jesus was always first.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.080]   And when we believe in God and we believe in His words
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:58.080]   and we're obedient to Him, we make Him the main character,
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.920]   just like Zachariah did.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.640]   As we build our lives on Him,
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.400]   He becomes the center and we become a part
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.360]   of the big story that He is writing.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.120]   (pages rustling)
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.140]   Let's just take 10 seconds
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.460]   and just have a think about that last part.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:30.320]   As we build our lives on Him, He becomes the center.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   We become a part of the big story that He is writing.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.060]   (pages rustling)
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:51.900]   Can we just call up the worship team?
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:59.600]   So I want us to have a think about our own lives.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.460]   How do we see Jesus?
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.080]   Is He the main character?
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.480]   Are we part of His great story?
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.940]   Or is He a tiny part of ours, like a stunt double?
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:22.640]   So there's this worship song that I absolutely adore
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.980]   and it goes like this.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.240]   I'm not gonna sing, by the way.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.480]   (laughing)
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.280]   No, I'm not gonna break into song.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.720]   It seemed like a moment, right?
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.560]   No, no, no.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.740]   (laughing)
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.500]   I'm gonna read the words.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.960]   (laughing)
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.800]   No, no, no.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.380]   (laughing)
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.400]   It says, "Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.700]   "Look full in His wonderful face
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.640]   "and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:59.260]   "in the light of His glory and grace."
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.460]   I'm gonna read it again.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.780]   "Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.700]   "Look full in His wonderful face
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:13.700]   "and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:19.400]   "in the light of His glory and grace."
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.660]   If we can all just close our eyes for a second.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.580]   (soft piano music)
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:47.940]   Lord, help us to fix our eyes on you.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:53.220]   To turn our eyes to you for all of our needs.
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:58.780]   To look to you as our source of strength and peace,
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.940]   our guide, our help in times of trouble,
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.020]   but also in times of blessing.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:10.020]   That we will not forget that you are the main character.
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.140]   That our lives are about you and bringing you glory.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:19.260]   And that when we start to look up to God,
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.540]   instead of looking ahead on earth,
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.140]   the things that aren't important to God
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.960]   really do fade away.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:33.220]   Our fleshly desires, our pride, our selfish ways,
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.500]   and we start to love God more and love His people.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.580]   It's all about you, Lord.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.860]   Lord, in our finances,
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.460]   we ask that you would help to steward
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.180]   what you have given us.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.380]   In our homes, Lord,
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.860]   we would ask how we can honour you with our children,
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.260]   with our spouses and relatives.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:03.220]   In our workplaces,
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.140]   we would ask how we can glorify you
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.820]   in our behaviour towards our colleagues and our bosses.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.300]   In our serving, Lord,
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:19.100]   we would humble ourselves and see our giftings
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:24.100]   as a way to build up your church body and praise you.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:28.340]   On our commute to work, Lord,
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.740]   we would ask how can I show God's love?
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.820]   Giving up my seat, perhaps?
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.860]   Very rare.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:43.100]   There are so many areas of our lives
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.780]   that we need your help, God.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.740]   We don't want to be the main character, Lord.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.460]   That's your job.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:56.020]   And Lord, help us to do it joyfully.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.300]   Lord, there is joy in serving you.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.460]   There is joy in giving our lives to you, Lord.
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:10.740]   Let's just take a moment.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.380]   If anything is coming up,
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.500]   if God is pointing out anything
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.180]   that you may need to repent of,
