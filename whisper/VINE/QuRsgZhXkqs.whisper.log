[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   Well, we only have three weeks left in our Exodus series.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.120]   Can you believe it?
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.360]   Only three more weeks to go,
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.840]   and it's been an epic journey.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.960]   This is week 22 of the series,
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.120]   and if you've been with us,
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.680]   even for just a portion of the series,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.080]   I'm sure that you felt challenged by God
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.120]   in the areas that He wants to meet you,
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.320]   grow you, stretch you, challenge you,
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.760]   the way He wants to shape and form you
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.680]   to be more like Him.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.800]   And in particular, the way that He wants to continue
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.440]   to purge out of us some of the brokenness
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.600]   that it's so easy for us to carry around with us.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.780]   And as we enter into the final three weeks of the series,
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.480]   we're really entering into what I would consider
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.840]   the core teachings of what this whole series has been about.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.920]   So if this is your first time to the Exodus series,
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.320]   you've just saved yourselves 22 weeks, well done.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.480]   I encourage you to go back and have a listen.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.760]   But these final three weeks are really,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.880]   God welcomed us into the very things
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.560]   that He's been preparing you for.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.480]   And so if you've been part of this journey
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.140]   for whatever amount of time that may be for you,
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.600]   these three weeks, I think, are the most fundamental,
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.480]   where all the threads that God has been doing
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.200]   throughout this story are gonna be tied together.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.040]   And this week begins it
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.600]   off the back of what we saw happen last week.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.680]   Last week, we were in chapter 32 of Exodus,
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.880]   perhaps the hardest, most brutal chapter of the whole story,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.160]   where just off the back of this incredible experience
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.960]   with God on the mountain and God's presence with His people
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.680]   and the giving of the law
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.200]   and the very second commandment not to commit idolatry.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200]   In chapter 32, we see Israel do that very thing,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.560]   the very thing that God had called them not to do,
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.640]   they enter into.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.920]   And they take the gold that they had taken
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.520]   and plundered from Egypt, and they burn the gold down
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.640]   and they fashion a golden calf,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.640]   and they set the golden calf up as something to worship
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.360]   because it was tangible to them,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.020]   where God seemed intangible, God seemed far away,
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.280]   God seemed this scary thing on a mountain.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.040]   They wanted to create a golden animal
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.960]   so they could worship something that was more concrete
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.500]   and tangible for them.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.560]   And I said last week that what we see in that story
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.160]   are three temptations that every church community faces.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.880]   And I would say three temptations,
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.600]   particularly that we here at the Vine face.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   And that is the temptation to finish in the flesh
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.980]   the very things that God starts in the spirit,
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.160]   the temptation to turn our place of worship
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.480]   into our object of worship,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.840]   and the temptation to recast God
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.260]   into a version that we can handle,
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.520]   a version that fits, if you will, within our comfort levels.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.120]   And all three of those temptations
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.180]   are idolatries in and of themselves.
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.280]   But I want you to see, and really today is a part two
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.760]   of the message from last week,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.580]   I want you to see what these three idolatries
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.680]   will move every church into.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.520]   All three of these have the power to strip a church
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.320]   of the very one thing that gives that church the power
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.440]   to change and transform the society around it,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.120]   and that is the presence of God.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.360]   You need to understand that the enemy strategies
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.480]   about the idolatries that he tempts us with in the church,
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.720]   all of them are designed to strip the church
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.800]   of the presence of God.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.920]   The enemy does not care about churches
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.360]   that are without the presence of God,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   couldn't care less about them.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.440]   The enemy is not afraid of theological social clubs.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.640]   Come on, church.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.080]   The thing that pushes back the gates of hell
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   is nothing less than the presence of God.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.440]   And the presence of God within a church community
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.520]   and that presence of God within the people
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.600]   of that community and that presence of God
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.320]   going from them and through them and out of them
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.400]   and flowing into the corridors of power
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.520]   and the workplaces that they represent
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.260]   and the families that they have
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.760]   and God's presence operating out of that,
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.000]   bringing peace and love and kindness and goodness
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.800]   and gentleness and faithfulness and self-control,
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.300]   that changes a city.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.080]   And so the reason why God is so upset
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.440]   about Exodus 32 and the golden calf
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.640]   is not just because it reveals
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.840]   what really is truly in our hearts,
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.620]   not just because it shows us
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.080]   that we've broken our covenantal relationship with God.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.400]   The thing that really upsets him
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.040]   is that he knows that idolatry
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.020]   strips his presence from his people.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.960]   And when his presence is stripped from his people,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.240]   his people are stripped from their power
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.960]   'cause the power is not in us.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.480]   Surely the power is in the spirit of God, amen.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.120]   This is why Exodus 33,
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.080]   the chapter that follows Exodus 32
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.600]   and all this stuff about idolatry,
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.920]   Exodus 32, 33, sorry,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.120]   is all about the battle for the presence of God.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.280]   And if there's anything that Exodus
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   and the whole story is brought us to
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.040]   is to the pinpoint, the crossroads, if you will,
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.120]   of this battle.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.920]   Will we fight for the presence of God in our midst
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.680]   or will we choose a different path?
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.960]   It's a question that I think God puts before us
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.120]   as a church community as we draw the series to a close.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.720]   Do we really want his presence?
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.720]   Something like really want his presence.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.220]   Do we really want his presence in our hearts,
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.720]   in our lives, in our families, in our marriages?
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.200]   Like do we really want his presence with us
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.900]   or do we just want the benefits of his presence?
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.440]   I wanna show you this by unpacking Exodus 33.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.120]   It's a bit more of a brighter chapter than Exodus 32
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.400]   so you can be grateful for that.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.280]   But there's some challenges here
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.760]   that are sobering also for us.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.160]   Exodus 33, verse one, look at this.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.800]   Then the Lord said to Moses, "Leave this place,"
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.780]   talking about Mount Sinai,
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.380]   "you and the people who I have brought up out of Egypt
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.880]   "and go up to the land that I promised on oath
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.600]   "to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.980]   "saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.220]   "'I will send an angel before you
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.640]   "'and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.980]   "'the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites,
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.860]   "'the Jebusites, anyites you could ever imagine,
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.240]   "'I'm gonna drive them out.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.960]   "'Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey,
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.440]   "'but I will not go with you
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.140]   "'because you are a stiff-necked people
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.760]   "'and I might destroy you on the way.'"
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.120]   God shows up to Moses and he says this incredible thing.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.880]   He says, "Despite everything that I've just encountered
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.300]   "in Exodus 32, everything about the golden calf,
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.840]   "everything about your idolatry, everything about your sin,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   "despite all of that, I am still going to give you the land.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.280]   "I'm still gonna come through with my promises for you."
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.840]   I mean, I want you to see the depths
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.640]   of the grace of God in this moment.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.740]   That even Israel in their worst moment of sin
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.880]   and brokenness before God and in their relationship with God,
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.420]   God does not remove his promises from them.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.100]   He says, "You will go up, leave this place
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.360]   "and go up to the place that I have provided for you.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.140]   "I still have given you that land, the land of Canaan,
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.060]   "the promised land that he has long been calling them towards."
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.540]   And not only that, but he gift wraps the present.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.920]   He says, "I'm gonna send an angel ahead of you
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.380]   "and that angel is gonna drive out
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.700]   "all the people that are currently living in that land.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.280]   "You're not gonna have to lift a finger.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.120]   "I'm gonna basically roll out the red carpet for you
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.380]   "and you're gonna move into the promised land."
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.380]   And you read that and you think, this is a God of grace.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.740]   Because this is a God who should come
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.940]   and remove everything from his people.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.260]   You guys have screwed up, it's all over.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.740]   And some of you in the room here,
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.740]   that's how you think of God.
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.580]   You think if you've screwed up, it's all over
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.020]   when it comes to your relationship with God.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.100]   You think your brokenness and your sin
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.220]   or the stuff that you've done means
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.700]   that you are on plan D with God, not plan A.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.820]   And God says to his people,
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.100]   "You're not on some plan D here.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.400]   "The exodus is still happening.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.180]   "I've still drawn you out to place you in this land.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.780]   "The promise has not been removed."
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.180]   And that should be an encouragement to some of you here.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.500]   But I want you to see something really clearly.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.580]   He does say this, "But I will not go with you."
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.380]   (laughing)
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.980]   He says, "I'm not gonna go with you."
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.460]   In other words, the cost of idolatry
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.860]   is not the promises of God, it's the presence of God.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.260]   Oh, I'm gonna preach on this one, stay with me.
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.360]   Buckle yourselves in.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.380]   That the cost of idolatry is not the promises of God.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.140]   He's like, "The promise will still stand.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.900]   "I promised that to your forefathers.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.280]   "I promised that you'd ever wait.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.980]   "In fact, I'm gonna send an angel forward
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.900]   "to do all that stuff."
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.220]   The cost though is that I'm not gonna go with you.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.500]   'Cause if I went with you, man, I might.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.220]   I might do some things I don't wanna do.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.800]   So I'm not gonna go with you.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.780]   You can have the promises, but you cannot have me.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.080]   And in that, God is putting a challenge before Israel
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.580]   that I think he's also putting before us here
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.460]   at the Vine in 2023.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.700]   He's asking them a deep, profound question
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.760]   that he wants them to wrestle with.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.820]   He's basically saying this,
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.580]   what is ultimately more important to you?
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.660]   Having God's promises in your life
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.160]   or having God's presence in your life?
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.860]   What is ultimately more important to you?
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.700]   Having my promises in your life
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.100]   or having me in your life?
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.500]   Now on the surface, I know how we're all gonna respond.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.340]   I want God's presence.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.340]   It must be the presence, right?
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.060]   And Pastor Andrew's saying it should be the presence.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.660]   I'm like, well, take the presence.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.500]   I know the natural response for us is to say,
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.020]   presence of God, yes, we want the presence of God.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.980]   But if you're anything like me,
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.380]   which I hope you are sometimes,
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.740]   if you're anything like me,
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.420]   you'll probably realize that if you dig a little bit more
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.820]   below the surface from the cheesy answer
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.440]   that you should give and take a fresh look
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.700]   at your prayer life and your worshiping life
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.460]   and your daily life, you might realize that your answer
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.300]   in your heart is a bit more complex than you might like.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.700]   If you're anything like me,
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.180]   I think we are all susceptible to developing a relationship
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.080]   with God primarily for what God can do for us.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:48.860]   That we pursue God often primarily for his benefits.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.460]   Because my relationship with Jesus means
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.300]   that I will have a better marriage,
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.260]   that I'll have a better relationship with my kids,
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.580]   that I'll have a better work environment,
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.700]   that I'll be more successful,
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.460]   my life will generally be better.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.600]   I'll be a kinder, more naturally loving, a better person.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.820]   Jesus is my guru to help me to live a better life.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.420]   Are you with me?
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.500]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.020]   It is great that you want a better life
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.260]   and a better marriage.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.440]   And God can absolutely help you to have a better marriage,
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.620]   to be better with your kids,
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.540]   to work in your workplace better,
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.740]   to see flourishing happen.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.480]   All of those things, absolutely, God wants for you.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.300]   But I want you to see the subtle danger
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.580]   that idolatry brings.
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.460]   And it is that we think that primarily our relationship
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.940]   with God is based on what God can do for us,
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.820]   the benefits of God, the promises of God,
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.980]   the blessings of God.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.600]   And if we build a relationship with him
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.660]   that is primarily based on what he can do for us,
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.460]   our relationship, our actual relationship
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.140]   is going to suffer.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.400]   Now, let me tell you why it's going to suffer.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.700]   That if the basis or the foundation
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.580]   of your relationship with God is because he blesses you,
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.900]   he's nice to you, he helps you to be a better person.
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.040]   If that's why you worship him,
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.460]   you will ultimately struggle in your relationship with him.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.300]   Why?
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.020]   Because a lot of the benefits we want from God
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.600]   are not objective ones, they're subjective ones.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.420]   They're benefits that we desire, that we want.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.740]   Not the benefit of salvation
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.240]   or the benefit of objective things
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.920]   that change us in our relationship with God.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.080]   Those are amazing.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.700]   But we largely follow him because we want the benefits
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.820]   for us personally.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.900]   Now, here's the issue with that.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.420]   We humans are never satisfied.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.860]   And we humans get really upset at God
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.380]   when he doesn't give us the blessings
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.780]   that we thought he was gonna give us.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.820]   The benefits that we thought was going to come to us.
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.700]   I thought I would be married by now.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.300]   I thought I would have a better job by now.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.940]   I thought my marriage would have been sorted out by now
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.540]   because I believe in Jesus.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.000]   And when our benefits of him are largely subjective,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.480]   even if those are good subjective things,
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.700]   and when those things don't seem to happen in our lives,
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.700]   the thing that actually breaks down
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.840]   is our relationship with God.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.000]   'Cause if your foundation of that relationship
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.360]   is the benefits he brings you,
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.800]   and you perceive that those benefits are not coming,
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.520]   what's gonna be infected by that
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.540]   is your relationship with him.
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.500]   Are you with me?
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.680]   We will drive out the presence of God from our lives
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.280]   if we find our presence with God
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.020]   based on what he does for us.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.880]   He says to Israel, "You can have the promised land,
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.120]   "but if your focus is the promised land,
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.040]   "you will lose me along the way."
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.120]   This is why in Exodus 32,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.080]   we saw Israel enter into idolatry in the very first place.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.200]   They got into idolatry like we saw last week
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.920]   because Moses was so long on the mountain.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.840]   All those timing didn't work out for them.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.200]   The benefit didn't work out for them.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.720]   They weren't sure about their future.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.920]   It was all about them, so they built the golden car.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.720]   And when we find our relationship with God
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.380]   primarily about what he does for us
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.880]   rather than just about him,
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.060]   then we will find ourselves,
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:05.560]   we will find ourselves walking in his promises
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.100]   without his presence, and there is nothing worse than that.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.600]   When you have the promises of God without his presence,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.880]   you have self-help psychology that makes you feel better
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.720]   rather than the transformative power
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.320]   of Jesus Christ in your life
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.280]   that changes you eternally for good.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:28.880]   And so this challenge comes to Israel here in chapter 33,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.280]   and God is saying, "What is it that you are going to choose?"
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.560]   Ultimately, he's saying this.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.840]   "Do you want me, or do you want the things of me?"
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.960]   And that is what all of Exodus has been about.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.160]   It has all been about this one final question.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.560]   Do you really want me, or do you just want the things of me?
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.740]   Because every step of the Exodus journey so far
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.000]   has been God taking his people out of their brokenness
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.400]   and bringing them into a place,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.680]   not just so that they would experience his benefits,
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.920]   not just so that they would know the promised land,
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.040]   not just because of those things.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.360]   God has been drawing them out so that he can draw them in.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.280]   God draws them out so he can draw them in to himself.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.280]   It's all been about him and his presence with them.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.840]   It's all been about the power of him being amongst them.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.600]   It's all been about him coming down to them
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.280]   and living with them and being with them
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.080]   and fostering a life with them.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.000]   It's been about taking all of these benefits
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.480]   so that you could ultimately know who I am.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.120]   But it's not about the benefits, the story.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.920]   The story is about him with his people.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.560]   Are you following me still?
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.720]   And the problem we have in the church
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.920]   is that we forget that story.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.320]   And so often it's easy for us in the church
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.240]   to make our experience of God all about the benefits
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   and we miss completely that it's ultimately about him.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.760]   Whether he blesses me or he does good things for me,
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.200]   whether he achieves all of the subjective things
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.280]   that I want him to achieve in my life,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.000]   he is still worth worshiping.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.400]   That is the heart of what Exodus is all about.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.820]   I think that's the heart that God calls his church to.
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.720]   But if you're anything like me, it's easy to struggle.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.640]   This is why actually Moses writes an aside
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.760]   in this chapter, verse seven.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.920]   He actually steps back and he shows them
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.440]   what's happened during the journey.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.400]   He says, "Now Moses used to take a tent
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.600]   "and pitch it outside the camp some distance away,
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.960]   "calling it the tent of meeting.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.640]   "And then he, in inquiring of the Lord,
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.240]   "would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.820]   "And whenever Moses went out to the tent,
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.340]   "all the people rose and stood at the entrances of the tent
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.800]   "watching Moses until he entered into the tent.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.900]   "So Moses went into the tent.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.400]   "The pillar of cloud would come down
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.120]   "and stay at the entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.080]   "Whenever the people saw that the pillar of cloud
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.840]   "standing at the entrance to their tents,
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.600]   "they all stood and worshiped each
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.760]   "at the entrance to their tent.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.020]   "The Lord would speak to Moses face to face
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.160]   "as a man speaks to his friend."
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.680]   Isn't that beautiful, the intimacy of that relationship.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.700]   "Then Moses would return to the camp,
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.620]   "but his young aide Joshua, son of Nun,
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.120]   "did not leave the tent."
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.080]   Moses puts this in the story here in chapter 33
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.800]   as a bit of an aside to everything else
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.180]   that God is trying to say,
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.800]   'cause he's trying to remind his people,
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.760]   God has been with us.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.120]   God has always been with us.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.640]   Every single time we pitched that tent,
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.480]   he came and was present with us.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.280]   And you all came on the outside of the tents
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.560]   and you're worshiping him.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.120]   And you are now in danger of throwing all of that away
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.200]   simply because you're focused primarily
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.880]   on what he does for you rather than who he really is.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   You need to understand why this is so important for God here,
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.640]   why this question is so critical.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.480]   And to understand that,
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.160]   you actually have to go back a little bit further
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.560]   than the Exodus story itself.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.400]   You have to go all the way back
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.320]   to the original creation of the world in Genesis.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.920]   'Cause what you see in Genesis 1 and 2
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.960]   is this beautiful picture right at the end of it,
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.760]   where God creates humanity and makes humanity in his image.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.560]   And what picture do we get at the end of Genesis 2?
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.520]   It's the picture of God coming and communing
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.400]   with humanity in the garden,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.840]   his presence and humanity side by side.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.120]   And there are so many benefits of Eden.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.640]   There are so many things that are filled with blessings
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.920]   that are found in Eden.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.120]   But the most important reality
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.800]   of what we see at the end of Genesis 2
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   is that God has been created to be in communion with God.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.880]   It's really important that you see this
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.480]   right at the beginning of the biblical story,
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   that our whole being of what it means
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.960]   to be made in the image of God
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.080]   is to be brought into the presence of God.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.360]   And so at the end of Genesis 2,
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.240]   this is called shalom, it's called peace.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.640]   In other words, this is the way things should be.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.840]   We should be in this communion with God,
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.360]   his presence with us, our presence with him,
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.520]   living in such an intimacy with him.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.760]   It's like God is with us as a friend.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.280]   That's the way we have been created to be.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.640]   And ultimately our fullness of joy,
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.380]   our fullness of who we are is found in the presence of God.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.520]   That's Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.760]   Are you following that?
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.680]   Which is why in Genesis 3, something really bad happens.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.060]   See, when sin enters the picture in Genesis 3,
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.480]   the result of that at the end of that chapter
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.880]   is the exile of Adam and Eve from Eden.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.580]   It is the pushing out of Adam and Eve
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.500]   from the presence of God in the garden.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.560]   It's important that you track with this
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.400]   'cause we are being created
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.860]   to be in intimate relationship with God,
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.980]   but our sin banishes us into exile.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.000]   It pushes us out of the presence of God.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.840]   And when we're in exile,
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.500]   there's a longing that is inside of us.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.600]   See, you have to understand that Adam and Eve
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.160]   are separated from God's presence because of their sin.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.160]   And when that happens, it creates in all of us
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.880]   our greatest brokenness and our greatest longing.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.320]   See, we've been created for the presence of God,
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.320]   and it is only in his presence
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.420]   that that brokenness is healed.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:08.200]   So the biblical story is we're created for God's presence,
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.080]   but in our sin, we break the reality
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.200]   of that presence from us,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.600]   and it creates in us this brokenness
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.320]   and this longing inside of us.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.760]   And every human being in the world
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.560]   has this longing inside of them.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.960]   Whether they realize where it comes from or not,
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.440]   or whether they realize how to satisfy it or not,
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.840]   that longing is in inside all of us.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.040]   We don't want to be in exile from God's presence.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.240]   We long as a human race to be back
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.760]   into a place of peace and shalom again.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.280]   This is why Augustine,
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.040]   one of the greatest writers in church history,
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.080]   St. Augustine, he put it this way.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.760]   He said, "You have made us for yourself, O Lord,
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.760]   "and our hearts are restless
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.120]   "until they find their rest in you."
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.440]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.020]   You've made us for yourself, but we're restless.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.040]   There's this unsatisfiedness in us
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.840]   until we find that rest in you,
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.480]   until we find that relationship with you.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.160]   Until that's rebirthed and renewed,
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.600]   we find ourselves in a place of great brokenness
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.400]   and restlessness.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.440]   It's like I'm not fully the person that I'm supposed to be.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.880]   This is why in Psalm 42, the psalmist writes,
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.880]   "As a deer pants for water, so my soul longs after you."
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.360]   What the writer is saying is not this.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.000]   He's not trying to give you a picture
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.680]   of a nice deer in a lush meadow
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.600]   with an incredibly flowing stream,
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.560]   and the deer is lapping it up all happily.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.200]   He's giving you a picture of a deer
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.920]   who's in a desert, in exile, in wilderness,
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.960]   who is so parched and so thirsty
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.200]   that if he doesn't find water soon, he's going to die.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.160]   And he says that just as a deer would pant
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.120]   desperately for water,
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   so my soul is panting always for satisfaction.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.180]   And that can only be found, the psalmist says, in you.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:02.320]   This is why what we see happen in Exodus 33 is so key.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.600]   God puts a crossroads before his people,
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.240]   and he says, "Do you want me,
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.240]   "or do you want the things of me?"
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.040]   Because if you decide to remain with just the things of me,
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.380]   you are still in exile.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:22.080]   You're still outside of Eden.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.960]   And the longing of every human soul
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.080]   is how do we get back to being in the presence of God?
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.200]   That's what Exodus has been about.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.640]   The whole of the Exodus journey
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.240]   has not just been about what God can do
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.880]   to overcome slavery and oppression.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.200]   It has not just been about how God wants to step in
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.560]   and bring evil to its knees
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.640]   and show his sovereignty over creation.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.000]   The whole point of the Exodus story
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.420]   leads us to this very point.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.440]   The Exodus is the story of Eden restored.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.880]   It's the story of God stepping in and saying,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.200]   "I am now coming to you.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.200]   "Even in your brokenness and sin, my presence is here."
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.340]   God is changing the story.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.040]   And he's inviting his people to recognize
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.440]   that the story has changed,
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.000]   and they can now have the restoration
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.640]   of the very thing that they've longed for the most.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.600]   So I want you to track with this.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.160]   Is that all with you?
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.200]   Now when you get that background,
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.400]   you can understand why in Exodus chapter 32,
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.480]   God is so upset at their idolatry,
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.480]   and why in Exodus 33, he says,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.060]   "The promises haven't gone, but I will not go with you."
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.840]   Because there has to be a choice here.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.520]   You're either gonna choose me or the things of me.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.340]   That's your choice.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.800]   But everything I've done in this point
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.480]   is to bring myself to you
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.740]   because I have drawn you out in order to draw you in.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.960]   Now notice how Moses responds to this.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.380]   Verse 12, "Moses says to the Lord,
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.760]   "You have been telling me, lead these people,
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.280]   "but you have not let me know whom you will send with me."
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.520]   Now God's just said, "I'm gonna send an angel with you."
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.320]   But Moses goes, "I'm not satisfied with an angel."
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.960]   Anyone ever been not satisfied
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.880]   with who you've had to go through life with?
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.720]   Actually, don't answer that.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.560]   That's a bad question.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.260]   God's just said to Moses,
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.600]   "I'm gonna send an angel with you."
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.300]   And God says, "You asked me to lead these people,
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.260]   "but you haven't told me who's gonna go with me."
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.360]   In other words, I'm not happy with an angel.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.300]   "You have said, I know you by name,
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.600]   "and you have found favor with me.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.380]   "If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways."
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.820]   Another way to translate that, "Show me the way."
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.380]   In other words, I need you to go with me.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.220]   "Show me the way.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.060]   "I don't know how to do it.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.280]   "I can't lead these people.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.920]   "Some angel's not good enough for me.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.940]   "I only want you.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.300]   "You have drawn me out to draw me in.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.340]   "I am in with you.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.980]   "Please do not leave me," Moses is saying.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.060]   I wonder if some of us can get that in our hearts.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.940]   God, please don't leave us.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.460]   We recognize the idolatry that's so in us,
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.820]   and Lord, we know that that drives you away.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.980]   Lord, we don't wanna be in exile again.
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.620]   Notice how God replies in verse 14.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.400]   The Lord replied, "My presence will go with you,
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.040]   "and I will give you rest."
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.500]   Isn't that so beautiful?
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.100]   Now, I want you to see something here.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.860]   The idea of God giving them rest points them back to Eden,
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.480]   to that great place of Shalom where they had rest with God,
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.620]   but it also points them forward to the Promised Land,
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.780]   which was always promised to be a place of rest.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.940]   But I want you to see something even more important.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.780]   Notice the order God says here.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.440]   "My presence will go with you,
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.300]   "and then you will know my benefits."
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:37.100]   In other words, if you seek my benefits without my presence,
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.500]   you will ultimately be in idolatry,
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.060]   'cause you're in the idolatry of self.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.940]   And although those promises may not be removed,
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.980]   you're settling for the second best thing.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.620]   But if my presence goes with you,
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.100]   then out of my presence will flow
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.540]   all of the things you will ever need.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.100]   And the greatest thing you will ever need is rest.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:01.680]   With me, your soul that longs and pants
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.520]   after water like a deer will find its rest in me.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.500]   Notice how Moses responds.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.620]   "Moses said to him, 'If your presence does not go with us,
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.780]   "'do not send us from here.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.540]   "'For how will anyone know that you are pleased with us
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.020]   "'and with your people unless you go with us?
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.260]   "'What else distinguishes me and your people
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.980]   "'from all the other people on the face of the earth?'"
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.020]   Moses is doing amazing theology here.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.300]   He's saying, "We will not go anywhere without your presence,
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.500]   "because if you haven't restored Eden,
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.860]   "if your presence isn't with us,
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.020]   "then what message do we have to say to the world?
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.940]   "We're no different from the Egyptians
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.260]   "if we go to the promised land without your presence,
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.380]   "'cause it's your presence with us
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.180]   "that communicates to the world
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.600]   "that we are welcomed back into God's presence.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.820]   "It means that you're pleased with humanity again.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.740]   "It means that the sin and the brokenness
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.460]   "is being paid for and changed.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.460]   "You with us is a message for the world.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.380]   "You with us says that, hey, we have a God
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.740]   "who despite our brokenness wants to be with us.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.020]   "We have a God who wants to communicate to us as a friend.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.300]   "We have a God who is worthy to be worshiped.
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.060]   "And if we go without you, we've got nothing to say."
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:24.020]   It's like Moses is saying, "I am nothing without you.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.600]   "We can't do this.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.840]   "There's no point in doing this.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.220]   "We don't wanna be a theological social club.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.600]   "We need you."
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.540]   And I wonder whether that might be the cry
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.940]   of this generation in Hong Kong
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.740]   and the church in Hong Kong at this time.
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.740]   God, we refuse to do anything unless you're with us.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.680]   Because we have nothing to say to government.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.580]   We have nothing to say to society.
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.220]   We have nothing to say to our marriages,
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.960]   our businesses, our families,
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.980]   what it means to raise children.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.360]   We have nothing to say if it doesn't come through you.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.100]   Your presence, out of your presence,
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.380]   flows all the power to transform and change everything.
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.820]   We can't do it on our own.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.620]   There's no power in us, Moses is saying.
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.660]   So we will not go unless you go with us.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.920]   And I wonder whether some of us in this room
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.780]   might get that passion fired up in us.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:15.220]   We will not do this without you, Lord.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.580]   Basically, what we're saying is
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.140]   we're having a holy posture before a broken world,
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.660]   and we're saying we are nothing
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.660]   without the presence of Jesus.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.540]   There is nothing in this world
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.540]   that can satisfy other than him.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.340]   It is him, or it is nothing.
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.820]   Are you with me?
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.420]   Well, it's easy for us to say yes.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.220]   'Cause I wanna say yes to that too.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.660]   But if you really put that into practice in your life,
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.000]   it will change everything for you.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.020]   The sacrifice of the house saying,
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.980]   "Me and my house will serve the Lord,"
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.440]   is a deep, big call.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.500]   Not an easy one to make,
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.500]   and not one we should ever make lightly.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.260]   But it comes out of this place of saying,
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.520]   "The presence first.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.580]   "The presence first."
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.420]   It's amazing what the New Testament writers do.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.100]   The New Testament writers pull all of this together,
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.340]   and they begin to make the threads of God coming
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.220]   and being with his people
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.460]   and restoring the world in Jesus Christ.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.460]   You see, Exodus is just a foretaste
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.900]   of what's gonna happen in Jesus.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.000]   Exodus is just like a foretelling of a better story.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.660]   The better story, of course, is the gospel,
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.260]   the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.820]   This is why, in the New Testament,
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:26.900]   the writers look at Jesus,
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.660]   and they say, "He is Emmanuel, God with us,
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.540]   "the fullness of God now with us."
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.480]   Not God on a mountain, not God in some tent,
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.460]   not God even in a temple, not even God in a church,
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.600]   God with us fully,
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.560]   humanity and God together in the incarnation.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.600]   Emmanuel now, God with us.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.620]   This is why John, when he starts the gospel
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.440]   that he's writing, the story of Jesus,
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.600]   he says it this way.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.240]   He says, "God has now had the pleasure
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.320]   "of taking the word and making it flesh
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.920]   "and having it dwell with us."
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.120]   The word dwell there is the word tabernacle,
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.620]   which links back to the passages
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.040]   we're looking at in Exodus.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.480]   God has decided to come and tabernacle with us
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.960]   in his fullness.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.040]   This is why, when Jesus breathes out his last on the cross,
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.360]   the curtain in the temple is torn, too,
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.180]   to allow people to come into God's presence
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.000]   and allow God's presence to go out to them.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.600]   This is why Jesus stands in his resurrection
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.040]   before his disciples and says, "Don't leave Jerusalem
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.300]   "until you receive the helper that is to come,
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.940]   "that is gonna fill you and restore you
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.580]   "in the only way that that can happen,
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.900]   "the fullness of my presence with you."
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.060]   Which is why, in Acts chapter two,
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.700]   the disciples are sitting in that room
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.920]   celebrating Pentecost, by the way,
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.800]   Pentecost being the festival that celebrates
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.840]   the giving of the law at Mount Sinai.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.720]   They're celebrating that, and the Holy Spirit
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.040]   is poured out on them in such a big way
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.920]   because the Spirit is now being written
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.540]   on the flesh of their hearts.
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.240]   This is why Paul, when he writes to the church,
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.660]   says, "Hey, here's the thing.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.560]   "You are now the temple of the Holy Spirit
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.480]   "because he now lives fully in you."
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.240]   Our answer is not that we're drawn out of our slavery
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.760]   towards the mountain.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.400]   We are drawn out of our slavery to Jesus,
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.880]   and in that, Jesus puts his fullness in us.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.240]   You don't need a needon anymore.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.740]   You don't need some mountain with fire and an earthquake.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.960]   You don't need a tent or a temple.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.180]   You don't, as much as I love it, need the church.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.280]   You do, but anyway, that's a whole 'nother story.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.240]   But what you do need
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.520]   is the fullness of his presence in you,
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.960]   and that is available to anyone who confesses Jesus Christ
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.800]   as their Lord and Savior.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.040]   The Spirit is in us.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.640]   The same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.560]   is now in me.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.420]   Eden restored.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.260]   Are you with me?
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:44.480]   So he has drawn you out so that he could draw you in.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.600]   He's met you in the darkest place,
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.520]   and his light has shone in the darkest place,
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.720]   and it's shone into the darkest place
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.920]   to welcome you out of the darkness on a journey towards him,
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.000]   and when you find him, to find yourself settling on him,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.640]   not on his benefits, not on the things of him,
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.280]   but him himself.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   When we were in Egypt, we made a film for you,
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.080]   a film that could express and symbolize
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.560]   this incredible journey that God does in each one of us,
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.000]   and a film that we've created,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.360]   which I hope inspires you to come home.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.400]   Have a look at this.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.960]   (dramatic music)
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.480]   (wind blowing)

[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.840]   (wind blowing)
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.000]   (dramatic music)

[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.000]   (dramatic music)
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.600]   (wind blowing)
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:55.600]   - He's drawn you out to draw you in.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.400]   May his presence be what everything in you is about.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   Let me pray for you.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   Father, we come before you as a people,
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:12.600]   a long, long Lord.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   To live lives that represent what the Exodus is about.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.000]   Lives that are given to your presence.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.600]   Lives that live out of your presence.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:29.800]   Lives that are drawn into you
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   and that out of you are then sent into the world.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.400]   Father, I pray that your presence would be
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   on all of our lips.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.000]   Lord, it would be the thing that we would desire the most.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   The thing that would shape and form the vine
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.600]   to be the community that it is.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.800]   And Lord, just like last week,
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.000]   we take the idolatries that we know are in us
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.800]   that have the power to strip us of your presence.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:02.600]   And we thank you that in Jesus Christ, we have the answer.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.400]   We have Eden restored in its fullness.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.600]   That even in our brokenness, in our sin,
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.000]   we have one who is dead and we have one who is alive.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.800]   And one who has taken the price of that
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.200]   and has opened the way for us to be fully known.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.000]   And to be fully back in communion with you.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.400]   And Lord, I wanna pray now.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.000]   Maybe you'd be comfortable,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.400]   you just open your hands with me as I pray this.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.800]   Father, I wanna pray now
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.000]   for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.200]   over every single person here.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:41.400]   That Father, your spirit and your power and your presence
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.800]   be there everything, Lord.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.600]   I pray Lord for those in this room
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.400]   that have not felt your presence for a long time
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.600]   would know in this moment right here
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.000]   the fullness of your presence, come Holy Spirit.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.800]   Lord, I pray for those who feel like
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.000]   that dancer in a dark room right now.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.200]   Who can see the shards of light breaking in,
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.000]   but don't know what to do.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.400]   I pray Lord that they would feel your presence now,
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.600]   drawing them out of that darkness into you.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.400]   Lord, for those in this room
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   that are like the dancer on the desert,
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.800]   who have found freedom, but haven't found home yet.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.800]   Father, for those of us in this room
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.400]   where we put your blessings
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.200]   and the things of you above you yourself.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   Would you forgive us and help us to be home?
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.800]   And Lord for every single one of us,
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.000]   I pray that we would be like her,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.800]   quiet and attentive in your presence,
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.000]   receiving from you the fullness of life.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.800]   Come Holy Spirit, come.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.200]   I wanna invite you just to take a moment
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.800]   before we close our service, to just pray.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.200]   Our most classic form of connecting with God
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.200]   is through prayer.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.800]   (gentle music)
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.600]   So just take some time to pray for yourself
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.600]   and pray with yourself.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   Or you might even wanna pray with the people
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.200]   that are around you, if you feel comfortable to.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.400]   Maybe pray with your spouse or pray with your friends.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.200]   Just take some time just to acknowledge God's presence.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.000]   Confess the desire that you have
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.200]   for his presence in your life.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.000]   And invite more of that presence.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   And we'll do that in a place of worship.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.580]   (upbeat music)
