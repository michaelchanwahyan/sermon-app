[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   Well, it's so good to see you. Many people in the room I recognize, perhaps some new people here too,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.600]   so it's wonderful to have you with us. As Tim said, I'm Andrew, I'm the senior pastor here at The Vine,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.920]   both in Wanchai, and we bring our greetings to you from Wanchai. We pray for you guys every week. We
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.600]   always mention Yuen Long every single Sunday, so everybody there is like, "Oh, wow, great,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.320]   there's a fellowship in Yuen Long," and we try to encourage people to come and visit you guys,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.760]   so I'm sure you'll see a number of us coming through here every once in a while. During worship,
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.760]   before I start preaching, I wanted to share something out of worship. During worship,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.680]   I saw a picture for, I think, us as a community here in Yuen Long. It was a picture of a big
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.240]   padlock, you know, the sort of padlock that you might put on your luggage or something like that,
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.040]   a big, like, padlock, and I saw an old set of keys, a keychain, one of those big rings with
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.160]   rust on it, with all those big keys on it. There was about 20 or so keys on this big key ring,
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.240]   and I saw somebody desperately trying to unlock this padlock using these keys that were on this
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.480]   key ring, and they were going through them one by one, getting more desperate and more desperate
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.640]   because they couldn't seem to open the lock, and I felt like God's saying, as this person's anxiety
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.040]   was increasing, I felt like God's saying, "You need to understand that this lock only opens
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.560]   with my keys, not yours," and this person was desperately trying to use the keys that they had
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.000]   to try to bring a breakthrough in opening this lock, and God was saying, "You have to give that
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.480]   to me because there's no key. There's no key in your key ring that is going to unlock that for
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.120]   you in your life. That's only something that I can do," and my prayer for us as we go through this
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.400]   Word together today and as we spend time just praying and ministering to one another is that
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.880]   that'll become a reality for you. Maybe something I'll be sharing today, maybe something out of the
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.720]   Scripture, maybe a prayer that someone's going to pray after today, maybe a conversation for coffee
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.600]   when we finish the service. I don't know when it will happen, but I do think that God will break
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.560]   in for some of you here today where you feel a bit locked, a bit like cramped down, not able to
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.200]   break through. You've been trying everything you can do to get there. Someone's going to say
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.960]   something. Someone's going to pray something. A Scripture's going to come, and it's going to be
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.320]   like, "Oh my gosh, that's suddenly open to me," and so I want to pray that over us as a community
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.720]   before we start. Lord, I just thank you so much for every person here, and I believe that, Lord,
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.920]   you are bringing breakthrough today, and Lord, there are areas of our lives that are locked.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.000]   I know there's areas of my life that are locked that I desperately at times want to break through
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.800]   in, and I've tried so hard, and it doesn't seem to have worked, so I know this word's for me too.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.280]   Lord, for anyone else here who resonates with what I'm talking about, I want to pray,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:59.120]   Lord, that your key would come through the power of your Spirit, for the same Spirit that raised
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.320]   Christ from the grave lives also in you, and Lord, I pray that that Spirit would unlock some things
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.640]   over people in this room today, and we pray this in Jesus' name. Everyone says. So once I met a
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.200]   murderer. I was in a maximum security prison in the Philippines. It was a woman's prison.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.720]   I was there as part of a missions team from the Vine Church, and we'd gone to this particular
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.080]   prison to share the gospel with people that were there, and we were assigned people by random,
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.080]   and I was assigned this lady randomly, and I sat down, and there was the glass, and she sat
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.680]   on the other side of the glass. We had to pick up the telephone to talk to each other. It was just
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.760]   like the movies, but unlike the movies, as I start talking to her, the first thing she tells me,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.640]   she says, "I'm in life for prison. Sorry, I'm in prison for life. I'm never going to get out of
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.040]   here. I'm in prison for life," she said, "because I murdered someone," and I had never heard that
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.680]   before. I had never seen a murderer before. Maybe I'd had, and I didn't know they were a murderer,
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.680]   but this is the first time someone had admitted to me that they were a murderer,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.160]   and it changed everything, and I was so uncomfortable in that moment. Immediately,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.600]   here's what was going through my mind. I wonder who it was that they killed. Was it their husband?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.120]   Was it their parents? Was it a random person? I was beginning to think, "Are they an assassin?
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.720]   Were they hired to kill someone?" I then began to think, "How did they kill this person? Did they
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.600]   use a weapon? Was it their bare hands? How did they actually commit this crime?" Although I'm
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.080]   trying to talk to her, I'm thinking to myself, "I actually don't like this person," and I begin
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.680]   to judge them simply because of the fact that they were a murderer. I'm honest to God. Here's what
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.880]   this is before I was a pastor, by the way. I just want to say that, but honest to God,
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.520]   here's what went through my mind. It was this. I don't know if she deserves the gospel
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.360]   because I don't know if she's actually repentant of her crime.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.480]   I mean, she took someone's life, and I don't know if she's worth the gospel.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:18.000]   About a year and a half later, I met a U.S. dollar billionaire. U.S. dollar billionaire.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.360]   This person was the number two in one of the most famous tech businesses in China. If I told you the
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.400]   name of this company, you would know the company. I sat next to him at this dinner, a lowly pastor
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.080]   sitting next to a U.S. dollar billionaire. I'm like, "What do I have to talk to this man about?"
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.600]   But everything about this man attracted me. I thought he was the most awesome person. I mean,
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.000]   so successful, so wealthy. I remember looking at his watch. I'm a bit passionate about watches. I
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.080]   remember glancing at his watch, staring at his watch, going, "That watch could cover my family
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:59.040]   for all of our lives." That's how nice that watch is. His suit was perfect. He had this perfect suit.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.360]   As we were talking over the dinner, I found myself having a bit of a man crush on this guy.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.360]   I wanted to be like him. He was the coolest, the nicest, the most successful and powerful man.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.600]   I actually sat there talking with him, thinking this. If he opened his wallet right now and gave
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.160]   me some money, just like the chump change that's in his wallet, it would probably be like a million
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.960]   Hong Kong dollars. Surely a U.S. dollar billionaire has a million Hong Kong dollars just lying around
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.920]   that they would love. I was completely seduced by this man's power. I thought to myself, "This
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:42.080]   is who I want to be, a murderer and a U.S. dollar billionaire, two people with very different
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:50.400]   backgrounds that I had a very different reaction to." I would like to stand here today and tell
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:58.640]   you that I treated both equally through the blood of Jesus, but I did not. One, I immediately judged
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.120]   because of the failures of their past. The other, I immediately accepted because of the apparent
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:12.240]   success of their present. It's interesting, isn't it? Fascinating how we humans judge based on
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.880]   appearance, judge based on our understanding of someone, judge perhaps based on someone's
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:25.440]   background or how we perceive them. That causes us to make assumptions and judgments, which we
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.880]   almost on a daily basis, sometimes consciously, sometimes subconsciously, that we make of people
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.400]   all the time. If you were to be in my position right now and stand on this stage and look at
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.120]   all of you right now, you would also be making judgments of everybody in this room. I'm judging
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.000]   you. No, I'm not judging you right now. But we so easily do this as human beings.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.160]   And the Apostle Paul, as he's writing this letter to the churches in Galatia,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.800]   this is the pressure that he's under. He's being judged. He's being judged, as Pastor Tim explained
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.720]   last week in our kickoff to this series, by these distractors who are now trying to say in the
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.600]   churches of Galatia that Paul is a false prophet, that he's not a true apostle. And they're trying
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.840]   to discredit his ministry, trying to pull down his authority. And they're doing that by sort of
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:20.160]   saying, look, he only gave you half the gospel. This idea of coming to faith in Christ by just
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.640]   grace alone. Sure, that's part of it. But you also need to become more Jewish. You Gentiles need to
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:33.360]   adhere to the Jewish festivals. You need to adhere to the Sabbath every week. And if you're male here,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.400]   you need to be circumcised. And Paul, he didn't tell you the whole picture because he was people
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.520]   pleasing. He wanted you to tickle your ears and just make you feel good. But actually, the true
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.040]   gospel, the whole gospel is this. And they're sowing division within the church because they're
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:55.280]   making a judgment on Paul. They're judging Paul for two very important reasons. First of all,
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.040]   they believe that he does not have the credentials that the other apostles and disciples had.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.480]   They know that he wasn't with Jesus, that he didn't minister with him for a couple of years and
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.120]   see them at his death and meet him in his resurrection. They know that Paul was not
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.120]   there like Peter was, like James was, like John was. He didn't have the credentials.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.000]   The other thing they were judging him from, and this is a very important thing, because of his
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.160]   past, because of his background, if you will, because of his resume. See, they knew that Paul
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:36.320]   had actually crushed the church, had persecuted the church. They knew that Paul had been a murderer
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.800]   himself in the sense of being there, adhering to this stoning of Stephen. They knew that this all
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.840]   rolled back up to Paul. And they looked at that and they said, "This man needs to have a background
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.400]   that's worthy of the gospel. He needs to have a background that proves the goodness of God.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.640]   Look at his background. His background does not add up." And they judged him because of his past.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:07.440]   In their eyes, Paul was the murderer in prison. They were the U.S. dollar billionaires.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:16.000]   Resumes are fascinating things, aren't they? Every single one of us has one. And unfortunately,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.040]   with the world that we live in today, we all need them. My first job out of university was
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.720]   a recruitment consultant. You could argue that I'm an expert on resumes. I spent the first three
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:36.160]   years of my working life poring over every person who's sent in an application to work with us as a
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.920]   recruitment consultant. I looked at their resumes. I was an expert at taking someone's resume and
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.400]   saying, "Okay, you're applying for this finance job over here. Let me take your background and let
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.560]   me massage it and manipulate it. You need to put this line first. You need to put that job down
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.760]   here. You need to emphasize what you did here. You need to actually not emphasize that. Nobody
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.680]   wants to hear about that. But for this job, this is the thing you need." And I was an expert at
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.400]   taking someone's background and making them sound so much better than they actually were.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.280]   I was really good at actually helping people to get the jobs that they wanted because that's the
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.760]   way the world works. You get a job because you've got the right kind of experience, the right kind
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.240]   of background, because you've got the right kind of skill sets. And we're so ingrained to thinking
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.800]   that that's the way the world works that we so often think that that's the way the church should
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.480]   work. That's the way the kingdom should work. When we have to actually realize that God operates in
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.280]   a very different way to that. You need to understand this right up front. God has a very
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:37.440]   different perception about who he sees as worthy within his kingdom. You need to know that God does
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:45.600]   not look at the same kind of resumes that we look at. In fact, the only resume that God has ever
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:53.680]   needed is his son, Jesus Christ. When God is choosing people to use in his kingdom,
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.120]   he doesn't look at their resume. He looks at Jesus' resume. And because of what Jesus has
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.920]   accomplished in his life, in his death, in his resurrection, because Jesus has paid that price
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:10.320]   for sin and broken through, because Jesus has sent the Holy Spirit to people and made them righteous
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:15.200]   because of the work of the cross. God, when he's choosing people to work with in the kingdom,
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.640]   he looks through the resume, the background, the blood of Christ Jesus. And he says that you are
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.360]   worthy, not because of your background, not because of your skill set, not because of some certain
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:31.440]   thing. You are only worthy because Jesus has made you worthy on the cross. And his resurrection
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:38.560]   provides now the place for you to flourish. God is not the great HR manager in the sky
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.520]   looking at your background and seeing whether you add up.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:52.480]   God, his arms are open to all of us. And I think there are some of you in this room here today
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:59.040]   where you're embarrassed about your background, where there have been some things that have
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.320]   happened in your life, some things that have taken place, maybe in some recent history,
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.520]   or maybe in some further away history. And you're ashamed, you're embarrassed.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:16.640]   And because of that, your life in Christ, I would say, has the handbrake on. Do you know what I mean
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.120]   by that? Like if you're in a car trying to drive and the handbrake's on. I feel like some of you
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.520]   in this room, your life in Christ, it's like the handbrake is on because you've not been able to
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.040]   let go of some of that brokenness in your past. And I hope that what I share today might set some
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.320]   of you free from what I think is one of the enemy's greatest strategies over the church,
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   and that is to make you feel like because of something you've done before that you are no
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:48.400]   longer worthy. But actually, God wants to turn that completely upside down. You see,
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:56.400]   true freedom in Christ is found knowing that we approach God with Jesus's resume and not our own.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.680]   That's where true freedom is found. And because that's where true freedom is found,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.320]   is we really understand that. Not just understand it here, but truly understand it here.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:12.880]   We're able to become the people that Christ has called us to be. And Paul, as he's about to start
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.320]   the defense of his gospel and the defense of his ministry from halfway through chapter one for the
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.800]   rest of the letter, he's going to defend it all. He starts what we're looking at with today. He's
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:29.520]   going to start by helping his church to understand that they need to rethink the idea of their
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.560]   resume. I want to show you this because it's really beautiful what Paul does here. He says in
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.840]   Galatians 1, starting in verse 11, he says, "I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.200]   I preach to you is not something that I made up. I did not receive it from any person, nor was I
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:51.760]   taught it. Rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. For you've heard of my previous way
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.960]   of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. I was
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.240]   advancing in Judaism beyond many of the Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:10.000]   traditions of my father. But when God, who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.120]   was pleased to reveal his son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles,
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.640]   I did not consult any person, nor did I go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:27.680]   I was. But I went immediately to Arabia and later returned to Damascus." Father, as we open up this
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:34.000]   passage here together this morning, I want to pray that you would open us, Lord. You would set free
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.360]   those of us that feel like the handbrake is on. Lord, I pray that that would be for your glory.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:45.280]   And we pray this in Jesus' name, everyone says. It's really beautiful how Paul starts this. I want
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.960]   you to see how he starts his defense of his ministry. He says, "The first thing you need
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.560]   to understand is that this ministry didn't come to me because I sat in some seminar for like six
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.600]   weeks. It didn't come to me because I went to some seminary school or I even sat with the disciples
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:06.320]   for years and years and years. No, this came only from revelation of Jesus Christ. Jesus himself,
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:13.040]   he says, revealed the gospel to me." Now, the emphasis that he's putting on revelation here
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.960]   literally means it is a personal thing. I have fully understood it. It's not something, again,
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:23.280]   that I've got secondhand from someone. It's only come from Christ. And he wants the church to
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:29.680]   understand that this is a revelation, which means he did not earn it. It's like the first thing he's
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:35.840]   saying to his church is, "This is not because I'm some good person. This is not because I'm like what
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:42.240]   the distractors are trying to say the gospel person should be like, perfect and holy and wonderful."
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.600]   He's like, "I didn't get the gospel because I earned it, because I proved to God that I was
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:54.560]   worthy of it. It came by revelation from him. It didn't come because I had done something right.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.680]   It literally just came as like a download from him." And the reason why that's important is
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.680]   because he's talking about the source of that revelation. He's like, "It came from Jesus.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.960]   It didn't come from Peter, James, John," as important as they are. "This actually came from
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.720]   Jesus himself. He spoke to me directly and he gave me the gospel. And because I know that it's from
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:20.480]   Christ," he says, "this has not just transformed me, but the gospel that I bring you is directly
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.280]   from the source. It's not being filtered in any other way like the distractors were trying to
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:31.040]   argue to the churches." He's saying, "No, this came from Jesus. So it's pure, it's direct. And
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.800]   what I give to you, I pass on to you because he has given to me." Tim actually read that from our
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.000]   passage in Corinthians, didn't he? "What I received from Christ, I now pass on to you." When he was
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.960]   doing the Lord's Supper, he's saying the same thing here. "What I received from Christ, I'm now
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:54.880]   passing on to you, you people in the churches of Galatia." And he says this really interesting
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.040]   thing because what he's doing here is he's talking about his conversion. He's talking about that
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:05.280]   moment where he met Jesus on the road to Damascus. You can read this later in Acts chapter 9, in Luke's
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:11.920]   description of that moment. You can read it in Paul's own words in Acts 22 and Acts 26. But we
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:17.520]   kind of know the story. He's walking on the road to Damascus, going to kill and persecute Christians
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:24.400]   there. And Jesus appears to him, revelatorily appears to him, literally in a blinding light
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.960]   that so blinds Paul. And Jesus says, "Why are you persecuting me? Why are you attacking my church?"
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.120]   And he's like, "Who are you, Lord?" And he's like, "The one that you are persecuting. I am the Christ."
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:42.320]   And Paul has this incredible transformative moment then. And it's so radically transformed. He's
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.800]   actually blinded by the light. It's only a few days later when another disciple, an Ananias, comes and
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.640]   prays for him. Scales fall from his eyes and he's able to see again. And this is like a metaphor for
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:58.880]   Paul about how he was blind before in his Jewish understanding and now could see the truth as it
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.240]   was. That's the revelation he's speaking about here. I have received this revelation that's come
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.280]   from Christ and it happened dramatically in that moment. In fact, in the passage here, he actually
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:15.120]   describes a little bit of this moment. He says from verse 13, "For you have heard of my previous
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.800]   way of life in Judaism, how I intensely persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. I was
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.280]   advancing in Judaism beyond many of the Jews of my own age, and I was extremely zealous for the
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:32.160]   traditions of my fathers." Notice this. This is the exact background that the distractors were
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:38.800]   using to argue that Paul was not worthy of the gospel. They're saying, "Hey, because of what he
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:44.320]   did to the church before, how could you ever trust this guy?" And you would think that if Paul was
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.560]   smart, he would then shove that to the side and pretend like maybe that never happened. Maybe he
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.840]   had never bring that up. "I can't tell my church about my background and my history. That would be
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:57.520]   really bad." He doesn't do it. He doesn't respond that way. In fact, he does the opposite of what
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:03.120]   his distractors were thinking he was going to do. He puts it up there plain for them to read.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.520]   He says, "You know, here's my background. Yes, I persecuted Christians. Yes, I tried to bring down
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.560]   the church. Yes, I was zealous for the faith before. Everything they told you about me,
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:20.400]   a hundred percent true." And the question we should be asking ourselves is, "Why is Paul doing this?
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.360]   Why isn't he burying and hiding his past?" Because if we're honest with ourselves, that's what we do,
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.160]   isn't it? I mean, when we've screwed up in the past and we've done stuff that we're not proud of,
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.480]   we kind of just don't want to talk about that stuff anymore. We just kind of pretend like that
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.520]   never happened. And we put on a front before people that shows anything other than the truth
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.160]   of what may have happened. Paul doesn't go and play those games. He says, "You want to know about
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.880]   me? This is me." And the reason why he's doing that is because the distractors were arguing,
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:57.840]   "Because this is Paul, he's not worthy." Paul flips it around and he says, "Because this is me,
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:06.240]   I am worthy." He's saying, "My brokenness and my background, oh, I am the worst of all people.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:12.880]   My background actually doesn't discount the gospel, it shines the gospel." Because if I can
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.000]   now stand before you, Paul is saying, and preach the gospel, having had that background, surely
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.800]   that shows you the power that there is in the gospel. He says, "I'm not going to bury my past.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.640]   I'm not going to pretend like it never happened. I'm going to put it on display before you so you
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:32.640]   can see not anything about me, but you can see how God can come and transform people." Paul
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:39.360]   understood this, that Jesus can take the worst of all people, the worst of all sinners, and so
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.200]   transform them that they can become a living testimony of the grace and the forgiveness of
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:52.800]   a God who loves. Come on, church. This is his heart. This is his passion. He's like, "I'm not
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.360]   going to be embarrassed about that background. Sure, God wasn't proud of the fact that I was
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.480]   persecuting his church." He's like, "God wasn't happy with me." He's not trying to sort of pretend
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.840]   like that didn't have an impact. He's not trying to pretend like that wasn't sinful, but he's putting
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:13.920]   it up there to say, "Look at how sinful I was, and yet there's transformation that is found in the
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:21.360]   gospel. And if I can now stand before you and be of any hope to you today, it's because God has done
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:29.040]   it all." It's a beautiful thing. It's a powerful thought that actually the darkest parts of our
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.240]   journeys become the place where the power of the gospel is seen the most, and that should set some
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:45.920]   of you here free. Because sometimes that brokenness we want to bury, when actually that brokenness
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:53.120]   reveals the gospel more than anything else. Not that we revel in our brokenness, but that we
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:23:00.720]   recognize how far we've come. Oh man, if Jesus was not in my life, I can't even tell you what I might
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:08.160]   be like. He uses these words here as he goes on. So he's just said basically, "Here's all the bad
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.920]   stuff I've done, but I want you to understand it because it reveals the power of the gospel."
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:18.720]   Then he says this, verse 15, "But when God, who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace,"
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:26.880]   notice how he starts here, he says, "But when God," this is the crux and the heart of every testimony.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.160]   He says, "Here's all the stuff that I've done. Here's all the background. Here's all the
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   brokenness. Here's the persecution of the church. Here's all the zealousness I've had to the Jewish
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:40.880]   faith. But when God stepped in, when God met me on that road to Damascus, when he revealed his light
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.200]   and his glory to me, my whole life changed at that moment." And he wants to draw his church to focus
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   on these words, "But when God," which really is this example of him saying, "This is what God does.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.120]   When God steps in, he can take people who have got such broken backgrounds and reveal his love
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.840]   and his grace to them and so transform them that they then become these living examples of what
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.960]   that grace is all about in the world. But when God stepped in are perhaps the three greatest words
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:19.360]   that they're found in scripture. But when God," because Paul's convinced that God is able to save
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:26.960]   sinners and make enemies his children. That's what God does. He saves sinners and he makes enemies
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:35.360]   his children. That's the love of God. And Paul wants his church to understand that his qualification
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.400]   to preach the gospel is not because he's lived some perfect life. His qualification to preach
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:46.320]   the gospel is because he's lived such a bad life, but God didn't leave him in that place. But when
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:52.720]   God stepped in, everything changed. And these words, "But when God," becomes the centerpiece
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.120]   of what biblical redemptive history is all about. You just need to look at the pages of the Bible
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:03.600]   to see story after story of men and women who had broken and hurting and bad past. But when God
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:09.120]   stepped in, everything changed at that point. I mean, if Moses was standing here right now,
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:15.040]   he would say this to you. He'd say, "I was walking in a desert, feeling so distraught about my
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:21.120]   confused identity. I didn't know if I was a Jewish man or whether I was a prince of Egypt. And I was
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:28.720]   so confused about who I was that I was lost and wandering for years. But when God met me in a
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:35.200]   burning bush, he began to speak to me about who I truly am and my whole life changed." Isaiah,
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.440]   if he was standing here right now, he would say something like this to you. He would say, "I
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:45.600]   thought I could do nothing. I just thought I was a farmer, that I had nothing to offer in this world.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:52.400]   But when God gave me a vision, and in that vision, I saw coals burning on a fire and some tongues
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.840]   that came and took the coal and touched my lips, I knew that I was holy, not because of anything I
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:03.920]   had done, but because I'd been made holy by him. And then I could speak." If Peter was standing
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:10.080]   here right now, he would say, "I'm ashamed because I walked with him as one of his best friends.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.480]   And I thought I knew everything about him, and I thought I would always love him. But when he
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   got arrested, I denied him three times. And I was so ashamed by what I had done that I retreated
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:28.400]   back to my old life as a fisherman. But when God, who sent Jesus to me again, and we had breakfast
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:35.520]   on the beach, and he told me that he loved me, everything changed in that moment. But when God."
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:42.480]   And so I can stand here before you and tell you that I was a lost teenager who was wrapped up here
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:48.080]   in Hong Kong in an expat lifestyle, provided by my father who worked in a really wealthy bank,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.120]   and my father who had a great job, and us who had a lovely lifestyle. And I had become so dependent
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.440]   on it, and to be honest with you, so proud about it, that I felt like I didn't need anything else
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:04.000]   in my life other than my father's checkbook. But when God spoke to my father and told him to give
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.080]   up his high-paid job and go and work in a local orphanage for no money at all, and we lost our
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.520]   really nice house, and we were living now in a 200-square-foot apartment with 100 orphans,
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.760]   God broke into the pride and began to speak to me of another way that we could live. But
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:28.880]   when God. What is your "but when God" moment? For your "but when God" moment will become the
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.680]   very thing where you will see the power of the gospel revealed in your story. That's where it
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:39.360]   happens. Every single one of us has it. Every single one of us has one of those moments, and
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.360]   Paul is willing to stand before his church and say, "Here's all the stuff that happened. Here's
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.120]   all the stuff that, to be honest with you, I'm not super proud about, but it's the reality of my story.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   But here's what I want you to know. God stepped in, and when God stepped in, that's the power of the
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.640]   gospel. That's the story that really matters. That's the pivot point of all of history." And
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:06.560]   Paul's saying, "That's your story, too. That's your journey as well." And I love it because he
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.920]   carries on. See what he does next. He says, "But when God," and then he says this, "who set me apart
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:19.040]   from birth," I love this one. Let me preach on this for a moment. "Set me apart from birth." He doesn't
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:27.600]   say, "But when God decided to love me on the Damascus road." He doesn't say that the moment
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.840]   when God decided to break into his life happened on that road to Damascus. Paul's not saying, "The
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.160]   reason why God changed my life is because he knew where I was going into the city of Damascus, and
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.760]   he didn't want any of that to happen. So he decided this was the right moment to change everything."
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.840]   No, he says, "You want to know when Jesus, when God decided to change my life, it happened when I was
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:55.440]   born, because he decided at the moment of my birth to set me apart," he says. That word he uses in the
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.640]   Greek is the same word that's used for holiness, this idea of being set apart in Christ, being
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.080]   holy before him. It's amazing to me that Paul is not saying to the church, "God hated me, hated me,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.160]   hated me, hated me, hated me, hated me, hated me, and then he decided to come into my life and change
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.920]   my life." He says, "God came into my life and changed my life, but he loved me from the start.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:23.120]   He chose me from the start. He set me aside from birth." And for Paul, that was really important,
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.800]   because he understood that all the stuff that he had done in between, all that stuff was really bad,
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:34.560]   but it wasn't that God sort of suddenly decided to make a thing of his life. God had set him aside
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.000]   from the very beginning. Some of you in this room, that's going to set you free today,
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.560]   because perhaps you're thinking, "Man, man, God only decided to love me last year when I got
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:50.240]   baptized," or, "I didn't know anything about God, and then I came to knowledge of God, and I'm so
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:56.880]   glad that God chose me three years ago." I want to say a biblical truth over you. You, if you're a
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:05.200]   Christian in this room, were set apart from birth, that God saw you and knew you and desired for you
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:11.440]   to be in his kingdom, and he set you aside, that holiness idea from birth. That doesn't mean that
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.640]   everything we've done in our lives has always been holy. It doesn't mean that everything we've done
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.120]   in our lives has been pleasing to God. Absolutely not. There's a lot of stuff in Paul's background
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:25.440]   that wasn't pleasing to God, but he understood that God chose him in love from the start.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.880]   And some of you in this room, that should set you free, just that thought
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.920]   that he chose you from the beginning, that nothing, therefore, in your life is wasted.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:45.280]   No matter how hard it's been, how painful it's been, how sinful it's been, how broken it's been,
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.400]   none of it is wasted. Paul's basically saying this. By saying, "He chose me from birth," what
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.560]   he's saying is, "Nothing that happened, none of the persecution of Christians, none of the stuff
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.720]   that I did against the church, none of that disqualifies me from what I'm doing today,
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.560]   none of that knocked me off the path of his love, because he decided right at the start to love me
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:12.480]   before I did anything." This reminds you of that moment of Jesus' baptism, where God shows up and
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:18.400]   says, "This is my son, whom I love. With him, I am well pleased." Before Jesus does anything,
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.840]   no teaching, hadn't done any teaching, hadn't done any miracles, was not known by anyone at
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:29.760]   this point. Before Jesus did anything, God shows up and says right at the start, "You are loved."
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:36.960]   And Paul says, "Isn't it a wonderful thought for us as Christians that we were set aside from birth
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:42.560]   and that nothing that has ever happened in the middle has ever disqualified us from the wonder
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:49.520]   that is there in him?" Some of you in this room, you really struggle with this. And as a pastor,
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.600]   I spend a lot of my time with people, with Christians, who basically say, "Oh, pastor,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:01.680]   I know God loves me, and I know he saved me, but I know that I'm on plan B for my life now. I'm on
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.560]   plan C or plan D or plan E, because if you had known what I was like beforehand, man, there's
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:11.040]   no way that God can use me like he uses other people in the church. There's no way he can use
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.920]   me like he uses other people out there. I mean, those people are special people. They're the ones
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.840]   that have never sinned. They're the ones that have lived a perfect life. They're the ones that have
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.160]   had life just wonderfully. And of course, they're gifted. Of course, they're anointed. Of course,
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.160]   they have authority. But if you understood my background, you would understand that I just
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.840]   need to be quiet. You need to understand that I know that my life is not really going to amount
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.320]   to anything. I'm grateful that he loves me, that he saved me, but basically, I'm on plan D, E.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:43.600]   I want to stand before you today and say that is a lie from the enemy. Every single one of you,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:49.760]   if you believe that Jesus is your Lord and Savior, you have been set free from whatever past and
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:55.280]   whatever sin and whatever brokenness that has happened in the past. You were chosen from birth
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:02.320]   and God came into your life at whatever time that was, but when God and stepped into your life,
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:07.120]   but nothing ever knocked you off course. And while of course, there was pain and hurt and
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   brokenness and consequences to that sin in that part of your life, it has not disqualified you
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:19.520]   from authority, from anointing, or from the calling of the gospel. It has not taken it from
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.480]   you. And I think one of the lies of the enemy that is one of the strongest in the church today
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:30.160]   is Christians with the handbrake on because they think their sin in their past is holding them back
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:37.200]   from the authority, anointing, and calling of God. Your authority, your anointing, and your call from
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:45.440]   God has been given to you from birth and nothing Satan has ever done over you, ever has removed it
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:55.600]   from you, never has removed it from you. Is everybody okay? This should fill your heart
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:02.400]   with worship. I mean, this should fill you with such gratitude and such joy. Paul puts it this
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:08.160]   way as he's trying to kind of express his joy. He says, "Now, but when God who set me apart from
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:16.000]   birth and called me by his grace was pleased to reveal his son in me." Was pleased to reveal
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.600]   his son in me. Isn't that a beautiful thing? He said, "He was pleased. I didn't twist his arm.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.480]   I didn't have to try to clean up my life and get myself perfect again before he was pleased.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:32.320]   I didn't have to prove myself to him. Even in that moment of heading towards persecuting the church,
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:39.760]   he was pleased to reveal revelation, his gospel in me, in me, in the brokenness, in the darkness,
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:45.680]   in the sin, in the persecution. He was willing to reveal himself in me so that I might show
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:51.440]   the power of the gospel that transforms even the darkest of sinners like me." He says, "You want
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:58.720]   to know what my resume is? That's my resume," he says to the church. "My resume is not one that
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.880]   anybody would be proud of, but it reveals the power of the gospel. And if he's done it for me,
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:14.800]   he can also do it for you." So some of you here, some of you here, the challenge in this passage
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:23.520]   is to think about others. Because some of you here, you judge too easily the other around you.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.200]   And like I said at the start of my talk, man, we all do that, don't we? But some of you have
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.160]   found it easy for you to judge the people around you, maybe judge even the people in this church
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:42.880]   community. You've made judgments about their authority, their anointing, about their abilities
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:48.240]   in Christ, simply because of a rumor you've heard about them or something you've thought about them,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.480]   or maybe something you've seen and you've judged just because of the appearance of things.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.400]   We don't have time to look at it now, but Paul just later in chapter 2, he actually says,
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.760]   "We don't judge by the external appearance of things." God does not judge that way,
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.480]   but we so often judge that way. And some of you here today, that's what God's calling you to deal
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.160]   with today. He's going to invite you to a place of repenting before Him from the way that you so
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.840]   easily judge your brothers and your sisters and the people around your life. But I think for many
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:21.760]   of us, it's this thing. It's not just how you're thinking of others, it's actually how you're
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:28.240]   thinking about yourself. And there's a lot of us in this room where we have not released ourselves
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.600]   to the work of the kingdom in the way that we truly should do, because we place that handbrake
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.480]   on, because we're still punishing ourselves from our mistakes in the past, thinking that God is
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:46.320]   holding that over us when God has set you free. And because you are set free, you can receive the
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.880]   fullness of His ministry, the fullness of His authority, the fullness of His calling. It is
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.520]   for you. I wish I could meet that lady in the prison again. And I wish I could pick up that
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:01.440]   phone and sit, stare at her through that glass and not have that judgmental attitude I had before
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:08.720]   because of her background, but actually go, "You are worthy. You're worthy of the gospel.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.880]   And you're worthy of the gospel. I'm worthy of the gospel. All of us are worthy of the gospel."
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:20.560]   And if only we could release ourselves to be the fullness of what Christ has created us to be,
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.840]   and to cheer each other on in a place that doesn't judge, but in a place that says, "Because
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.600]   Christ has died and raised again, no matter what it is, you have been set aside from birth.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:39.840]   God has changed your life. Let's now go." Isn't that a beautiful thing? That's what Paul wants.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.440]   And I want to pray that over you here today. I wonder whether you would stand with me as we
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:50.000]   come to a time of prayer. And maybe as we stand, we can just quieten our hearts now
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.880]   and just allow the Holy Spirit just to minister to you
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:01.760]   right where the Holy Spirit needs to minister to you today.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.640]   Perhaps it's that picture of the lock and the keys,
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:16.000]   and Jesus is inviting you to let go of your strategies and your abilities, the things
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.800]   of your resume, and allow Him to step in and do what only He can do.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:28.560]   Perhaps for some of you, it's this area of judging others, just like I did with that woman that time.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.880]   Maybe you find yourself judging your colleagues, your family members,
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:40.720]   even people in this church community. The Lord wants to set you free from a judgmental attitude
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:48.960]   so that you can receive peace. Because when we judge others, it is a place of anxiety and stress.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:56.160]   It is a place of comparison and bitterness. And our judgment of others causes that to be in our
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.320]   hearts, and the Lord wants to set you free from that today. He wants to give you peace.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:09.600]   But I think for many of us, it's this area of truly being set free of the way that we see ourselves.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:14.640]   You are not disqualified. You are not on plan B.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:23.680]   And Paul has to stand before his church and say, "God chose me from birth. Sure, I did some bad
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:29.360]   things, but when God stepped in, everything changed." And that's the power of the gospel,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:35.840]   and some of you need to receive that personally today. That you were called and loved from birth,
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.840]   and sure, you've done some things over your life, and you've made some choices,
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.320]   and you've messed up, and there's been sin. And perhaps for some of us, there's still
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:49.920]   ripe sin that's happening right now. But when God stepped in and revealed the gospel to you,
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:40:00.080]   everything changed in that moment. And you are not on plan B. You are still in the authority,
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:07.040]   and the anointing, and the calling of God. The gospel is true in you, and the power of the
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:14.640]   gospel has been seen by the transformation that has happened within you. For the Lord was pleased
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:23.360]   to reveal himself to you. He wasn't angry, upset, or held back. He was so pleased to transform your
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:28.160]   life with the gospel. And I believe that the Holy Spirit wants to set some of you free from
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:33.840]   the condemnation that you've been placing upon yourself, so that you can walk into the freedom
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:39.520]   that comes in knowing that Christ has forgiven and set you free. Lord, I would just pray for anyone
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.240]   here, and if that's for you here this morning, just whilst our eyes are closed, I just want
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.000]   to invite you to open your hand before you. By opening your hands before you, it's just something
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.520]   we do here at the Vine that shows a submissive heart and attitude towards the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.040]   By opening our hands, it's our way of saying, "Lord, would you come?
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.720]   And I want you to deal by your spirit in some things in me, in my life
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:08.480]   here today. I want to respond to this word, and I want to receive from you. Lord,
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:15.760]   I want to pray for every person here whose hands are open now. Father, I want to pray that you would
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:22.720]   speak words of life, encouragement, and love to each one. Father, I want to pray that you would
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:29.040]   release, Lord, vision, excitement, and passion for the future. As I'm praying, I just sense that some
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:37.680]   of you here, there's been a time where you felt depressed, you felt weighed down, you felt like
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.320]   you don't have a spring in your step, you don't have excitement for the future. And as I'm praying,
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:47.920]   I believe that the Holy Spirit, like Paul, who had scales fall from his eyes so he could truly see
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.640]   what it is that Christ has done for him. I want to pray for some of you here right now. It feels
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.680]   like you're in a dark place. It feels like you can't see properly. It feels like you're worn out
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:02.160]   and exhausted, and you don't have hope for the future. I want to pray that scales would fall
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:10.080]   from your eyes today by the power of the Spirit so that you could see, see the wonder of his heart
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.880]   for you, how much he loves you, and the release by the Spirit that he's placing upon you.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:24.480]   So come, Holy Spirit, come. Come, Holy Spirit, come. Come, Holy Spirit, come. We're going to let
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.600]   the worship team just minister to us, but I want to encourage you just maybe to let the worship team
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.360]   just worship over you. I want to encourage you not to have to rush from this moment.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:42.160]   Just invite and allow, if your hands are open, just invite and allow the Holy Spirit to continue,
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:48.000]   just to come and speak to you and comfort you and set you free.
