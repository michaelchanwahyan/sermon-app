[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Thank you, Jason. Hey, let's give Jason a hand.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   First time service leading. Come on. That's good.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Yeah, you got some fans over there.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Well, when I was dating Chris, who's now my wife,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   so we went on several dates,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   there was a point where I was walking her to the bus stop.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And so we're walking to the bus stop, and I was like,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   "I'm going to seize this opportunity."
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   So I asked her, "Is it okay if I hold your hand?"
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   And she, without any hesitation, said, "Yeah, no."
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So I was like, "Oh, I guess I misread this situation here.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I thought we were on the same page, but apparently we're not."
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And so she went on the bus, she drove off,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   and I had a depressing walk home.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   So I was wondering, you know, how does Chris feel about me?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Like, does she like me?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Does she have the same feelings that I have?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And I was starting to question that. I was starting to worry.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So luckily that night she called me and she told me,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   "Hey, there's some friends of mine. We want to get together."
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It's like, "Oh, okay. We're getting together. Good. Good."
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   You know, there's further plans. It's not over. It's not the end.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   So then the way we defined the relationship, the DTR, right,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   was when she told me, "You can hold my hand now."
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I was like, "Okay." So there we go.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And I did, by the way, I did ask for permission to share this story
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   so I don't just tell stories from our life unless I ask her.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So there you go.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   But all of this made me think about that there are times
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   where we wonder about how others feel about us.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   For me it was in this romantic relationship.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   For some it might be you wonder how our spouse feels about us.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   For others it might be we wonder how our children feel about us.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I was talking with a father this morning.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   We have both very little children.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We're like, "Do they realize, how do they feel?"
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Because sometimes they always seem to be turning their head away
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   when we come close.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   How do they feel about us?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   So maybe as parents you wonder that.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Or maybe as a child you're wondering of your parents,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   how your parents feel for you.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Maybe even as we are older we still wonder
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   how do our parents feel about us.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But then on our spiritual journeys we also ask that question.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   How does God feel about us?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   How can I know how God feels about me, to be more specific?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And so that's what we're going to explore through this message.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   We're continuing in our sermon series through the parables,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Living in the Kingdom parables.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   We're in our second week.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We're looking at how Jesus tells these stories that confront us,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   challenge us, and that a lot of times open up a new way
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   for us to look at something or to understand something,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and where we can align ourselves with his kingdom values.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   We can adopt a kingdom mindset.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And so we're going to continue to do that today.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Now we are in the Gospel of Luke.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I'm going to just give a little bit of a brief summary
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   before we go into our passage just to set the context.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So the context is basically Jesus is hanging out with everyone.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I mean he is spending time with every type of person.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   He's hanging out with religious people.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   He's hanging out with irreligious people.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   He is with the rich, with the poor.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   But it is the religious who are getting upset
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   about what Jesus is doing.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's rubbing them the wrong way.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And so that's the context where we're going to pick up.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   We're in Luke chapter 15 and starting in verse 1,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   and it will be along on the screen so you can read along there.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It says this, "Now the tax collectors and the sinners
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   were all gathering around to hear Jesus.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   'This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.'
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Then Jesus told them this parable,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   'Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   and goes home.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   'Rejoice with me! I have found my lost sheep.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   in heaven over one sinner who repents
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   than over 99 righteous people who do not need to repent.'
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   search carefully until she finds it?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   together and says, 'Rejoice with me! I have found my lost coin.'
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And in the same way I tell you there is rejoicing
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   in the presence of angels of God over one sinner who repents."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Now before we go into these two parables,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   there's actually a few verses before,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   and I want to say a little bit about that.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   So in verse 1, we're told that the tax collectors,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   the sinners, they're drawing near to Jesus.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   They're gathering around him because they want to hear from him.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   There's just something attractive about Jesus.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   People just want to hear from him.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   They want to be around him.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   He has something to say.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   He speaks different than other people.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And so people are coming around him.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And interestingly enough, the Pharisees and the tax collectors
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   are also around him even though they have a problem with him.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And we're told that they muttered.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Now muttering or grumbling or complaining,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   you can imagine it's like you're doing it in a way,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   you're complaining about someone,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   but you do it in a way that they can hear it.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   It's kind of a little bit under your breath,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   but you make sure that the message is sent.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And so they're complaining that this man,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   they don't even call him by his name, they call him this man,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   welcomes sinners and eats with them.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Now what's the fuss all about?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Why do the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   why are they so upset about what Jesus is doing?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   There are several things that we need to understand that I want to unpack.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So let me do that.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   The first thing is we have to understand who tax collectors were.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Now tax collectors, so at this time in Israel,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   the Romans were occupying Israel.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So there's a foreign nation occupying Israel.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   They're collecting taxes, but they don't themselves collect taxes.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   They actually hire Israelites to do the tax collecting.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And I just found out that Israelites,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   they could purchase the right to do that.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So you could purchase the right to be the one who collects the taxes.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And what they did is not only that they collected taxes,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   but they also took something on top of that.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So not only are they in some sense colluding with the foreign force,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and a lot of people call them traitors, but they're also thieves.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   They're ripping people off.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   They're taking more money than they're entitled to.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   So in some sense, it's not a surprise that the Pharisees
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   are not that excited that Jesus is hanging out with tax collectors.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So that's the first thing.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   There's a mention that they're sinners.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Well, in some sense, that seems very self-explanatory, right?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And it is a general category.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   It could mean your occupation.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Maybe you're a sex worker.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It could also mean that you simply do not measure up to the righteousness,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   the standards that the Pharisees had set.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And by the way, they had like 600 and some laws.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   They went way beyond the biblical demands
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and really placed a burden on a lot of people.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And if you're not able to keep up with that, you're part of the sinners.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   You're part of the irreligious people.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   But then there's a third factor that we have to understand,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   and that is cultural, and that is table fellowship.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   So Jesus, he's not just spending time with them.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It actually indicates in the passage that he's inviting people.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   He's hosting people.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   He's hosting tax collectors.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   He's hosting sinners.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And in that cultural context, if you're inviting somebody to eat with you,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   it means there's friendship, there's association, there's acceptance.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   And that is what really rubs the Pharisees
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   and the teachers of the law the wrong way.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   But of course, this is part of Jesus' gospel message,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   his good news message.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And actually through spending time with broken, with hurting,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   with sinful people, he's actually living out his message.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Jesus actually reflects his message that forgiveness and life in the kingdom
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   are available through him.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   However, the religious leaders, they have a different perspective on that.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   They're like, "We don't want none of that.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   You're spending time with people who show disregard for God,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   and you feel good about hanging out with them.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So by doing that, you really undermine the social structures
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   and what's called good and what's called bad."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And so they're very upset.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Now, the problem, of course, is that they can't see that Jesus is God in flesh,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   that he is God's son, and that he is showing God's heart
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   for broken, for sinful, for hurting people.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   By associating them, by spending time with them,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   by welcoming them into his kingdom,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   by looking to restore them back to the Father.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And so in response to this, Jesus tells a parable
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   because he wants to reveal God's heart.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I'm going to do heart.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   He wants to reveal God's heart, the Father's heart.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   He wants to give a window into that
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   so that the Pharisees and everyone can see God's heart for people.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   So let's look at the parables.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   So there's a parable about sheep, one that's lost,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and a parable about coins, where one coin is lost.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Now, both of those things were valuable,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   but there's an increase in value.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   One out of 100 sheep, and then one out of 10 silver coins,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and then actually there's another parable that comes afterwards.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   It's one lost son, or probably two lost sons, really.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And God, Jesus, he invites us by putting ourselves in the shoes of the shepherd,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   by putting ourselves in the shoes of the woman who lost something so valuable to her
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   that we can get in touch with God's heart for those who are lost.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Then we can start feeling what God feels.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   So basically, he's inviting us to put us into God's shoes
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   so we can experience some of God's feelings as we imagine that.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   So both parables, they start off with this imaginary thing that we're supposed to imagine.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   So in verse 4, it says, "Suppose one of you has 100 sheep and loses one of them.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?"
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   So, you know, suppose, imagine.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And then the other one, verse 8, "Or suppose a woman has 10 silver coins and loses one."
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Again, we're asked to imagine.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And so Jesus is expecting an affirmative answer.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Of course the woman's going to go look for the coin.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Of course I'm going to look for the lost sheep.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   For us, it's maybe like if we lose our diamond engagement ring.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Of course you're going to go look and search for it.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   You're not just going to let that lay. It's not a big deal.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I'm just going to not worry.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   But, you know, you're going to look for it because it's valuable to you.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Because it's something that you treasure.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Or maybe an iPhone for other people.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Your new iPhone. You bought it and you lose it.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   You're going to look for it. You want to find it.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And so Jesus is saying, "If you go search for lost items, lost things, in the way that you do,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   how much more does God search for lost people?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   How much more valuable are they to him?"
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   So the first insight that we gain with God's heart is that God actively searches for us
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   because every person is precious to him.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Every single person is precious to him.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   So he treasures you.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   He does not casually look for you a little bit and then says, "Oh, whatever."
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   No, he searches for you eagerly, ferociously to find you.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   As we continue to go through the parable, there's another theme that emerges.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And it's the theme of rejoicing.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   There's just such great joy in finding what's lost.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I mean, if you found your lost engagement ring or wedding ring, you're full of joy.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   You're excited. You text. You call.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Maybe you throw a party.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It's a big deal.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And so here we also read in verse 5, "And when he finds it," talking about the sheep,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   "he joyfully puts it on his shoulders."
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   That really stuck out to me, that the shepherd, he finds the sheep.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   You know, we don't know how far off this sheep is.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   I don't know if you've ever been around sheep.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   They're actually quite heavy.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Joyfully putting it on your shoulder, smelly, stinky sheep.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   You know?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   But he does it joyfully.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   He joyfully restores the sheep back to the sheepfold.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, "Rejoice with me.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I have found my lost sheep."
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And then there's this comparison to heaven, right, where I tell you that in the same way
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   there will be more rejoicing.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   So it's even a greater joy when lost people are found, when they repent of their sins,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   when they receive the forgiveness of Jesus.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   And then the same with the coin.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   You know, she rejoices.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   She asks others to rejoice with her as she finds it.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And then there is rejoicing, the presence of angels of God over one sinner who repents.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So Jesus in both parables, he highlights again there's the earthly scene and then there's
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   a heavenly scene and there's a comparison like you who rejoice over these lost things
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   that you find, how much more does God rejoice over lost people?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And I think theoretically we affirm that.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   I think there's a lot of theoretical things in our faith.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   But if we're honest, I'm not sure if our life actually always really shows that, that we
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   really rejoice over lost people being found, that we really care about people who are wandering,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   who are hurting.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And then maybe a lot of times we're more like the Pharisees and the teachers of the law
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   where we're frustrated with people and we, "Did you hear about those people?"
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And we say things like that.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   But Jesus, he rejoices.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And through his parable he's saying, "Do you want to know what it feels like to be God?
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Do you want to know how God feels about people?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Do you want to know how God feels about you?
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Or when one person turns to me, it feels like I just found my most valuable possession."
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Wow.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   It's amazing.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   So the second insight in the God's heart that we gain is that God loves and pursues all
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   people and that he rejoices over every person that is found, over every single person.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   But why does Jesus tell us this parable?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And why does he feel the need to reveal God's heart in these circumstances?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Well, initially we saw that he's talking to the Pharisees and the tax collectors, and
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   he is challenging them to get in touch with God's heart because their heart is not aligned
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   with God.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   They think their heart is aligned, but it's not.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And so there's a challenge to adopt a different perspective, to adopt the heart of God for
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   the people around them, to understand what Jesus is doing.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And because they're opposing the very thing that God is doing through Jesus.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   They're opposing the very thing.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   And they're not in touch with God's heart for the lost.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And they can't imagine wanting to have anything to do with broken, with hurting, with lost
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   people.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   They just want to hang out with their crew, their righteous crew.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   And I think that's another thing for us in the church.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   A lot of times we're just happy to go to our fellowships.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   We're happy to be around people that are wonderful and great.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   But actually, if push comes to shove, and that's why earlier I said that a lot of times
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   parts of our faith are theoretical, actually we don't really want to cross those barriers
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   that Jesus crosses and spend time with people who just have messy lives, who are not liked
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   by society, where we might even get in trouble for associating with them.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   But what I love about Jesus is he doesn't just scold the Pharisees.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It's actually an invitation for them.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   And so he's inviting us as well.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   You know, to have that same heart that God has for the lost.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And actually one thing we can do is we can ask the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   love for the lost.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Because nothing that I say here will change your heart, but it's God's work in your heart.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   It's the Spirit of God's work in your heart that changes your heart.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And so if you're feeling it, I want to encourage you to just say some prayer.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Holy Spirit, will you come into my heart and will you give me a heart for those who are lost?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Will you change my heart?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Because I can't do it on my own strength.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Now what's interesting is that the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, actually their
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   attitude and their contempt, it shows that there are actually also people who are far
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   away from God.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   They also need rescuing.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   They also need to be restored back to the Father.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   They also need compassion from those who know God.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   So even the religious, you know, the self-righteous, God also cares about them and longs for them
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   to be restored.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   But one thing that I haven't highlighted in the parable is in verse 3, yes, you know,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   the parable is addressed to the Pharisees and the tax collectors, but actually it is
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   also, remember who Jesus is talking to or who's listening to him, it's the tax collectors
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and the sinners.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   So he's also giving a window into God's heart for the tax collectors and the sinners.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Because they need to also know how God feels about them.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Because the message they've been getting is, "You do not measure up.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   You don't belong.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   You are awful.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   You have no place here."
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   That's the message that they've been sent.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   That's the kind of vibe that the Pharisees sent to the people.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And so they need to also know God's heart.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Because usually we know that our lives are messed up.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   We don't need somebody else to usually tell us that.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   You know, we know the things that we've done that are wrong.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   But if the message is that there's no hope for us, then why bother?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   You know, but Jesus is saying there's hope.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And I want you to know God's heart for you.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   So in strong contrast, Jesus reveals God's heart through these stories
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   to those who are rejected, broken, those who are carrying shame and hurt and self-hatred.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And he's saying, "You're just the kind of person that I want to spend time with
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   and that I would want to restore back to the Father."
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Jesus himself said about himself, "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   That's why he came.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   This is why he's come, to reveal once and for all God's love for all people.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Through his life, through his ministry, through his teachings, through his parables,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   through his death, through his resurrection.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And it's ultimately, you know, on the cross that this question that I earlier raised,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   "How can I know how God feels about me?"
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   That that question is answered.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Because it shows how God feels about you.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   He loves you so much.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   It doesn't matter what you have done.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   That he came to this earth, humbled himself, laid down his life for yours and took your place.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Observed the punishment, the judgment that you deserved.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   So that you can be forgiven, that you can be set free,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   that you can receive a new life in Jesus.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   So Jesus doesn't just say, "Oh, I love you," or "I tell great parables."
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   He puts his words in the actions.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And he dies for you.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Now as I was preparing this message,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   you know, the one thing that stuck out to me in both parables was
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   how in both parables it's the one that the shepherd and that the woman goes after.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   The one lost sheep and the one coin.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And the same is true for us.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   God doesn't come after us in a general way.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And, you know, let me go over, you know, seven billion people in a general way.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   He always goes after the one that is lost.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   It's personal.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   And nothing else would bring him greater joy
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   than finding that one lost person and restoring that person back to the Father.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   He wants you to come back home.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   He wants you to know that you are not too far away from him.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   It's not too late.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   God seeks after you even if you've messed it up.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   This is also true for Christians as well because even as Christians on our journey,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   sometimes we just mess it up majorly.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And we feel like we don't deserve to come back to God.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   He doesn't love us.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   There is no second chance for us.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   But there is.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   It doesn't matter what bad choices you made.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   It doesn't matter what you have done.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   He wants to restore you back to the Father because he loves you.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   And he loves you so deeply and so dearly.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And his heart breaks for you, for the one, until you are restored back to him.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Now some of us here, we feel like we are not valuable enough to be sought after.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   There's been also messages in your life that have been sent to you
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   that you don't belong, that you shouldn't even come here, there's no hope for you.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And this reminded me of a story where I was in the Department of Motor Vehicles in California, DMV.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I was standing in line and there was a person who was experiencing homelessness.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   And he asked me to help him fill out--I was renewing my driver's license
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   and he needed a government ID and he asked me if I could help fill him out the form.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Because life on the streets, drugs and alcohol and sleeping under weather conditions and everything,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   he didn't have the motor skills anymore to fill out forms.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   And so I was filling out the form for him and then got to the point where there was a question
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   where he asked, "Do you want to donate your organs?"
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   And so I asked him, "Would you like to be an organ donor?"
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   He said, "Me? I am junk. Who would want my organs?"
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Now he was a man that had been getting the message that he was junk,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   that he was not worthy, that he did not belong,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   that his life was too messed up to be of any value.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And at some point in time he just believed it because that's the message that was being sent to him.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   But that's not how Jesus feels about him.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   For Jesus, he is a lost treasure that needs to be restored to him.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   He's not junk. He's made in the image of God.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And he longs to bring him back to the Father.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   And when he does, there is rejoicing and there's a party and there's a celebration like you have not seen before.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Because the one who is lost is found and is restored.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And so you, excuse me,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   you are God's treasure that he loves and that he is seeking to restore.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Now I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   You are God's treasure that he loves and that he is seeking to restore.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Now as I was praying for the day, I had a word.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   And the word was that there's a man here that feels like he has messed it up too much to be restored to God,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   to receive his forgiveness, to be made, brought home, to be made whole.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   But as we heard today, you know, you are not too far away.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And this is true for everyone, you know, for this man, but also for everyone else.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   You know, God loves you and he wants to restore you back to him.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Now, even if you would be the only single person in this world,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Jesus would still die for you on the cross.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   He would still lay down his life for you and he would still go after you because you are worth it.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Because he loves you that much and he wants you to know that.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   And he wants you to be found and he wants you to be part of the family of God.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   He wants you to know God and experience the life that he gives.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And so what I want to do right now is I want to actually just create an opportunity for you to open your heart
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   and to be found and to welcome in Jesus into your heart.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Now, you can imagine this picture of, you know, your heart having a door
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   and there's only a door handle on the inside.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   You know, Jesus doesn't force himself into the door, but he's knocking.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And it's only you who can welcome him in.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And he said, "Come into my life.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Forgive me and give me that new life in you."
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And so I'm going to--the way we do that is by praying a simple prayer.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   It's like saying that we're sorry, we say thank you, and we say please.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   So I want to invite those of you who want to pray this prayer, you can pray this,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   you can quietly make this your own.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   And so let me pray this prayer for us.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Jesus, thank you so much that you love me so much.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I'm sorry for all the things that I've done wrong.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And actually, right now, you can tell Jesus the things that you've done wrong
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   and ask him for forgiveness.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   So I'll give a little time for that.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me on the cross
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   so that I can be forgiven and that I can be set free.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I receive your forgiveness now.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   And I place my trust in you.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Will you come by your Holy Spirit into my heart,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   and will you be with me forever?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   I want to invite everyone to stand.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Now, if you've prayed this prayer,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   now you, there's rejoicing in heaven.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   There's a party going on,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   because the one who was lost has been found,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   and is restored to the Father.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   And I just want to encourage you if you pray this prayer,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   just let somebody know.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Let them celebrate with you.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Maybe somebody brought you, maybe somebody from the staff.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   We would be so excited for you.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   And we also would love to help you, you know, take those next steps with Jesus.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   But I also would love to pray for us,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   because I feel like even though theoretically we know that Jesus loves us,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   we don't always feel it.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   And we also wonder, does God really love me?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   So perhaps if you're feeling that,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   I want to invite you just to stretch out your hands before you.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   If you're just wondering, or you just want a deeper sense of God's love,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   just as an expression of openness to God, you can stretch out your hands.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And I would just love to pray over you.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Jesus, I thank you that you love every single person here,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   and that your love is so deep and so strong for every single one of us.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Lord, you know everyone's story here right now.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   You know, for those of us who just wonder about that, maybe we doubt your love.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   But I pray that by your Holy Spirit, you will come into our hearts.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   You will flood our hearts with your love.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   You will make your heart, your love known to us.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   How great your love is for us.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   How you have not forgotten us.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   How you are there for us.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   How you are with us every single moment of the day.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   So will you reveal this to us, Lord?
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Because we're struggling sometimes to see it.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Will you pour out your love into our hearts right now by your Holy Spirit?
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   As your word says in Romans 5, 5, you know that you pour your love into us.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Will you make your love known to us in tangible ways that we have not known before?
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And will you strengthen your people?
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   So I pray all that in your name, Jesus.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Amen.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Let's worship.
