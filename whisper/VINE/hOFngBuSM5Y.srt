1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
 We're so glad you're here.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,400
 Perhaps you just arrived in Hong Kong and you're settling into the city.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,400
 And we're so glad that you're here and glad that you're discovering churches in our city.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,920
 And there's lots of great churches in Hong Kong.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,120
 We encourage you to check out a number of churches.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,720
 But if this is your heart, this is your home, we're so grateful that you're here.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,680
 Perhaps you're visiting, maybe you're part of a family or maybe you're visiting family

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,840
 that live in Hong Kong in this season.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,680
 We're glad you're here.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,680
 I'm really excited.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,920
 I normally here at the Vine, we preach in series.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
 That's what we do.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,080
 So we normally do four to week, four weeks, six weeks, 10 week series, something like

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,080
 that.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,380
 But every once in a while in between series, I get a chance to do a one-off message with

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,720
 you and that's what today is.

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,160
 And I have a something on my heart that I've been caring for us as a community for some

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,580
 time.

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,500
 Something that is very dear to my heart because it's a message I'm preaching to myself this

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,920
 morning.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,920
 Everything I'm saying to you this morning, I'm speaking into my spirit because I desperately

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,240
 need this.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,360
 I want to read you a passage of Jesus.

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,120
 One of the most beautiful things I think Jesus says to the crowds as he's teaching in Galilee.

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,520
 You've already heard it actually, Justin read it to us just a bit earlier.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,360
 This is Matthew chapter 11, starting in verse 28.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,600
 And I wonder whether you could hear these words and have these words go into your spirit

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,280
 and soul this morning.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,640
 Jesus says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,680
 I don't believe that there's any more beautiful promise in scripture than that.

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,880
 "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart and you

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
 will find rest for your souls.

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,240
 For my yoke is easy, my burden is light."

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,560
 Father, as we open your scriptures, would you open us?

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,680
 Would you just take a moment to recognize the weariness and the burden that you carry?

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:07,440
 Father, we enter into this space recognizing the need we have for your rest.

37
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:16,240
 Holy spirit, as we open this passage, would you, Lord, I pray, lift burdens, lift weight,

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,000
 renew joy.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,240
 We pray this in Jesus name.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,800
 Jesus says, "Amen."

41
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,600
 These words are profound to me.

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,480
 They're some of the most famous words of Jesus in all of scripture.

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,760
 In fact, these words have been reproduced on cheesy Christian fridge magnets, bumper

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,120
 stickers, t-shirts, coffee mugs, in our modern time IG posts.

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,040
 I'm sure you've seen these words somewhere on your Instagram feed at some time.

46
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,600
 I, in fact, posted these words on my Instagram feed earlier this week.

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,940
 These are famous and familiar words.

48
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,760
 And they're famous and familiar words for a very important reason, for actually a very

49
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,360
 critical reason.

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:03,080
 Because in these words, Jesus offers us something that speaks to a need that is in every human

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
 being.

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,920
 And I would argue a need that is in every modern human, maybe in a time of history like

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,280
 never before.

54
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,080
 And that is the need for rest.

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,160
 Yes, this beautiful idea of rest.

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,480
 I mean, if you could think about it, I don't think there's a better word or a better promise

57
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:32,400
 in all of scripture for us who are stressed out, burnt out, exhausted, overwhelmed, overproducing,

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,720
 overfocused, kind of overworked, sort of stressed.

59
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,320
 All the things that we know we are in Hong Kong.

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,400
 Could there be a better promise to us than this?

61
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,800
 In fact, I'm kind of surprised that when Jesus wrote this, he didn't start by saying to the

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:54,320
 people of the church in Hong Kong, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and

63
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
 I will give you rest."

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,480
 This should resonate with you here this morning, because this is July and you're still in Hong

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,800
 Kong, which means that you're not on vacation right now.

66
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
 So you are a people desperately in need of rest, amen?

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,920
 The empty chairs, normally the 915 doesn't have any empty chairs in it.

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,200
 The empty chairs you see around you are the people that chose to be on vacation this morning,

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
 okay?

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,800
 So you are here.

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,200
 And if you're anything like me, when you think about rest, you're crying out and you're like,

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,680
 "Man, this sounds good."

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,520
 I mean, we know the stress and the burnout and the exhaustion, the tiredness, the overwhelmed.

74
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,360
 We know the hard work that a boss puts upon us.

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,600
 We know how desperately our physicality, our emotions, and our minds, our spirits, and

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,960
 our souls need rest.

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,960
 And when we hear this from Jesus, we are just crying out, "Yes and amen," more and more.

78
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,560
 But here's the reality, what Jesus is actually speaking about in this passage is actually

79
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,680
 a lot different from what we think that He's speaking about.

80
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,400
 In fact, what Jesus is calling us into in this passage is different from what we hope

81
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,120
 He's calling us into.

82
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,680
 What we think we need when Jesus says rest.

83
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,520
 You see, you've got to understand that in our modern context, when we read this and

84
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,440
 we hear Jesus say, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you

85
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,720
 rest," we immediately have our modern thinking about what we think we need when we think

86
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,080
 of the idea of rest.

87
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,040
 And when Jesus says, "Come to me and you will find rest," we think that Jesus is inviting

88
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,860
 us on a permanent vacation.

89
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,860
 We think Jesus is literally inviting us to drink pina coladas on the beach in Bali.

90
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,700
 We think this is amazing because we're stressed out, we're exhausted, we're desperately in

91
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,760
 need of ceasing our productivity.

92
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,300
 So when Jesus says, "Come to me and I will give you rest," what we think He's saying

93
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,460
 is, "Come to me and you can cease your productivity.

94
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,740
 Come to me and you can put work aside.

95
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,960
 Come to me and you'll never have to work a day in your life."

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,960
 And when we hear that, we're like, "Yes and amen!"

97
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,380
 I mean, who here doesn't want to put work aside and kind of get rid of all that exhaustion

98
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,100
 and just spend the rest of our lives kumbaya-ing with Jesus?

99
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,900
 I mean, that sounds amazing.

100
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,020
 And so when we read this, we're exactly like that.

101
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,980
 We're like, "Give this to me, Jesus."

102
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:27,560
 And Jesus is like, "That's about as far away from what I'm trying to say through this passage.

103
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,780
 You're desperately in need of finishing work.

104
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,600
 I want to renew work inside of you.

105
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,820
 So come to me, you who are currently weary and burdened because of the way in which you

106
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:48,220
 are working, and I will change everything."

107
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,540
 See what Jesus is actually saying is something far grander and far bigger and far more amazing

108
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,380
 than we could ever imagine.

109
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,580
 And when we just catch a glimpse of what it is that Jesus is trying to teach us in this

110
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:07,300
 verse, what happens to us is that we shift away from desperately needing to escape from

111
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,680
 this life to desperately wanting to lean into this life.

112
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
 Come on, church.

113
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,420
 I know this is the summer, but come on, church.

114
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,660
 Are you okay?

115
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,700
 We want to desperately escape life, and so we think that Jesus, when he offers our rest,

116
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,700
 our ticket to escape life, Jesus is like, "No, when you understand what it is to come

117
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,820
 to me, you are revolutionized to live the life that you were actually created to live

118
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,820
 in the first place."

119
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,580
 You've got to understand that when Jesus says, "Come to me, all you who are in burden, and

120
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,140
 I will give you rest," he's actually not speaking to modern Hong Kong.

121
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,700
 He's speaking to first century Galilee.

122
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,820
 He's speaking to people who were farmers, people who were workers of the field, people

123
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:56,700
 who were average, everyday people in the first century living under the exhaustion of empire.

124
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,860
 Jewish people, Jewish people who understood their scriptures and were looking for the

125
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,100
 Messiah, Jewish people who understood that God had set something up at the beginning

126
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:13,580
 of all time in this area of rest that had been disrupted by sin, and now we're desperately

127
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,720
 waiting for the Messiah to come to bring them back into a place of biblical rest, which

128
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,220
 let me tell you, unfortunately, is not a pina colada on a beach in Bali, but is something

129
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:31,260
 much greater and actually the thing that you really need.

130
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,060
 To understand that, we have to step out of our modern context and step into the biblical

131
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,060
 context.

132
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,060
 We need to do that by going to my favorite three chapters of the Bible.

133
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,320
 Do you know what my favorite three chapters of the Bible, you should know this by now

134
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
 if you come to the Vine.

135
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
 One of my favorite three chapters of the Bible, everyone.

136
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,160
 All right, I got work to do.

137
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,500
 Genesis 1, 2, and 3.

138
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,080
 We just spent a whole month in those passages in our justice series.

139
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
 Genesis 1, 2, and 3.

140
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,800
 What you see in Genesis 1 and 2 is that God sets up something for humanity.

141
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,100
 I like to call it this way.

142
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,760
 In the whole of the creation moment in Genesis 1 and 2, the pinnacle, the climax, the creation

143
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,520
 of humanity, the placing us within the garden, God then gives us two essential rhythms for

144
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
 human flourishing.

145
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,840
 Let me unpack these briefly for you.

146
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,720
 Two essential rhythms to your human flourishing.

147
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,720
 The rhythm of work and the rhythm of rest.

148
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,660
 It's important you have to understand that we were created to work.

149
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,720
 God actually in Genesis 1 and 2, when he creates humanity, he places them in the garden and

150
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,800
 then God gives these words to humanity.

151
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,880
 He says, "I want you to go into the garden, go into creation, and I want you to steward

152
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
 it.

153
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,680
 I want you to bring it to the fullness of what it was created to be."

154
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,880
 This mirrors what God had done in the larger work of creation.

155
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,200
 Remember, humanity is made in the image of God.

156
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,640
 We see in the wider story of Genesis 1 and 2 in God's creation that he creates through

157
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,560
 the Spirit and takes something that's formless, gives it form, and then moves it to its fullness.

158
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,080
 So, us being made in his image, God then places us into creation and he says, "I want you

159
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,680
 to do the same thing.

160
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:13,660
 This is what work is, partnering with me to take something into its fullness, partnering

161
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,080
 with me to flourish my creation."

162
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:23,380
 So, work in its very essence is grounded in a partnership with God and it's grounded

163
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,520
 in us imaging him by working with our hands.

164
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,560
 That might mean physically our hands, it might mean just our gifts and our talents, however

165
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,120
 we might do it, in order to bring things into its flourishing so the world would truly be

166
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,400
 as it was created to be.

167
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,920
 Does that make sense?

168
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,600
 And when we do that, human beings come alive and they don't need pina coladas on the beach

169
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,140
 in Bali.

170
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
 They find life.

171
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,880
 So, you've got to see that there's a rhythm that God has created where we are created

172
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,000
 to work before Genesis 3.

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,520
 I want you to see work was a good thing.

174
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,640
 Everyone say, "Amen."

175
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,640
 Even the bankers and the lawyers in this room, say, "Amen," with me.

176
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
 Come on.

177
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
 I'm sorry.

178
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
 I love it.

179
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
 I used to be a banker, by the way, so that's okay.

180
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
 I can say that.

181
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,320
 On the other side, though, God then institutes this idea of rest.

182
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 Oh, everybody say, "Amen."

183
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 Okay, thank you.

184
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
 Just one person.

185
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
 That's great.

186
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,200
 So, in rest, God does two things in Genesis 1 and 2.

187
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,800
 First of all, I want you to see that in the order of his creation, he instills rest first.

188
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,880
 There is those famous words at the end of every day of creation.

189
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,400
 He says this, "Then there was evening and morning the first day."

190
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,840
 Or he would say, "Then there's evening and morning the second day or the third day or

191
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
 the fourth day."

192
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,680
 Notice that when God describes a day, he starts with rest.

193
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
 Come on, church.

194
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
 "When there was evening and then there was morning the first day."

195
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,920
 So God sees that one of the rhythms to human flourishing, notice this, and this is really

196
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,120
 important, God has actually designed it so that we humans flourish the best when we are

197
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,760
 operating out of rest and not into rest.

198
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,020
 Come on, church.

199
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,240
 When we're operating out of a place of rest, not into a place of rest.

200
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,480
 Now all of us, when we think of vacation and holiday, here's our mentality.

201
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,180
 I'm going to work really hard because I've got a vacation coming up when I can collapse.

202
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,040
 That's working into rest.

203
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,120
 But God creates the evening and the morning, the first day, confirming to us that this

204
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,400
 is the way in which human flourishing comes.

205
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,600
 You work out of a place of rest into the renewable things.

206
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,040
 When you start from rest, you are becoming human and you flourish and you come alive.

207
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,800
 When you need rest as something to collapse into, then you've got it the wrong way around.

208
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,240
 We think of a day as, "Oh, work, work, work, work, work, and then I can get home and watch

209
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,560
 Netflix."

210
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,280
 God looks at it like rest so that you can come alive.

211
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,240
 I learned this the hard way for many years when I became a pastor.

212
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,680
 It was funny, when I was a banker, I was stressed but didn't have any physical issues.

213
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,400
 When I became a pastor, I suddenly developed IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, because I was

214
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,000
 so stressed about everything that I was doing as a pastor.

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,280
 I was weighed down by the burdens of it.

216
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,400
 I remember going to a doctor and they did all the tests.

217
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,240
 I thought I might have stomach cancer or something going on.

218
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,680
 They did all the tests and ran all the tests and nothing was in my stomach at all.

219
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,600
 No problems, no brokenness, whatever.

220
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
 So I sat down with the doctor.

221
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
 I'm like, "Doctor, I don't understand this.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
 I have bad stomach issues all the time.

223
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
 How can you tell me that my stomach is fine?"

224
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,920
 He said, "Well, it's because of how you're working."

225
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,120
 I'm like, "I don't understand."

226
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,960
 He says, "Well, tell me about your work week."

227
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,240
 So I told him about my work week.

228
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,920
 I said, "I start on a Tuesday and I work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

229
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,120
 Sunday's my biggest day and it's such a big day.

230
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,560
 We have three services on a Sunday.

231
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,040
 I preach my guts out and at the end of the day, I'm exhausted, but I have Monday to rest."

232
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,080
 He's like, "Well, your whole work week, you're working into rest."

233
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,120
 He said, "What would it look like if you worked out of rest?"

234
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
 I said, "What do you mean?"

235
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,000
 He said, "Why don't you flip your day around, rather than Monday being your day off, Friday

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 being your day off."

237
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I'm like, "I can't do that.

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Monday's my day off."

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 He's like, "Aren't you the boss?"

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I said, "Yes."

241
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,880
 He said, "Well, then change your day."

242
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
 So I did.

243
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
 I literally changed my day off to Friday.

244
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,000
 So now I work Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and I have Friday off.

245
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,960
 And then sometimes if there's stuff going on at the church, I'll work Saturday.

246
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
 Sometimes I don't need to.

247
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
 Here's the thing.

248
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,280
 Sunday, my biggest day of the week, used to be the thing I was working towards to try

249
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,760
 to finish so I could collapse afterwards.

250
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,760
 Now Sunday is the first day of my week, which is why I'm so energized when I come into church

251
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
 every week.

252
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,120
 Yes!

253
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,920
 Now I know for all of you, you got into Sunday going, "Oh my God, it's my day off."

254
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,880
 Whereas I get into Sunday going...

255
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
 Now here's the thing.

256
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,800
 As soon as I changed my work week to being Friday off rather than the Monday off, it

257
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,640
 totally revolutionized my life and I don't have IBS anymore because I was actually designed

258
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,600
 to work out of rest, not work into rest.

259
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,960
 What would it look like for you to change the rhythms of your life?

260
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,480
 Now you might go to your boss tomorrow and say, "I want Fridays off."

261
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,880
 And they're like, "No, no, not going to happen."

262
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,280
 So you got to work out how this is going to work for you.

263
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,840
 My boss is Jesus, so I'm good.

264
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,320
 But you, you know...

265
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,960
 But what would it look like for you to work out of a place of rest, not work into a place

266
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
 of rest?

267
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
 Does that make sense to you?

268
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,440
 Just even that thought for some of you here today is revolutionary for you.

269
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
 Now here's the second thing though in the creation narrative, right at the end of it

270
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,960
 on the seventh day, we know what happened, right?

271
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,880
 What did God do on the seventh day?

272
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
 He rested.

273
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
 Now here's the error.

274
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,580
 Again, we apply our modern understanding to rest to that concept.

275
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,440
 So we often think, "Well, God was exhausted from all of his hard work of things, so on

276
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,660
 one day he had to rest."

277
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,100
 Now the actual Hebrew word that's used for rest here means, better translated, "ceased."

278
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,680
 So what it means is he ceased from his work, he ceased from his producing, not because

279
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,520
 he was exhausted, but because he was done.

280
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
 The very different concept.

281
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:05,000
 In other words, the world was just as it should be, so God didn't need to do anything more.

282
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,480
 Not that he was exhausted and needed rest.

283
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,920
 He's not going into rest.

284
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,340
 He's saying, "No, everything is just as it should be."

285
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,800
 And he stands back from that and says, "This is very good."

286
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,980
 It's a little bit like, imagine an artist with a beautiful painting and they've been

287
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,740
 working on the painting for months, and there's that moment right at the end where they put

288
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,000
 the last brushstroke of ink or paint onto that painting, and then they stand back and

289
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,800
 they look at it and they go, "Hang on a sec.

290
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,360
 It's done."

291
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,080
 And they put the paintbrush down.

292
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,400
 Not because they're exhausted, but because it is finished.

293
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,080
 So God stands back from his creation and says, "This is very good."

294
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,200
 Now here's the mistake we make because of this later on in the law, later on through

295
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,960
 the Exodus and further on.

296
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,540
 This day gets created as the Sabbath day for humanity, for the Jewish people, where one

297
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,300
 day a week they cease their work, they put it all down in order to connect with God,

298
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,340
 rely on him, rest as well.

299
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:03,180
 So Sabbath is established because of this seventh day that God rested.

300
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,340
 But I want you to see that in the Genesis 1 and 2 narrative, this is naturally not speaking

301
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,860
 about Sabbath.

302
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,100
 That was institutionalized later.

303
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,440
 What it's saying here is this is Shalom, not Sabbath.

304
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,980
 This is God standing back and saying, "This is just as it was created to be.

305
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,760
 Everything is where it should be.

306
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,500
 This is a place of peace.

307
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,860
 This is rest."

308
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,540
 Are you with me?

309
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,460
 So when Jesus says, "Come to me, all you who are wearing burdens, and I will give you rest,"

310
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,300
 he's not speaking about Sabbath.

311
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,580
 Come on, church.

312
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,700
 Now Jesus teaches on Sabbath in other places, often to try to revolutionize Sabbath because

313
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,420
 Sabbath had become a burden to people.

314
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,780
 He tries to liberate them from it.

315
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,960
 But in Matthew 11, he's not speaking about Sabbath.

316
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,560
 He's not talking about a rest where just get away on vacation for a while and everything

317
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,160
 will be reset for you.

318
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,200
 He's actually talking about something much deeper.

319
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,080
 He's actually going back to Genesis 1 and 2, the last brushstroke, stepping back and

320
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,280
 saying, "Everything is right again."

321
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,480
 Now we know what happens in Genesis 3, don't we?

322
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,080
 In Genesis 3, everything changes.

323
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,320
 Because in Genesis 3, there's Adam and Eve, and they take the fruit that they shouldn't

324
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,520
 have taken from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

325
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,220
 We know that sin comes into the context, and sin disrupts everything.

326
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,960
 Remember those four relational contexts we were talking about in our justice series?

327
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,040
 Us with God, us with ourselves, us with others, us with creation, all created for us in Genesis

328
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,360
 1 and 2 as good.

329
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,280
 All four of those are disrupted because of sin in Genesis 3.

330
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
 And because our relationship with God breaks, our relationship with ourselves breaks, our

331
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,880
 relationship with everybody else breaks, and our relationship even with creation breaks,

332
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,600
 sin impacts everything that was established in Genesis 1 and 2, including, most importantly,

333
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,020
 the essential rhythms for human flourishing.

334
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,680
 Our rhythm of work and our rhythm of rest, totally disrupted.

335
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,840
 In fact, I want to show you how this impacts specifically our rhythms of work.

336
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,640
 Let me take you to Genesis 3, and I'm just going to read from a few verses, from verses

337
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
 17 to 19.

338
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
 It says this.

339
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,520
 It says this is God speaking to Adam and Eve after the reality of the sin.

340
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,960
 He said, "Cursed is the ground because of you.

341
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,580
 Through painful toil you will now eat of it all the days of your life.

342
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,320
 It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.

343
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,800
 By the sweat of your brow you will eat the food until you return to the ground since

344
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,240
 from which you were taken.

345
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,240
 For dust you are, and to dust you will return."

346
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,800
 So in trying to explain the impact that sin has had on the essential rhythms for human

347
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,080
 flourishing, God says, "Don't you realize that now work and rest is going to be completely

348
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
 different for you."

349
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,560
 Notice the language he uses here.

350
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,320
 He says, "It will now be a place of toil for you.

351
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,200
 It will be a place where there will be a sweat of your brow."

352
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
 Like this is not a good thing.

353
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,200
 What was supposed to be a place of your great flourishing will now become a place of burden.

354
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,600
 I want you to see something really important here, church.

355
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,720
 God is not saying work is evil.

356
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,740
 He's saying humanity is evil.

357
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,760
 He's not saying work is sinful.

358
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,720
 He's saying humanity is sinful.

359
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,120
 He's saying now the ground is cursed because of you.

360
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
 Because of what you've done.

361
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,840
 Because of the reality of bringing sin into this world.

362
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,560
 Everything now changes, and here's what's produced.

363
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,880
 What's produced is a breakdown in all of those relational contexts, and now a desire for

364
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,560
 us to try to fix things.

365
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,880
 Because before we were fully filled in peace with our relationship with God, our relationship

366
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,360
 with ourselves, our relationship with others, our relationship with creation.

367
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,240
 Now everything has wrecked.

368
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,760
 And because everything's wrecked, we think now as humans, how do we get back to Genesis

369
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,000
 1 and 2?

370
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,680
 And here's what we end up doing.

371
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,520
 We take that burden onto our shoulders.

372
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,240
 In the place of feeling uncomfortable about how everything is broken around us, we try

373
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,720
 to fix everything.

374
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,000
 And when humanity tries to fix everything, guess what happens?

375
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,080
 You get exhausted.

376
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,720
 You see, when our relationship with God is broken, here's our immediate fix for it.

377
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,200
 Well, I guess I'm going to have to be God myself.

378
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,240
 Well, I'm going to have to take on all the responsibilities.

379
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,640
 I'm going to have to try hard.

380
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,320
 I'm going to have to provide for everyone.

381
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,680
 I'm going to have to control everything around me, and that is exhausting.

382
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,720
 When our relationship with ourselves breaks, here's what happens.

383
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,400
 The Bible calls it that we have an orphan spirit inside of us.

384
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,480
 In other words, we no longer have a connection with our Father.

385
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,440
 We no longer have that, "This is my son, whom I love.

386
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,880
 With him I am well pleased."

387
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,960
 Instead, we feel torn apart inside of us.

388
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,100
 We feel shame about who we are because of the sin on us.

389
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,560
 And so we try to cover that up as best we can, or we try to prove that we're worthy

390
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,440
 of love, or prove that we're somebody in this world.

391
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,720
 And we try to label success upon ourselves, or strive really hard to try to make a name

392
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,360
 for ourselves, and we wonder why we're exhausted.

393
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,800
 And then our relationship with others breaks, which makes sense because if this thing's

394
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,480
 broken and if this thing's broken, then we're going to really struggle to make this thing

395
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
 work.

396
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,800
 And as we look around us and the relationships in our lives, here's what happens.

397
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,080
 We start trying to create relationships to try to fill the void that is inside of us.

398
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,120
 And so we find and we move from relationship to relationship, from dating to dating, sometimes

399
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
 from marriages to marriages.

400
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,240
 And we're trying to use people around us to try to feel better about what's broken inside

401
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,280
 of us, and we wonder why we're exhausted.

402
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,920
 And then even our relationship with creation breaks, and either we just ignore it and exploit

403
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,680
 it and couldn't care less, or we do the opposite, which is, I think, even worse.

404
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,640
 Well, maybe not worse, but just as bad.

405
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
 We worship it.

406
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,760
 We think that creation is the place that's going to fix everything.

407
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,160
 And so it's mother nature this and mother nature that, and if only I can get back to

408
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,300
 the rhythms of the earth.

409
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,280
 We become new age and we worship creation around us.

410
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,660
 All of these things are happening in our lives, and they create a drive within us to try to

411
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,280
 fix ourselves because of the brokenness of sin.

412
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,520
 I call this a striving mentality.

413
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,680
 Are you following this?

414
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,240
 All of us have this striving mentality.

415
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:22,840
 Think about it, where we were once operating out of a place of rest into a place of thriving

416
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,540
 before sin, now we are operating out of a place of disorder into a place of striving

417
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,960
 because of sin.

418
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,760
 You follow that?

419
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,360
 And this striving mentality that is in work around all of us is causing us to try to prove

420
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,760
 ourselves, try to work harder, to try to do this and that, and we're trying to do something

421
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:49,440
 which we were never created in the first place to do, and we are burnt out, we are exhausted,

422
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:57,140
 we are weary, we are stressed, and it is a horrible way to live.

423
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,080
 And when we're finding all of that at work within us, no wonder there's this disruption

424
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,280
 inside of us.

425
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,760
 And we're trying to fix ourselves and we realize that we can't.

426
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:15,440
 What we have to understand is that any time we strive to try to restore what is broken

427
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,880
 within us because of sin in any other source other than Jesus himself, we will only become

428
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,800
 more and more exhausted and less and less free.

429
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
 Come on, church.

430
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:34,240
 It's just the reality of the human life.

431
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,760
 This was how the people in the first century were feeling.

432
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,980
 They weren't in need of some nice drink on the beach in Bali.

433
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,360
 They were in need of a revolution in their soul.

434
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,920
 They were in need of becoming what it really truly meant to be human again.

435
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,800
 And so Jesus shows up and he says these words, and I wonder if they'll sound a little different

436
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 to you now.

437
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:04,540
 "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."

438
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,400
 The words that Jesus uses for weary and burdened here, weary means striving to the point of

439
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,280
 exhaustion, working to the point where I have nothing left in energy.

440
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,940
 The word burdened here literally means carrying a weight which I cannot bear or being overwhelmed

441
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,520
 in heaviness that I was not created to carry.

442
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,640
 These are the only two times in the whole of the gospels that Jesus uses these specific

443
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
 words.

444
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,060
 He's talking into what happened because of sin in Genesis 3, and he's saying, "If any

445
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:44,580
 of you here feel this weariness, feel this burden, there is help."

446
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,580
 What is the help?

447
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,620
 He says, "Come to me."

448
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,080
 I love this.

449
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,060
 Jesus doesn't offer a 12-step plan to reduce striving in your life.

450
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:00,760
 Jesus doesn't give a guide or a strategy to try to help you to balance better the stress

451
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,280
 around you.

452
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,780
 God is not interested in reducing your striving.

453
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,460
 He wants to eliminate it.

454
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,700
 Come on, church.

455
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,860
 He's not interested in just helping you to manage your stress a little better.

456
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,860
 He doesn't want you to have three days off, four days off, and only work two or three

457
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,740
 days and get the balance better.

458
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:24,660
 Jesus wants to eliminate the need that you have to rest by discovering that in relationship

459
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,740
 with him, we find our rest.

460
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,420
 That our relationship with him changes everything for us.

461
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,980
 And Jesus says, "Come to me."

462
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,660
 He doesn't say, "Earn me."

463
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,620
 He doesn't say, "Work hard for me."

464
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,020
 He doesn't say, "Try to prove yourself for me."

465
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
 Us Christians, we get this wrong all the time.

466
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,760
 We take our striving mentality to try to make ourselves look like something in the world

467
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,940
 around us, and we apply that to our faith in Jesus.

468
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,820
 And because striving has become such an embedded part of our orphan spirit, when it comes to

469
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,020
 Jesus, we strive to win his affections.

470
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,900
 We strive to do more Bible studies.

471
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,380
 We strive to do this.

472
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,060
 We work to prove that we are worthy of being loved.

473
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,620
 I love what Jesus says here.

474
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,260
 He says, "Come to me, all you who are perfect."

475
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,420
 No, he doesn't say that.

476
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,140
 He doesn't say, "Come to me, all you who are feeling good about life."

477
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,180
 No, "Come to me, all you who deserve to be in my presence."

478
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,660
 He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened."

479
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,580
 In other words, he doesn't say, "Clean yourself up and then come to me."

480
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,260
 He doesn't say, "Get better and then come to me."

481
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,980
 He doesn't say, "Hey, do a bunch of Bible studies, then come to me."

482
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,700
 He says, "No, I'm here in the weary and the burden that you're feeling right now, in your

483
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,140
 exhaustion and stress."

484
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:48,140
 The only qualification you need for Jesus is a weariness and a burden.

485
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:55,060
 The only qualification you need for Jesus is a weariness and a burden.

486
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:00,060
 The needier you are, the more perfect you are for Jesus.

487
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,500
 Oh, isn't that beautiful?

488
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,860
 Like the needier you are, like the more stressed out...

489
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,940
 Now, that doesn't mean that we try to get stressed out so that we can have a relationship

490
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,940
 with Jesus.

491
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,620
 Okay, don't take it to its extreme, but you know what I'm saying.

492
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,620
 Like we're qualified.

493
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,860
 Are you with me?

494
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,860
 We're qualified because we're sinners in need of a Savior.

495
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,740
 And Jesus doesn't expect you to get perfect.

496
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:26,580
 He says, "Come to me now, like today, like in the place of your stress, in the place

497
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,100
 of your sin, in the place of your weariness, in the place of your burden, in the weight

498
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,740
 that you can no longer carry.

499
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,020
 Come to me and I will give you rest right now.

500
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,740
 I will take it off your shoulders."

501
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,460
 How does he do that?

502
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,400
 How does God take it off our shoulders?

503
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,480
 That's what he says in the second half of the verse here.

504
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
 I love this.

505
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,040
 He says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart

506
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,240
 and you will find rest for your souls.

507
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,320
 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

508
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,520
 I love this.

509
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,720
 Jesus is so counter-cultural and sometimes he says things that seem so counterproductive.

510
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,040
 Like he's just said, "Come to me and I will give you rest."

511
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,080
 And then he says, "Take a yoke upon you."

512
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,120
 And you're like, "Hang on a second.

513
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,040
 That doesn't sound like drinks on the beach in Bali.

514
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,960
 That doesn't sound like what I need."

515
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,440
 Because let me tell you what I need, Jesus.

516
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,760
 Anybody ever tell Jesus what you need?

517
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,040
 Let me tell you what I need, Jesus.

518
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,360
 I need this cessation of work.

519
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,080
 I need to put work down.

520
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,880
 I need to get rid of all of the yokes.

521
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,320
 I don't need to have any shackles.

522
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,160
 I don't want to have any responsibilities.

523
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,920
 All I want to do is be at your feet, Jesus.

524
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,620
 And Jesus is like, "No, you need to understand.

525
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,360
 You need to go back to Genesis 1 and 2 and remember what are the two essential flourishings

526
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,400
 for humanity?

527
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,360
 The gift of work and the gift of rest.

528
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,840
 And when you bring those back through relationship with me into the place where they should be,

529
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
 then everything changes."

530
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,000
 So he's saying, "I'm not inviting you to a cessation of work.

531
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,720
 I'm not inviting you to a permanent, eternal holiday.

532
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,680
 I'm inviting you to fresh work.

533
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,960
 Take your yoke on me.

534
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,240
 My yoke on you."

535
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:14,480
 Now a yoke, in case you're not aware, was a wooden beam that was created and shaped

536
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,540
 for farmers.

537
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,520
 And it would be a wooden beam like this that would have two loops around it that would

538
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,380
 get fastened on the neck of animals so that two animals would be yoked together, kind

539
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,960
 of caught up together.

540
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,640
 Normally, it would be oxen, and they would, through the yoke, maybe drag a plow through

541
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,180
 a field or they might drag a cart to the market, taking goods to the market.

542
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,240
 So this yoke with the things around it were for these two oxen.

543
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,300
 Now here's what you may not know.

544
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,400
 In the yoke, it was mostly made by carpenters.

545
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,600
 Come on, guys.

546
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,720
 Yokes were made of wood.

547
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,400
 Carpenters didn't make nice rickety chairs to put on the porch so you can go back and

548
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
 forth on.

549
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,800
 Carpenters, in Jesus' day, made farming tools when they lived in Nazareth and Galilee.

550
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,780
 So the chances are Jesus made a number of yokes before.

551
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,640
 So here's a yoke.

552
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,300
 Now what farmers would do is they would take a big, strong, heavy ox and they would take

553
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,800
 a less strong ox and they would yoke those two together.

554
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,920
 Rarely would they yoke two strong oxes together.

555
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,640
 Normally, a stronger ox and a slightly weaker ox.

556
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
 Why?

557
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,820
 Because the weaker ox, they're trying to grow up to be a strong ox.

558
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,800
 So then in the future, the weaker ox would then be the one on the right side carrying

559
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,580
 the heavy burden, and then there would be a more junior ox alongside of it.

560
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,920
 So a farmer would always take a strong ox and a slightly less strong ox and yoke them

561
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
 together.

562
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,600
 Now the strong ox would have a part of the yoke that fit over them and was tight and

563
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,420
 snug which meant they would carry more of the weight.

564
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,640
 The younger ox would have a slightly looser noose around it which mean it would still

565
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,760
 carry some weight but not as much as a strong ox.

566
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,960
 Are you with me?

567
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,960
 And the point of this was that the young ox would learn from the stronger ox how to carry

568
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,820
 more weight and over time would mature enough to be able to take on the fuller load.

569
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,840
 So Jesus says, "You're living life wrong.

570
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,360
 You're stressed out and striving because you've got a striving mentality.

571
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,600
 Come to me because I'm the only one that can deal with striving because of the death and

572
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,960
 resurrection on the cross.

573
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,040
 When you come in relationship to me, I will release you from a striving lifestyle and

574
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,640
 place you back into a renewal of work that is right and good."

575
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,100
 It's still like in Genesis 1 and 2, a partnership with God.

576
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,500
 You now have a partnership.

577
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,120
 You're yoked now with me.

578
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,640
 And he's like, he doesn't say this but he's basically saying, "I'm the heavy yoke.

579
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,640
 I'm the ox in here that's carrying most of the weight.

580
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,800
 I'm going to share the load with you but there's still a burden for you to carry.

581
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,200
 There's still a yoke that you should have.

582
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,400
 There's still something that is around you."

583
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,000
 But and this is why he says in the passage, he says, "Learn from me.

584
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Come on."

585
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,440
 He says, "Learn from me.

586
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
 Be with me.

587
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,280
 I'm going to partner with you, walk alongside of you.

588
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,300
 I'm not suddenly going to wave a magic wand and suddenly all your stresses and your troubles

589
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,060
 will go away.

590
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,040
 But I will yoke myself to your burden.

591
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,760
 I will be the one who will carry most of that burden.

592
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,800
 I will stand with you, walk with you, come alongside of you.

593
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,200
 I will take the heavy load.

594
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,900
 I'm not going to totally release the load from you because there's stuff you can learn

595
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,900
 from me that will strengthen you to be more like me so that in Ephesians 4 you will become

596
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,540
 more like the likeness of Christ."

597
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:32,260
 So in becoming like Jesus, he says, "Take this yoke on me," which is really a profound

598
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
 thought.

599
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:39,760
 And he says these words, he says, "For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

600
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:46,380
 The word for easy that he uses here means my yoke is kind or good or other translations,

601
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,180
 it's well fitted for you.

602
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,460
 I love that.

603
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:57,140
 This is Jesus saying, "You were always created to work.

604
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,100
 Work was well fitted to you before sin.

605
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,940
 And now because of sin and the striving mentality, we're all exhausted, absolutely.

606
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,220
 So come to me.

607
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,580
 I in my resurrection can give you the fullness of life and I will yoke you to me.

608
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:17,260
 We will partner again for work that is truly good."

609
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:24,100
 See this is biblical rest, not an invitation to the cessation of work because we're exhausted

610
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,380
 from our striving, but an invitation to the renewal of work because we have dealt with

611
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,380
 our striving.

612
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,380
 Isn't that nice?

613
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:38,220
 That actually maybe there is some amazing things that we get to do with our hands, that

614
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,140
 we get to join God with the paintbrush and the paint on the beautiful work that he's

615
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,100
 got in the world around us.

616
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,460
 But there are some things like the great commission, some things like the sermon of the mount,

617
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:54,240
 some things that are a weight upon us, but it's a glorious way.

618
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,460
 It's the way to the gospel, sharing hope into the world around us.

619
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,780
 And this is what we are invited to.

620
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,880
 Come to me, all you are weary and burdened and I will give you rest.

621
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,980
 Take my yoke upon you.

622
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,140
 And he says, "My yoke is easy.

623
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:14,260
 My burden is light, but there is still a yoke and there is still a burden."

624
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,740
 So you need to understand that what Jesus is teaching us here is that there is no such

625
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,220
 thing as a yokeless life.

626
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,980
 Come on church, no such thing as a yokeless life.

627
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,100
 Jesus is not promising a life without responsibility, a life without hard work.

628
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,260
 He's not promising a life where suddenly it's a gravy chain and kumbaya with him.

629
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,780
 No there is no such thing as a yokeless life.

630
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,260
 And actually what Jesus is saying in this passage, when he says, "Take my yoke upon

631
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,540
 you," is he's saying, "You better remove all the other yokes that are around your neck

632
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,420
 right now."

633
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,740
 It's like he's asking, I think, the reader and the hearer of that time and us today a

634
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,940
 question, "What is it that I'm currently yoked to?"

635
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,980
 Because if I stand before you today like I do, and I'm feeling exhausted and tired, I'm

636
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,780
 feeling overwhelmed and somewhat stressed, and I'm feeling the weight of the world and

637
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,740
 anxiety upon me, and I'm trying to prove that I'm a great pastor in front of all these people,

638
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,580
 then I have to realize that I am not currently yoked to Jesus.

639
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,280
 Are you with me?

640
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,180
 Because if we believe what he's saying here is true, that his yoke is easy and his burden

641
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,100
 is light, if I'm stressed out and exhausted, I better be asking myself, "I'm yoked to something

642
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,500
 other than Jesus."

643
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,080
 That's the starting point to coming to him, is to recognize what it is that you're currently

644
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
 getting yoked to.

645
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,360
 And I want you to understand, if you are yoked to anything other than Jesus, nothing else

646
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,660
 in creation has been made to carry the weight.

647
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,560
 That means you are going to be carrying the weight.

648
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,580
 It is going to be a burden to you, which is why you're feeling exhausted.

649
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:57,300
 And listen to this, you can be yoked to things that are actually on the surface good, but

650
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,180
 are not Jesus, and you will still feel exhausted.

651
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,140
 Some of you in this room, you are yoked to the vine.

652
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,220
 That's not good.

653
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,220
 We are not Jesus.

654
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,500
 Some of you in this room, you're yoked to a relationship.

655
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,500
 That's not good, because that person is not Jesus.

656
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:21,080
 Some of you here are yoked to your job, yoked to success, yoked to feeling better about

657
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,060
 yourself because you've achieved something, and that's not good because none of that is

658
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,060
 Jesus.

659
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,540
 If we are yoked ourselves to something other than Christ, we will end up taking the burden

660
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,420
 and we will end up feeling exhausted, and we will strive and strive and strive, thinking

661
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,740
 that we can fix it.

662
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:42,660
 And Jesus is like the burning bush saying, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,

663
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,580
 and I will give you rest."

664
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,300
 Amen.

665
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
 Would you stand with me?

666
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,340
 I would love to pray for you.

667
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,580
 Would you just be comfortable if this has been helpful for you this morning, just to

668
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,780
 open your hands?

669
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:09,940
 Father, we just are grateful that in this moment we get to stand before you, and we

670
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,660
 get to stand before you just as we are.

671
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,620
 No pretense.

672
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,500
 No trying to pretend.

673
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,620
 Not trying to fix ourselves or make ourselves any better than we are.

674
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:32,620
 Lord, I thank you that your invitation was to all, not to a certain few or a select few.

675
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:40,540
 Father, I want to pray for each person here in this room where they came in today feeling

676
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:50,740
 exhausted, weary, burdened, with the pressures of the world on their shoulders.

677
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,860
 Lord, we know that life is challenging and difficult.

678
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:01,540
 Lord, we understand that life is not easy, and that you don't promise us a perfect, easy,

679
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,140
 suffering, free life.

680
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,900
 But when you said to the crowds, "Come to me if you're weary and burdened, and I will

681
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,780
 give you rest, I'll give you rest for your soul," you say.

682
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,100
 Lord, that's the rest that we truly need.

683
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,220
 And we're thankful for holidays.

684
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,220
 That's great.

685
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,540
 We're thankful for days off.

686
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
 They're needed.

687
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,140
 But what you're talking about in this passage is not Sabbath, but Shalom.

688
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,220
 What you're talking about in this passage is not a break from work, but a releasing

689
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,540
 of the striving in work.

690
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:39,180
 And so Lord, for every single person here who recognizes that they've been operating

691
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:47,940
 out of an orphan spirit, that their striving is related to their ability to be accepted,

692
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,780
 to be loved, to be someone.

693
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:57,380
 Lord, would you forgive us where we look to the world to give to us what only you can

694
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,340
 provide for us?

695
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:05,700
 A new identity as sons and daughters, children of God, ones who are able to cry, "Abba,

696
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,540
 Father," where the orphan spirit no longer is upon us, but the spirit of life and life

697
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,540
 abundant.

698
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:18,420
 For you have not come to kill and destroy, to make shame, to make us feel weary and burdened,

699
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:23,780
 but you have come to give us life and life to its full.

700
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,820
 So if you are sensing that weariness, if you're sensing that burden, would you just open your

701
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,060
 hands before the Lord?

702
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:41,500
 I want to pray that the Spirit of God would minister to you personally, directly.

703
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,580
 And I feel like the Holy Spirit is wanting you to be honest with him this morning about

704
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:50,140
 what it is that you recognize you're currently yoked to.

705
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,220
 And as I was saying earlier, look, there's nothing wrong with churches.

706
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,220
 They're great and we want you to love your church.

707
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,380
 There's nothing wrong with relationships, they're needed, and we want you to love the

708
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,620
 people in your life.

709
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,380
 There's nothing wrong with a great job and success and working hard and earning good

710
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,380
 money.

711
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,420
 Nothing wrong with any of that.

712
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,500
 But when those things become the thing that we are yoked to, that's the thing that Jesus

713
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
 has an issue with.

714
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,040
 He's like, "The only thing I want you to be yoked to is me.

715
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,380
 Because when you're yoked to me, my yoke is easy.

716
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,860
 It's well fitted to you.

717
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,100
 It's not going to be a burden.

718
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,300
 There'll still be some weight.

719
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,620
 There'll still be some challenge, but it's not going to be overwhelming.

720
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,620
 You're not going to be exhausted.

721
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,940
 You're not going to be burnt out for I will be carrying the heavier load and we will be

722
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,540
 partnering together in the renewal of all things."

723
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,460
 So Lord, I want to pray for a renewal of work amongst the people in this room, not a desire

724
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:49,820
 to escape it, to cease from it, a desire to escape the world and to fall into a place

725
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,820
 of rest.

726
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:58,020
 I want to pray for a movement of God's people out of rest into the renewal of work and life

727
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,020
 ahead of them.

728
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,260
 I want to pray that the Great Commission and the Sermon on the Mount would be a joy in

729
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:09,780
 our hands, that the gospel would feel light, not a burden, but a burden that is light,

730
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,660
 that we would recognize that in all that we do, whether it's a banker or a lawyer or a

731
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:19,580
 teacher or a nurse or a doctor or a homemaker, a domestic helper, whatever it might be, even

732
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:27,100
 if we're not currently working right now, we are partnered and yoked with Jesus.

733
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:32,580
 And that in that we find new liberation in life for the glory of His name.

734
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,140
 So it is come Holy Spirit, come.

735
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,580
 So I want to encourage you just to receive what the Spirit of God has for you here this

736
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,580
 morning.

737
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,500
 And as you receive it, we're going to worship together as a community before Him.
