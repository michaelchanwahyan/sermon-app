[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   - That's great.
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.040]   As you sit down, why don't you say hi
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.320]   to the person next to you, say hey.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.320]   That was a really beautiful moment I just shared with you.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.160]   Who are you?
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.080]   So good.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.760]   Well, welcome to The Vine.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.680]   My name's Andrew.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.880]   I'm one of the pastors here,
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.120]   and we are so glad you are here with us.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.040]   And we're in week five of our Exodus series here,
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.000]   and in week five, at the end of chapter two,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.940]   everything changes.
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.060]   In fact, this is a turning point
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.460]   in the whole of the story of Exodus
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.340]   that we're looking at today.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.500]   This is a moment where God steps in
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.540]   and does what only God can do.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.300]   And just in that song that we've just been singing
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.580]   and that desire that we have for God
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.120]   to fight battles for us, God to come through for us,
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.260]   this is the moment in the story where God reveals himself.
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.440]   And in revealing himself,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.780]   he creates for his people renewed hope.
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.560]   I told you in week one of this series
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.760]   that the book of Exodus is provided to us
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.560]   and is shaped for us in five movements.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.320]   And those movements are slavery,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.320]   promise, liberation, identity, and home.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.440]   And over the last four weeks,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.520]   we've been immersed in the slavery aspect
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.280]   of those five movements.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.400]   We've been looking at the reality of slavery,
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.800]   and we've been looking at it, yes,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.480]   in terms of what the scriptures tell us about Egypt
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.560]   and about Israel and the slavery that they're going through.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.240]   But more than that, we've been focusing on stepping back
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.300]   and saying, what about our slavery?
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.280]   What about our brokenness?
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.680]   What about the stuff that we're dealing with?
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.640]   And how do these two things create and come together?
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.400]   And we've been seeing for Israel, so also for us,
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.800]   that slavery is a total thing.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.400]   Slavery is completely holistic.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.000]   We saw in week two how slavery
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.760]   was not just physical for the Israelites,
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.960]   but it was physical, emotional, social, spiritual.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.520]   And it's the same for us,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.800]   that our slavery to sin
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.180]   doesn't just impact our spiritual lives,
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.720]   it impacts everything that we are, everything that we do,
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.960]   the totality of who we are, our relationships,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.740]   what we do in our workplaces,
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.480]   how we are in our city and our neighborhoods.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.920]   All of that is impacted by the realities
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.280]   of the slavery of our sin.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.420]   And over the last four weeks,
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.160]   we've seen some pretty tough stuff.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.000]   Just last week, we saw Moses fall
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.800]   into a place of disruption and disorientation,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.960]   having worn for far too long the wrong identities,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.680]   the wrong clothes of who he truly was,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.560]   wrestling with the reality of,
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.620]   am I an Egyptian or am I a Hebrew?
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.720]   Am I an oppressor or am I a part of the oppressed?
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.380]   And we saw last week that God comes
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.520]   and begins to stir something in his heart.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.600]   And all of our journeys from slavery to freedom
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.240]   starts because God begins to burn something,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.080]   turn something, do something in our hearts.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   And Moses' heart begins to change
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.040]   and he looks out on his people.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.180]   And although he had been looking out on them for 40 years,
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.680]   on this particular day, he looks out
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.480]   and something changes, he sees them differently.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.600]   And because he sees them differently,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.160]   he decides he wants to react.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.760]   But we saw last week how he reacts.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.960]   He ends up murdering an Egyptian
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.020]   who's abusing one of his people.
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.760]   And we look at this and we can see
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.040]   Moses has the right heart, but he has the wrong method.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.480]   He has the right kind of desire,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.360]   but he has the wrong idea on how to put that together
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.460]   because slavery to sin has so immersed him
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.560]   that his identities are so broken
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.040]   that he doesn't know how to react and respond
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   to what it is that God is doing in him.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.280]   And in this rightful heart to wanna be a deliverer,
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.320]   he ends up committing the sin of murder.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.620]   And we saw last week that Pharaoh finds out about this
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.760]   and Pharaoh is so angry, so upset.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.000]   We might think, well, why?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.240]   It's because Moses had been adopted into Pharaoh's family.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.680]   This wasn't just a tiff between two leaders
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.600]   of different nations.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.640]   This was a brokenness within a family.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.220]   And the very one who was hoping to raise Moses
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.280]   to take over as Pharaoh, now that one wants to kill Moses.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.860]   And Moses is so broken by this,
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.200]   he's so torn up by all of this,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   that in fear of his life, he flees from Egypt
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.120]   and he goes all the way over as far as he can
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.320]   through the desert to a place called Midian.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.840]   And we're gonna talk a little bit more next week
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.440]   as we come to the burning bush.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.200]   I can't wait to come to the burning bush next week.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.440]   We're gonna look all about Midian then,
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   but in Midian, Moses finds himself disjointed,
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.800]   disorientated, he's a wreck of a man.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.320]   He's dealing with all this stuff
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.000]   that's happening in his identity.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.300]   And it's almost as if we're traveling
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.360]   through the first two chapters of this movement of Exodus
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.020]   and we can see how completely oppressive slavery is.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.680]   And that oppression is so deep that Moses flees
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.280]   and finds himself completely turned upside down.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.680]   And he realizes something that we all have to realize
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.420]   in our own journeys of Exodus.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.560]   And that's that we can't save ourselves.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.260]   We're not the ones who are able to free us from our sin.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.120]   We're not the ones that can free our people.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.040]   We come to this realization that actually
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.480]   we need something outside of ourselves,
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.600]   something bigger than us, something more powerful than us
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.360]   to step in and change the situation that we cannot change.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.600]   And when we try to change it like Moses did,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.100]   we only often fall more and more into sin.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.440]   Our own human effort can never create salvation for us.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.480]   And so Moses sitting at this well in Midian,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.800]   the wreck of a man, realizes that there has
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.600]   to be something more.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.960]   There has to be something outside of himself
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.200]   and he's longing for a promise.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   He's longing to get a promise that God will come through.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.960]   And I sense in this room this morning,
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.240]   and for those that are joining us online,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.000]   there's a lot of people here who are longing for a promise.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.040]   Oh God, speak to me.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.640]   God, say something to me.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.840]   Give me a promise that everything's gonna be okay.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.440]   And you have to understand that the journey of Exodus
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.800]   always begins with the coming of a promise.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.440]   The beginning of Exodus always begins
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.060]   with a coming of a promise.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:36.080]   And as bad as slavery has been, a promise now comes.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.220]   And when God brings a promise,
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.960]   just like I said a few moments ago,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.400]   nothing can hold it back.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.320]   And I wanna show you the beauty of the coming of a promise.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.720]   This is the last part of Exodus chapter two.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.120]   During that long period, remember Moses is writing,
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.680]   during that long period, the king of Egypt, Pharaoh, died.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.380]   The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out.
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.280]   And their cry to help because of their slavery
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.900]   went up to God.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.440]   God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.240]   with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.360]   And so God looked on the Israelites
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.580]   and was concerned about them.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.600]   Just a few verses in the Bible here,
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.160]   but this is a turning point in everything
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.200]   that is about to happen next in Exodus.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.960]   And I want you to see how cheeky Moses is
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.000]   right at the start here.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.880]   He once again skips over 40 years of his life.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.440]   He starts with during that long period,
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.720]   and then he basically just goes through it.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.760]   Remember last week we saw that Moses basically skips
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   from when he's a baby in the waters of the Nile
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.020]   to when he kills the Egyptian.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.960]   He just basically skips over 40 years of his life.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.280]   He does it again right here.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.840]   It's almost like he's saying, man, Midian was rough.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.680]   Midian was tough.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.640]   We're just gonna skip over all of that stuff.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.480]   So basically now Moses is like 80 years old
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.160]   as he's writing this.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.640]   And Pharaoh has died.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.120]   And you can almost get a sense as Moses is writing this
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.120]   that Israel themselves may have risen up in hope.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.760]   Pharaoh's died.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.320]   Maybe the next person that comes in
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.520]   will be more benevolent.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.240]   Maybe the next person that comes in might free us.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.840]   And before we get carried away
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.240]   that when there's a change in authority,
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.160]   we think that there's gonna be a change in slavery.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160]   Notice what it says here.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.760]   It says the Israelites groaned in their slavery
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.800]   and they cried out.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.040]   In other words, there was no change here.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.520]   The slavery has continued.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.980]   And I want you to get your head around this.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.600]   Moses has left Egypt.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.440]   He's in Midian and he's actually started a new life there.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.860]   He's free.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.540]   He gets married.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.600]   He starts having kids.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.040]   This guy's living the life.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.520]   He learns to become a shepherd.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.920]   All the while for 40 years,
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.120]   his people are still suffering.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.520]   His people are still locked in slavery.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.480]   His people are still bound by oppression and injustice.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.960]   And Moses is over here and his people are here.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.180]   No doubt Moses skips over those 40 years.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.600]   Because he wants us to understand
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   that despite this kind of conflict
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.280]   between Moses seemingly living a life here
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.880]   and his people still in slavery,
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.160]   God has not given up on them.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.520]   - Right.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.160]   - And the people need a promise more than ever before.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.560]   It says here that they are groaning and crying out.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.240]   These two words, very important,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.720]   could not be more different.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.740]   The word for groaning, the Hebrew word,
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.700]   it literally means to sigh.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.820]   I wonder if any of you have ever done that
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.260]   about something in your life.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:57.400]   To groan, it means two things in the Hebrew.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.680]   It means something that was personal and private
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.760]   and something that was done off the back of great pain.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.480]   That classic, (groans)
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.840]   is exactly what it means here.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.400]   And it's something that's personal and private,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.020]   which is really interesting because Moses,
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.680]   in describing the slavery of his people
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.280]   and the pain that they're under at this time,
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.860]   he starts with the individual
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.800]   and the personal and the private.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.480]   He starts with the reality that slavery
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.820]   was actually hurting them personally.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.920]   A few years ago, I was playing golf, about 15 years ago,
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.760]   and I'm on the 15th tee, and my game's going great.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.240]   And I've got my driver in my hand,
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.280]   I'm looking down the fairway,
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.720]   and I'm thinking this is gonna go long and straight.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.560]   If you ever play golf with me,
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.800]   you know that that's not how I play golf.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.320]   But anyway, just roll with it.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.700]   And as I go back like this,
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.280]   I do something with the lower back.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.160]   I don't know what I did.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.640]   I've done that motion many, many times in my life.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.560]   Something tweaked in my lower back.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.220]   I literally had to go on the ground,
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.080]   and I had to lie there.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.500]   I couldn't finish the round.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.440]   For about two weeks,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.800]   I had the most excruciating pain in my lower back.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.920]   And since that day, for 15 years,
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.500]   every day I still have a dull pain in my back.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:13.760]   I groan a lot about my pain in my back.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.660]   Almost constantly.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.120]   You guys probably won't know this,
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.180]   but in private, on my own, I'm like,
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.180]   I want you to resonate with this.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.500]   What is it in your life that you groan about,
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.220]   that you find so hard to shake,
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.700]   and that you have almost kind of given into
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.860]   with that eternal sigh?
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.020]   Now, this word is then contrasted
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.660]   with this other word, cry out.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.220]   Now, you could not get a whole completely different idea
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.580]   in the Hebrew than this groaning,
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.100]   which was private and individual,
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.660]   and ugh, and a cry out,
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.460]   which was public and communal and loud.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.980]   In fact, that word literally can be translated shriek.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.900]   So there's this personal reality
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.520]   for the Israelites in their slavery,
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.600]   where they're feeling something,
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.480]   and it's like, ugh, this burden of this pain.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.820]   And yet together, they are coming together,
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.820]   and they have not given up crying out for change.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.680]   Now, this is really important.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.880]   You see this because this is the reality
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.120]   for Israel right here.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.360]   They are shrieking.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.800]   They are crying out.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.320]   They're asking God to step in
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.800]   and change things and do things.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   They are asking.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.640]   The word literally means to call out in hope of response.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.720]   So they're not just going like, ah, life sucks.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.840]   They're actually going, this is not right.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.560]   This is not how I want things to be.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.400]   This shouldn't be the people of God.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.840]   We're crying out, God.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.160]   We're asking you, God, to step in, to do something.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.520]   We will not give in privately.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.440]   We're groaning publicly.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.280]   We're joining our voices together
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.800]   and saying the world should be a different place.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.520]   We shouldn't be under this oppression.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.880]   We shouldn't be facing what it is that we're facing.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.480]   We will cry out.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.600]   Now, this is shocking
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.880]   because Israel has been in slavery,
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.720]   by this time, for 100 years.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.840]   This is not like me when I pray something for God
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.440]   and after a month, he doesn't answer and I just give up.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.640]   This is 100 years of slavery.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.480]   This is probably already four generations of Israelites
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.880]   that have come and gone in that time.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.880]   And even after 100 years, they have not given up.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.600]   Even after 100 years,
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.800]   they are still crying out in their slavery,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.720]   asking God to come through.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.520]   And the reality for all of us
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.080]   is that this should shake us up.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.240]   This should change our thinking
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.320]   because it's so easy for us to get comfortable in our sin.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.720]   And when we get comfortable in our sin,
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.000]   we silence the voice that should be crying out for change.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.160]   Have you silenced a voice in you
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.560]   that should be crying out for change?
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.120]   One of the realities is that
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.480]   we become comfortable in our sin.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.040]   As we become comfortable in our sin,
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.040]   we become comfortable in how things are.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.480]   And that voice that was once inside of us
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.440]   has now come down.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.880]   And that urgent desire that we've had before,
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.200]   to be holy before God, to walk with him,
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.840]   to do as much as we can has gone.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.800]   And the reality is this.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   Some of us have silenced the cry of our soul for freedom.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.960]   Come on, church.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.800]   I need you to lean into this a little bit.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   'Cause I think this is really important for all of us here.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:59.200]   Some of us have silenced the cry of our soul
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.800]   for liberation from our sin.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:06.560]   And Israel are crying, shrieking,
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.080]   asking, pounding, believing,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.520]   shouting as loud as they can all together
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.880]   for God to step in and do something.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.480]   And I believe for some of you in this room,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.280]   you need to rediscover your voice.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.120]   You need to rediscover your cry.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.040]   You need to draw a line in the sand and say,
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.440]   enough is enough.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.600]   I'm gonna stand up.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.640]   I'm gonna take a stand.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.560]   I'm gonna ask God.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560]   I'm not gonna suppress it.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.520]   Yes, maybe I haven't seen the freedom.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.560]   Yes, maybe it seems like God has been distant.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.560]   Yes, maybe the promise hasn't come through.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.240]   It feels like God hasn't answered.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.520]   He hasn't seen, but I will not silence my voice of hope.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.520]   I will not silence my voice of prayer.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.080]   I will not give in to the reality of my sin,
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.760]   but I will take a stand and say, enough is enough.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.960]   I will cry out.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:53.560]   Some of you need to start crying out again.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:59.040]   And we can see in the text here
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.680]   that Israel has remembered their God.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.880]   The question in the text though
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.600]   is has God remembered them?
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.560]   Is God present with his people when they cry out?
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.080]   Does God draw near to us when we have a voice
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.400]   in our soul that says, I want more freedom?
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.880]   I want you to see what happens in the text.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.360]   Just a very small thing that Moses writes here.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.200]   He says, the king has died.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.880]   The Israelites groaned in their slave and cried out,
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.880]   and their cry for help because of their slavery
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.640]   went up to God.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.720]   This was not some random cry.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.200]   This was not just lots of words in a vacuum.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.840]   These words went up to God,
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.160]   and this is the first introduction
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.600]   to a personal reality of God.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.560]   God's been mentioned in the Exodus so far,
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.640]   but this is the first time where God is about to step in
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.360]   and actually introduce himself, show us who he is.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   And like we say, next week we're gonna see
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.200]   the personal intimacy of that God
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.680]   as he meets Moses in Midian,
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.040]   but in this moment, God begins to express himself
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.280]   through his heart, through his soul,
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.440]   through his character, through his emotions,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.560]   through who he is, and mostly through his promise
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.040]   and his promise for his people.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.920]   And it's this idea of God's character
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.560]   that is now going to define the rest of the Exodus journey.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.040]   In fact, from this point forward,
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.680]   all the way through the next 38 chapters or so,
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.840]   God always refers back to this moment right here.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.680]   He always comes back and says, this is who I am.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.920]   I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.720]   I am this, I am that.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.160]   You need to know my character.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.240]   You need to know my heart,
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.280]   because you are a people who are shaped by my character.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.720]   And when we're shaped by the character of God,
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.880]   God's promises become our promises.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.240]   God's word becomes our word.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.720]   God's work and mission becomes our mission.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.200]   When he says, pray that heaven will come to earth,
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.000]   God was looking at the church.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.400]   And we align ourselves to the character of God.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.840]   That's the thing that enables us
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.480]   to journey into freedom from our Exodus.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.840]   And we're gonna see a lot of that as we go,
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.960]   but today I wanna open up this idea
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.800]   of the character of God with you.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.880]   I want you to see why God acts on behalf of his people.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.760]   What is it inside of him?
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.360]   What is it about his compassion
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.280]   that drives him to respond on behalf of his people?
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.200]   When we were in Egypt, that was a question
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.280]   that was going around my mind
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.440]   whilst we were filming this series.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.200]   I was always asking myself, what was it?
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.680]   What was it in God's heart?
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.560]   What was it that caused God
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.520]   to wanna have this response for his people?
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.240]   What makes God fight the battles
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.880]   that he fights for his people?
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.840]   And as we were there, we had a chance to connect
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.240]   with somebody in Egypt.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.440]   His name's Akram.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.440]   He's an NGO worker.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.000]   He runs an organization called Better for Kids.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.240]   And he works with orphans in Egypt.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.760]   And I wanted to sit down with him
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.520]   and find out a little bit more about his heart
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.840]   and why he serves and why he does what he does
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.160]   on behalf of others,
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.160]   hoping that I might encounter something
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.440]   about God's heart in what he does.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.680]   And so I sat down with him.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.960]   We did an interview.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.360]   We're gonna play that for you now.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.200]   I wanna just encourage you though to lean into this,
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.120]   to really open your ears of both your heart
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.040]   and your head to hear this.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.960]   Akram's English is not the strongest English.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.400]   And so you do need to kind of just listen in.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.480]   But he's got some incredible nuggets
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.640]   for us to understand about the heart of God in compassion.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.680]   Let's check this out.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.800]   I've come here to the bustling city of Cairo today
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.880]   to the local offices of an NGO
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.040]   called Better for Kids International
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.160]   to meet with one of their staff called Akram
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.640]   and find out a little bit more about the work they do.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.200]   But even more importantly,
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   to discover the central element
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.440]   to the start of the Exodus narrative.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:52.080]   Akram. - Hi, Andrew.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.400]   - Nice to meet you. - How are you?
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.520]   - I'm well, thank you. - Are you okay?
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.560]   - Yes, really good. - Have a seat, please.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.600]   Thank you so much.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.400]   It's such a pleasure to meet you today.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.320]   - Thank you. - Yes.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.680]   - Thank you, you're welcome.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.600]   - Well, thanks so much for spending some time with us today.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   Why don't we start by you introducing yourself?
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.640]   Tell us a little bit about who you are,
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.280]   your family, what you do.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.320]   - My name is Akram.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.200]   And I have 45 years.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.040]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.000]   Since 2015, you've been working for an organization
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.600]   called Better for Kids International, I believe.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.440]   - Yes.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.840]   - Can you tell us a little bit about
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.560]   the work you're specifically doing
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.400]   with the orphans that you're working with?
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.840]   - Yes, since 2015, I worked with a mission.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.120]   It's called Better for Kids.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.480]   In here in Egypt, a mission, Egyptian mission.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.360]   You can say that.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.200]   And I'm here in Egypt.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.040]   - For orphans.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.160]   - For orphans, yes.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.560]   It's called Good Samaritan.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.120]   Good Samaritan Orphans.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:58.120]   We have 40 kids, boy and girls,
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.040]   different age, since two years or one years,
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.920]   till married.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.720]   - Tell us about where the children are from
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.360]   that you're working with, that you're serving.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.800]   What sort of background do these children have?
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.640]   - Okay, we serve through the church,
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.960]   at the poor area.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.120]   Not directly with the family, but through the church.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:27.120]   So the church tell us about the poor family and the kids,
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.160]   and we go directly to the church
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:37.160]   and serve with the kids before the school.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.240]   The age from three years or two years
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.840]   till six or seven years.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.280]   - Right, right.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.240]   - We make an education curriculum.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.080]   - Yes.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.480]   - A, B, C, D, and alphabet, or something like that.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.320]   - Yeah.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.720]   - And curriculum for the Bible study.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.600]   I love the kids.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.160]   All of my life I serve the adults.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.680]   I sing with the adults.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.840]   I give the training with the adults.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.920]   But my heart with the kids.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.040]   The wonderful time and the best time
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   I spend during the week with my Sunday school,
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.760]   with seven or 10 kids in my class.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.800]   - And so it's the kids and it's their situation,
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.760]   it's their, the background,
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.920]   and maybe the poverty they've experienced
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.680]   that does something in your heart.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.320]   - Yes.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.240]   The need.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.080]   - The need they have.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:31.920]   - Yes.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.120]   I search all the time what the kids need.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.200]   So I can see the kids for this situation,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.400]   for this background, for our family,
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.640]   for the area that's very poor.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.760]   He can find anything easily.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:55.720]   So my heart, the kids' needs,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.520]   need the first for the love.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.520]   Love without anything.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.720]   I love you, just I love you.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.880]   Without anything.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:10.760]   And really, my heart can reach for the kids directly.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:16.040]   So I like to work with the kids
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.640]   'cause if the kids don't care for you, it's okay.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.480]   - Yeah.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   - But if you found really love for your heart,
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.320]   he come for you.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:33.720]   If you punish him or if you make anything,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.960]   but still he love you.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.440]   - Because you love the first
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.920]   and you have a really love for the kids.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.440]   - So your love really motivates
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.920]   your desire to help them as well.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.280]   - Yes, yes.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.880]   - When you can't help a kid,
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.840]   how does that feel for you personally?
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.320]   Is it frustrating?
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.440]   Are you upset?
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.080]   How do you handle the emotions when you can't help a kid?
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.080]   - Many time I cry with the kids.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.280]   (laughs)
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.080]   When I pray with them, yes.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.920]   When I speak with the kids
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.240]   and he explain what's actually happened with him.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.080]   - Yeah.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.520]   - Because many time I found kids,
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.800]   his dad or mom punish him in the hand.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.560]   - Hurt him?
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.400]   - Something like that, yes.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.240]   Something like that.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.080]   - Abuse.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.640]   - Abuse, yes.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.760]   I'm poor, I found some kids,
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.520]   her mom because he do something wrong,
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.760]   he bring the spoon and put it in the fire.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.920]   - Wow.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.720]   - And put for the hands.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:43.040]   At this time I didn't make my eyes
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   to cry with the kids
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.000]   'cause it's a very difficult situation.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.920]   - And that's your heart for them.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.000]   That's your compassion coming out of you.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.840]   - Yes.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.680]   - Emotionally.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.120]   - Yes, yes, yes, really.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.040]   - And that feeling in you,
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.120]   I'm assuming that that's what drives your response.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.280]   You act because your heart is broken.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.040]   - Yes, many time I pray for how can I help these kids?
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.040]   I want to bring this boy or girl with me at my home.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.240]   If I can't do that, okay, directly I will do that.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.960]   What's in here, we can do that.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.240]   Just pray for them.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.560]   - Pray for them, yeah.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.920]   You've mentioned a few times
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.120]   that one of the reasons why you do what you do
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.080]   is 'cause of your relationship with God.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:28.920]   - First.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.760]   - Yeah.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.600]   What is it about God that motivates you
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.840]   to serve these children?
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.360]   - Heart of Jesus for the kids.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.080]   You know the situation with Jesus
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.080]   when the children come to Jesus and serve Jesus,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.480]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't pray Jesus.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:54.440]   The different situation between heart Jesus for the kids
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.000]   and heart disciples for the kids.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.560]   Jesus look for the kids, it's a human,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.520]   not just the kids.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.040]   He's big.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.040]   So each time I read this chapter for the Bible
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:20.080]   about the heart of Jesus through the kids,
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.560]   I thank God for, I pray each time,
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.560]   give me little part for your heart to serve the kids.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.120]   - I think what we see in that story
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.640]   is Jesus' compassion for those kids.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.800]   And so you pray for just a little bit
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.760]   of that compassion yourself for the kids.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.480]   - Yes, really, really.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.280]   - And that compassion has really defined
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.320]   your whole ministry, your whole life.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.480]   - Really, I do that.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.480]   The Bible used the expression as Jesus is very big, angry.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.560]   Two time, it's the same expression.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.480]   The Bible, the New Testament use it for the Jesus.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.640]   The first time, the first time,
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.000]   this is the second time with the kids.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   The first time when the Jesus come to the temple.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.160]   - Temple, yes.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.320]   - Yeah, and he say that many people
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.960]   pray and say something, yeah.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.960]   The same expression, Jesus is very angry.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.480]   I can't remember what the expression in English actually,
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.920]   but in Arabic, the same words,
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.160]   the same letters for the words for the Jesus
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.760]   for all of the New Testament.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.040]   - Wow.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.120]   So the anger Jesus has in the temple,
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.920]   in John chapter two, I think.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.760]   - Yes, yes.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.560]   - It's the same anger he has against the disciples
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.080]   for stopping them coming to the kids.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.160]   I never knew that in Arabic.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.280]   That's beautiful.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.680]   - The same words, the same letters, and wow.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.000]   - Wow.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.680]   - He be angry for the 12 men,
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.440]   is very nearest for the Jesus.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.520]   - Yeah.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.560]   - And at the same, equal from,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.400]   he say that the men pray something at the temple.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   - Yeah, wow.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.240]   Wow.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.560]   So that drives what you do.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.400]   - Yes.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.600]   - That same kind of,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.240]   like, 'cause I think what you're talking about
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.600]   is compassion comes with two elements to it.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.000]   It comes with the love.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.520]   There's this love that drives compassion.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.040]   But also, like in that example you just shared
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.320]   on the Bible story, it comes with a certain sense of anger,
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.920]   like a righteous anger.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.720]   And both the love and the anger can actually form
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.880]   the compassion that we have to act in the way that we do.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.520]   Well, thank you so much for spending so much time with us
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.400]   and telling us about the work you do,
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.520]   but also more importantly, perhaps, the heart you have
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.120]   to serve the vulnerable children that you're working with.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:48.960]   All the best.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.040]   - Thank you.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.880]   Thank you.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.440]   - I think it's really quite profound
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.920]   what Akram opened up for me,
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.120]   looking at the Arabic words there for that anger.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.560]   And it really is so true that God's compassion
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   has this dual element to it, love and justice,
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.200]   mercy and the righting of wrongs.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.360]   And those two things come together to create
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.160]   the holistic way that God is compassionate.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.440]   And it's that that we see now
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.360]   as we open up this part of the story.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.240]   I wanna show you just very briefly here
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.920]   some of the ways in which we see this compassion at work.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.160]   It says here from verse 24,
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.640]   "God heard their groaning,
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.960]   "and he remembered his covenant with Abraham,
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.360]   "Isaac and with Jacob.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.440]   "So God looked on the Israelites
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.120]   "and was concerned about them."
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.440]   This is just, interestingly,
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.880]   this is just 15 words in Hebrew, those two verses.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.040]   They're just 15 words in Hebrew.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.120]   Four of those words is the word God, Elohim.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.120]   God would later show himself as the I am that I am Yahweh,
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.560]   who we've become to be known.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.240]   In this moment, though, he's just Elohim, God.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.760]   And God, I'm gonna draw on this.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.480]   Can everybody see this?
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.800]   Everybody okay?
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.360]   So I'm gonna draw God.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.520]   There you go.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.480]   You're welcome.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.040]   It says here four times God something,
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.520]   God something, God something, God something.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.440]   So first of all, it's God hears.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.280]   Then it says God remembers.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.640]   Then it says God sees.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:23.040]   And finally, it says God knows.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.320]   This is what the Hebrew basically tells us
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.200]   to help us to understand the heart of God for his people.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.760]   He is a God who hears, a God who remembers,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.200]   a God who sees, and a God who knows.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.240]   It says, first of all, that he hears their groaning.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.960]   Now, this is really important.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.520]   The word in Hebrew here means basically
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.320]   not just to listen, not just to hear something,
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.200]   but to actually act on what is being heard.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.680]   In other words, in the Hebrew,
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.040]   to understand how God hears,
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.120]   it's not just to think that God has kind of like
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.880]   heard my prayer, but it's actually that God
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.080]   is gonna respond and act on what he's heard.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:30:59.920]   Give you an example.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.680]   It's like my daughter Mia.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.360]   Now, I say to my daughter Mia every morning,
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.040]   make your bed.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.360]   Pretty much every day I come home after work
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.640]   and the bed is not made.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.800]   And I know that she heard me, but she didn't hear me.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.120]   Are you with me?
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.600]   Did you get that, right?
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.440]   'Cause if she had really heard me,
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.240]   she would have made the bed, right?
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.600]   Okay, that's the same sort of thing here.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.920]   God is hearing in the sense that
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.560]   he doesn't just receive some sound,
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.040]   but he's actually going to respond.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.800]   He's actually going to act.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.840]   And it's interesting.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.180]   Here's what he's heard.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.760]   Not the crying, shouting, loud stuff,
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.400]   as important as that was.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.660]   He hears their groaning.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.120]   In other words, what he hears is their personal,
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.000]   oh man, this is hard.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.200]   You need to know here that that's your God.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.280]   That sure, he comes and fights for the injustices
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.120]   of this world.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.920]   Sure, he comes and does great, amazing things.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.680]   He parts seas, he's a fire on top of a mountain.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.520]   He's all those things.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.040]   But you need to know first and foremost,
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.680]   he's a personal, intimate God for you.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.200]   He hears your groans, those private, personal things
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.120]   that no one else hears or even knows.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:18.080]   Those internal, oh man, if only I could be free.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.920]   Those are the things that he hears.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.420]   And then it says that he remembers.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.920]   Now this word for remember is zakar in the Hebrew.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.120]   It doesn't mean that God has forgotten.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.520]   I know when we hear this in the English,
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.520]   it's very easy for us to think
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.320]   that remembering means forgetting.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.880]   It's not saying that God has forgotten his people
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.480]   and that in their crying out, he's gone like,
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.200]   oh yeah, they're in slavery.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.880]   Totally forgot.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.200]   It's not meaning that.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.240]   What it actually means is that when God remembers,
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.800]   the Hebrew word basically means to commit to a promise,
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.280]   to commit to something that you have promised to do.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.740]   So where hearing comes with an action,
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.400]   the action is this remembering of the covenant,
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.000]   the covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.980]   God remembers means that he is going to stay committed
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.120]   to the promise that he's made.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.520]   Give an example in Chris and I's life.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.080]   We got married 25 years ago.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.520]   And when we got married, I said some vows.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.760]   We said some vows to each other.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   And part of our vows to each other was
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.720]   we would not sleep with anybody else.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.880]   We would not have an affair.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.240]   We would stay committed to each other.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.840]   And that's the way things are gonna be.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.320]   We made those vows to one another.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.280]   We made those vows to God.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:36.040]   I, after 25 years, have remembered those vows,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.160]   not because I forget them here and there,
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.240]   but because I've remained faithful to her for 25 years.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.060]   Do you see that?
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.160]   That's remembering the vows.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.760]   That's me standing and saying,
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.320]   I made a commitment to this woman
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.920]   and I'm gonna stand by with her and alongside of her.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.760]   And she's done the same for me, I think.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.600]   Yes, you have.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.420]   Good.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.260]   She's done the same.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.000]   For me.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.720]   So she has remembered the covenant.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.160]   I've remembered the covenant we've made.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.880]   And by remembering, what that means is,
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.000]   not that we've forgotten, it's that we're living it out.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.640]   We're committing to that priority.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.880]   We're committing to that promise.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.160]   When God says he remembers his covenant with Israel,
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.640]   he's saying, I haven't given up.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.120]   I haven't stepped away from that.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.560]   I'm still committed to that promise.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.320]   Genesis 12 is the heart of that promise
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.960]   where God shows up to Abraham and he says,
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.840]   I'm gonna take you and I'm gonna bless you.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.000]   I'm gonna make your name great.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.100]   I'm gonna make the nation great.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.480]   And all nations are gonna be blessed through you.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.800]   God comes in the Exodus and says,
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.680]   I haven't given up on that.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.120]   I am still that person.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.200]   I'm still that God.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.260]   That's still my promise.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.040]   And I'm working that promise through even to this day.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.080]   So when you think I'm distant, I'm not.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.360]   When you think I haven't answered, I'm still at work.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.720]   I'm a God who remembers.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.240]   I'm committed to you.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.640]   And I will prove my faithfulness and my commitment to you.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.440]   And he does this by seeing them.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.880]   He then looks upon them.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.400]   That word is the word that we've looked at
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.280]   over the last couple of weeks.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.600]   It's the word Rahah.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.000]   It's the same word that Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.200]   when she saw Moses in the reeds, she Rahad him.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.320]   It means to see with emotion.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   It's this idea of compassion.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.640]   It's this idea of something changing inside of our hearts
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.760]   and that change causing us to wanna be different,
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.200]   causing us to act in a different way.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.480]   This is the same thing that Moses had
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.240]   when he saw his own people under slavery and he Rahad.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.280]   He saw them with emotion, this compassion.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.320]   This is what Akram was talking about in the film.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:33.000]   And it's so important that you see before God does anything
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.720]   that he hears, he remembers, and then he has this compassion.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.400]   He sees the people for who they truly are
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.760]   and he sees them with this idea of justice and love,
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.560]   this idea of mercy and righting wrong.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.720]   And because he sees them, he's going to go
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.040]   and do all the things that he does in the Exodus.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   And so often, God will refer back to this
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.880]   in the chapters ahead.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.560]   I see you, I see you, I see you.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.120]   And what's key to grab ahold of here
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   is something that I think is very important
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.400]   'cause we forget this a lot.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   You see, God does not act against the evil
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.320]   or the sin of Egypt.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:20.160]   He primarily acts on behalf of the freedom of his people.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.440]   Now, it's really important you get this.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.440]   See, compassion, not judgment, is the fuel to Exodus.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.440]   Now, did the sin need to be judged?
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.160]   Does our sin need to be judged
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   and dealt with with the Lord?
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.120]   Of course it does, but you need to understand
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.760]   that the starting point is not an angry God
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.840]   who has wrath in his heart against his sinful people
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.320]   and he wants to judge them.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.880]   The starting part is he looks upon us, he sees us,
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.040]   he has compassion with us, he has grace and he has mercy
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:48.880]   and he has love.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.760]   And just like Akram sees those kids
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.700]   and he sees all the things happening in their lives,
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.840]   but he's first motivated by love,
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.320]   a love that he's found in God.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.400]   So God sees, which means compassion
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.860]   is always the driving force of why God comes
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.880]   and judges sin.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.560]   It's because he wants to see us free.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.560]   It's because he loves us.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.420]   And there is mercy and justice.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.320]   There is love and the righting of wrongs.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.840]   And those two things come together.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.440]   And the heart of it is all this idea of love, compassion.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.840]   Some of you, some of us, 'cause I do this too,
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.280]   some of us, we stay in our sin
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.640]   because we're afraid of the anger of God against us.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.440]   And we don't deal with it and we kind of live in it
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.000]   and we think God's angry at us, God's upset at us,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.760]   God must be so angry at me.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.000]   Oh man, he knows all the brokenness in my life
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.700]   and he can't like me.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.800]   God's not gonna do anything for me.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.760]   Now the danger of that is it becomes a cycle
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.560]   'cause then we think we have to try to earn God's love.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.240]   We have to try to make him happy with us,
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.720]   try to appease him.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.080]   All of that goes out the window when we realize
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.120]   that it is compassion that turns the heart of God to us.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.960]   Not his anger, not his wrath, not all of that.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.200]   It's his compassion.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.320]   He looks on us with love and in his love,
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.440]   we are able to love 'cause he first loved us.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.000]   He sees you.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.340]   And that should set some of you free here
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.560]   to actually deal with some of the sin
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.040]   that you need to be dealing with.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.560]   Knowing that God is not some wrathful, angry guy
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.840]   who wants to smite you.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.960]   He's a father who runs in the field towards you,
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.320]   puts a robe on you and a ring on your finger
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.000]   and sandals on your feet and he says,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.680]   "You're not gonna be one of my slaves,
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.840]   "you're my son, my daughter, my child
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.360]   "and we're gonna do this together."
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.600]   So he sees and then finally it says that he knows.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.720]   I love this.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.040]   He knows.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.360]   The Hebrew word literally means
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.000]   that he understands everything about everything.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.800]   It's this biblical sense of intimacy
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.400]   and knowing something fully and completely.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.880]   And I want you to get this.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.200]   God knows everything about you
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.160]   and he has not turned his back on you.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.040]   God knows all of your sin and brokenness
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.780]   and it does not offend him.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.080]   Sin hurts him, sin upsets him,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.680]   sin he needs to deal with absolutely.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.120]   But he knows the intimate details of your life
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   that no one else knows.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.840]   The stuff that you would never have the courage
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.640]   to share with anybody, he knows that
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.460]   and he still loves you.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:25.680]   So this security comes in knowing a God
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.800]   who knows us completely and still accepts us
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.640]   and embraces us.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.340]   He hears us, he remembers his covenant,
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.740]   he sees with compassion, he leads with compassion
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.460]   and he knows us completely.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:41.460]   And because of all of that, that is the God of Exodus.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.180]   That's the God who reveals himself to his people.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.300]   That's the God who says, "Before I do anything,
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.900]   "you need to know who I am."
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.660]   And if I was to kind of summarize it
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.500]   in ways in which you can easily remember, here it is.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.380]   He is basically declaring that he is close.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.460]   He hears.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.720]   He's not distant, he hasn't given up on you.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.120]   He's close to you.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.720]   What he's also saying is that he's committed to you.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.700]   He's committed to you.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.420]   He's walking with you.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.840]   He's right here, right now, fighting battles for you.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.520]   He has not given up on you.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.060]   He remembers his covenant.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.680]   He's committed.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.160]   He's compassionate over everything
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.280]   that's happening in your life,
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.720]   all the stuff that's going on,
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.120]   all the things that you thought he would be angry about
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.360]   or upset about, he loves you
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.100]   and in his love, he has mercy and justice.
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.500]   He wants to be with you.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.860]   He is compassionate.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.500]   And then finally, of course, he is concerned
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.800]   because he knows you and he's concerned
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.580]   about the brokenness and the sin
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.220]   and what that does to you
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.460]   and his concern drives him to want to respond.
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.620]   He is close, he is committed, he is compassionate,
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:49.720]   he is concerned.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.260]   That's the God of Exodus.
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:56.700]   And that needs to be our framework that we have
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.340]   as we step towards the burning bush next week.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.140]   This is how God introduces himself
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:06.680]   to all of his people in their slavery to sin.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.900]   And this, my friends, if you remember this,
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.820]   if this becomes how you see God,
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.920]   you will actually have the courage to cry out
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:21.360]   and see the coming of a promise in your life.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.780]   May that fill you with joy as you take the serious steps
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.300]   to no longer ignore the realities
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.060]   of what is happening in your life
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.180]   and stand before a God who hears, remembers, sees, and knows
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.740]   and allow him to set you free.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.680]   Can I pray for you?
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.740]   When you're with me, stand with me and I'm gonna pray.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:48.180]   Father, we are standing before you today as your people
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:52.420]   in the same way that Israel stood before you
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.260]   and groaned and cried out.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.460]   And Lord, for those of us in this room
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.100]   who have silenced our voice,
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:06.460]   so those of us in this room who have silenced
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.580]   our cry of our soul for freedom,
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.480]   Father, I pray that you would come by your spirit
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.340]   in this moment and just begin to rebirth and refresh
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.420]   and renew that desire within us.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:21.320]   Lord, you hear our groaning,
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.300]   those private, intimate,
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:30.220]   where we are expressing the depth of our pain,
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.360]   brokenness, you hear and you know.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.780]   God, you have not given up on us.
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.540]   Every person here, you remember your covenant
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.140]   that you have with them, the new covenant
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.040]   that is in the blood of Christ Jesus,
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:48.080]   saved, redeemed, sanctified, being made new in him,
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.960]   a new creation as Paul would talk about it.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.580]   God looks at you and he remembers the blood
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.060]   that was shed on the cross of Calvary
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.180]   and he sees you through that blood.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:01.820]   He sees you and he loves you.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.860]   God knows everything about you
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.060]   and because he knows everything about you,
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.100]   there is nothing you need to hide from him.
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:13.520]   The enemy will want you to feel shame,
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.180]   but Adam and Eve were naked and unashamed.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.160]   And I pray that as you find your cry again,
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:25.640]   I pray that as you recognize God is hearing you,
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.400]   remembers you and sees you,
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.440]   I pray you will find yourself unashamed before him.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.580]   You will find yourself with a cry in your heart
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.200]   that says, do whatever it takes, Lord.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.620]   That you would come and realize
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.220]   that those promises do stand,
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.740]   that he is faithful and he is at work.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.160]   And I pray that this would be a God.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:53.320]   This would be your God.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:57.120]   This would be the one that you would worship.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.360]   Now, whenever the enemy would come
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.420]   to try to tell you differently,
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.700]   God is like this, no, God is not like that,
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.780]   just like he did to Adam and Eve in the garden,
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.620]   you would say, no, no, I stand on what the scriptures say.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:12.500]   I stand on a God who hears, remembers, sees and knows.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.500]   That's my God.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.200]   Father, I pray that that would set us free.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.200]   And we thank you for this, in Jesus' name.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.040]   Amen.
