1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
 All right, church, we move into the portion of our service where we're going to hear the

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,420
 word.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,080
 We are starting a brand new series this week called Parables.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,000
 We're going to be looking at these stories that Jesus told, and kicking this off will

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 be Pastor Ellison.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,960
 Pastor Ellison, come on up here.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,140
 I just want to show the church, I want to clarify.

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,040
 I woke up first this morning because I have a newborn.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,360
 I put this on first.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,320
 I just, I want to be...

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,880
 No, no, this is what friends do, right?

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,880
 We match.

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,360
 And actually, Michelle is also wearing the same thing, so maybe it's a pastoral team

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
 thing.

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
 All right, we're going to pray one more time because we're a church.

16
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
 You can never have enough praying.

17
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
 Go ahead and stretch out your arms to Ellison.

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,360
 We're just going to pray for him.

19
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,280
 Father, we thank you this morning for Ellison, for this man of God, and for the word that

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,960
 you've put on his heart for the study.

21
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,680
 And just, God, that you would be with him as he speaks.

22
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,440
 God, give him your spirit to lead and guide him.

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,000
 God, we pray for us.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,160
 We pray for our hearts to be open to hearing from you, God, and we give you glory for what

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,720
 you're about to do in this sermon.

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
 So, in your name we pray.

27
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
 Amen.

28
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
 Amen.

29
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,480
 I promise I didn't tell you, him and I are also remaking Rush Hour 4 soon, so that's

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,440
 what's really going on, okay?

31
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,960
 Well, good morning.

32
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,320
 It's good to be here, as always, and an honor to start a new sermon series together.

33
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,800
 I want to tell you a story, another story, before we start.

34
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,000
 So before I became, joined Full-Time Ministry, I used to be a kindergarten teacher.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,680
 And so as a kindergarten teacher, of course, we told a lot of stories, story time, circle

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,120
 time with our children.

37
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,800
 And so I'm going to tell you one of the favorite stories I used to share with my kindergarten

38
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
 class, okay?

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,200
 It's called "Tadpole's Promise."

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,280
 All right, so crisscross applesauce, if everyone's sitting comfortably, I'm going to tell you

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,040
 a story.

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,160
 Once upon a time, on the edge of a beautiful pond, where the willow met the bay, lived

43
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,620
 a beautiful tadpole and a caterpillar.

44
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,120
 They were best friends, the tadpole and the caterpillar, and were deeply in love with

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,800
 each other.

46
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,440
 The tadpole would call the caterpillar his beautiful rainbow, and the caterpillar would

47
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,520
 call the tadpole her beautiful black pearl.

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,480
 "I love everything about you," the caterpillar would say to the tadpole.

49
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,800
 "You are my beautiful black pearl.

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
 Promise me you'll never, ever change."

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And the tadpole said, "I promise, I promise you that I will never change."

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,200
 But the next time they met, the tadpole had grown two little legs, and the caterpillar

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
 was heartbroken.

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,220
 "You broke your promise to me, tadpole.

55
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,440
 You said you would never change, but now you have legs."

56
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,800
 And the tadpole said to the caterpillar, "I'm sorry, I don't want these legs at all.

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,720
 All I want is my beautiful rainbow."

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,760
 And so the caterpillar said, "Okay, I'll forgive you, but promise me you will not change

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,160
 anymore."

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,440
 And the tadpole, "I promise, I promise you I will not change."

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,440
 But sure enough, the next time they met, the tadpole changed again.

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,560
 He had arms, then he had lost his tail, and each time he would make a promise not to change,

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,080
 he could never keep his promise.

64
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,300
 He kept on changing.

65
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,760
 And so in the end, the caterpillar said to him, "You have broken my heart too many times,

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
 tadpole.

67
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,960
 You are not my shiny black pearl anymore."

68
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,920
 The tadpole thought to himself, "But you will always be my beautiful rainbow.

69
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,360
 I'm sorry, you've changed too much.

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,520
 I never want to see you again."

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,600
 And with that, the caterpillar crawled up onto the highest branch she could find, and

72
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,560
 she cried and cried.

73
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,880
 She cried so hard and so long that she formed a cocoon around her and fell asleep for a

74
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,920
 very long time.

75
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,960
 Now some time passed, and when the caterpillar woke up, everything had changed.

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,400
 She was now a butterfly with beautiful wings.

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,680
 The season had changed.

78
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
 The sun was shining.

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,880
 The grass was green.

80
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,260
 The flowers had bloomed.

81
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,260
 But what didn't change was what she had in her heart for her shiny black pearl.

82
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,040
 And so she decided to fly down to the river to find him and to forgive him.

83
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,520
 And as she flew down to the river, a frog was sitting on the lily pad.

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,360
 "Excuse me, Mr. Frog, have you seen my..."

85
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,680
 But before she could say "beautiful black pearl," the frog jumped up and ate up the

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,440
 butterfly in one big gulp.

87
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:34,200
 Emotional damage, wow.

88
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,220
 What a story.

89
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,220
 I'm sorry.

90
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,220
 I'm sorry.

91
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
 Yeah.

92
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,940
 But what a story, right?

93
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,700
 In those two minutes, we went on a rollercoaster of emotions.

94
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
 You guys were listening.

95
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,440
 There was love, friendship, cuteness, heartbreak, shock, and horror.

96
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
 You were drawn in.

97
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,380
 You were listening to the story.

98
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,380
 Why?

99
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,680
 Because stories carry power.

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,100
 Stories are powerful, which is often why when people want to teach something or explain

101
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,060
 something, they do so through stories.

102
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,300
 We have not just this story, fairy tales, countless fairy tales.

103
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,860
 These cute little stories would often have a deeper meaning behind them.

104
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,660
 And Jesus knew this.

105
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,940
 In fact, a lot of how Jesus taught, Jesus chose to teach through stories because he

106
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,840
 knew they had power.

107
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,580
 And the stories Jesus told are known as parables.

108
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,840
 And if you read through the gospels in the Matthew, Mark, and Luke, Jesus taught through

109
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,340
 these parables to draw people in, to get them invested, but to make them think about truths,

110
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,680
 truths about his message, truths about the kingdom of heaven, and to declare him who

111
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,580
 he was and the character of God.

112
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,540
 These parables, as people heard them, invited hearers into a new reality that Jesus was

113
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:08,520
 trying to open their eyes to, the fact that the kingdom of heaven is surely but slowly

114
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,860
 taking over this earth.

115
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,540
 But the difference is that Jesus' stories weren't just supposed to be like cute little

116
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,220
 tales that he told with a little moral truth.

117
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,180
 They were actually meant to shock and to shake our world.

118
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,700
 In fact, one of the reasons why Jesus had to use parables to teach was because some

119
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,980
 of the things he was talking about were so countercultural, so shocking, and so different

120
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,300
 from what other people were saying that if he had said it directly, people would have

121
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,580
 arrested him straight away.

122
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,940
 Which is why people told, Jesus told parables and stories.

123
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:50,260
 But then it's also why then he had to explain them, tell them what is this story really

124
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,060
 about, again, because they were so powerful and so dangerous.

125
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,060
 He had to veil them with a story, but then he would go on and explain the truth of them.

126
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,820
 And these stories, even though they're over 2,000 years old, still ring true today.

127
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,540
 So like Promise told us earlier, over the next four weeks, we're going to look at some

128
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,460
 of these beloved stories of Jesus.

129
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,620
 And together we're going to study them, we're going to wrestle with them, and we're going

130
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,620
 to ask ourselves how these ancient stories continue to speak truth into our life and

131
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,820
 our journey with Jesus today.

132
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,860
 It's going to be good, I really hope so.

133
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,180
 And today we're going to start with the parable of the sower.

134
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,820
 The parable of the sower.

135
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,580
 Now do you guys remember what chia pets were?

136
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,660
 Are they still around?

137
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
 Chia pets, right?

138
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,740
 Chia pets were like these potato-looking lump, okay, that you soak them in some water and

139
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,460
 you water them and then you put them against a windowsill.

140
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,300
 Or maybe that's the first science experiment, some of you guys did get that little seed,

141
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,660
 right, and put it in the cotton, and then sure enough, after some time, the seed sprout

142
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:03,220
 or the chia seed grows green hair and that's how they grow, that's how things work, right?

143
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,220
 Seeds are meant to bear fruit.

144
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,740
 Seeds grow, that's what they're supposed to do.

145
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:16,700
 In fact, it's all in a part of God's design of how he created this world to work.

146
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:22,340
 On the third day of creation, God said, "Let the land produce vegetation, seed-bearing

147
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:29,420
 plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it according to the various kinds."

148
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,380
 So seeds are supposed to grow, seeds are supposed to bear fruit.

149
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:40,380
 But in order for seeds to grow and to bear fruit, they need good soil.

150
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,220
 In fact, you could even say that soil and fruit-bearing seeds are essential for our

151
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,620
 survival as humans on this earth.

152
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,400
 Maybe it's not something we think about all the time, but next time you go into a supermarket

153
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,820
 or something, you're at a parking shop or welcome or whatever, take a look at all the

154
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,900
 products, right, or when you go to the wet market.

155
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,420
 There's fruits, there's vegetables, now they're all neatly laid in front of us, you know,

156
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,620
 we can just go and buy them and bring them home and prepare our meals and stuff.

157
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,540
 But think a bit further sometimes.

158
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,540
 Where did this stuff come from?

159
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,660
 The shelves that are fully well-stacked with products, it's easy to forget that all this

160
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,980
 is actually a produce of farming, of agriculture, where seeds had to be planted, were sown into

161
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,780
 soil and then these seeds bear fruit that becomes our food, or it's the food our food

162
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,260
 eats sometimes, right?

163
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:36,740
 The entire world is reliant on seed and good soil.

164
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,740
 In fact, I wrote a little poem, a little haiku, okay, to describe this.

165
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,780
 Listen, if the soil is bad, the seeds do not bear us food.

166
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
 Without food, we die.

167
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,140
 All right, it's to the point, shortened to the point.

168
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,500
 Thank you, thank you.

169
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,300
 Now, like I said, for us, you know, we're a bit detached from this reality, but the

170
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,340
 realities and difficulties in agriculture were a lot more obvious for the people in

171
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,500
 Jesus' time.

172
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,820
 They would have understood immediately the importance of good farming and seeds that

173
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:19,080
 produce a fruit, which is perhaps why often Jesus used farming and agriculture as a way

174
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,180
 to illustrate his point, right?

175
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,820
 Seeds and conditions of soil and what bears fruit, what doesn't bear fruit.

176
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,220
 And so this is the heart behind Jesus' parable.

177
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,940
 So we're about to read it and then after that, we're going to walk through the parable

178
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,300
 to learn what Jesus has to say about his kingdom through this story.

179
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,660
 It starts in Luke 8, verse 1.

180
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,540
 It says this, "After this, Jesus traveled from one town and village to another, proclaiming

181
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,380
 the good news of the kingdom of God.

182
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,220
 The twelve were with him, and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases.

183
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,540
 Mary called Magdalene, whom had seven demons had come out.

184
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,280
 Jonah, the wife of Huzah, the manager of Herod's household, Susanna, and many others.

185
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,800
 These women were helping to support them out of their own means.

186
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,460
 While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town,

187
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,500
 he told this parable.

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,960
 A farmer went out to sow a seed.

189
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,860
 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path.

190
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,920
 It was trampled on and birds ate it up.

191
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,900
 Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no

192
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,900
 moisture.

193
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,820
 Other seeds fell among thorns which grew up with it and choked the plants.

194
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,260
 Still, other seeds fell on good soil.

195
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:43,100
 It came up and yielded a crop a hundred times more than was sown."

196
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,260
 Now on the surface, it seems like a pretty straightforward story.

197
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,420
 A farmer goes out, does his thing, sows his seeds with various results.

198
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,900
 But when we think about it, when we look a bit deeper, there are some unusual elements

199
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,500
 to this story.

200
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,780
 Firstly, the method of planting seed, the method the farmer used, was a bit unusual.

201
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,020
 Normally care was taken to make sure that seed wasn't just scattered.

202
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,780
 The name for doing this in farming is called broadcasting.

203
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,580
 So normally, farmers wouldn't just scatter seed all over the place.

204
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,220
 But rather, usually, intention was taken to put seeds in a place where it had the best

205
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,620
 chance to grow.

206
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,760
 Remember also, Jesus started by saying, "I'm talking about the good news of the kingdom

207
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,160
 of God."

208
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,900
 So within this context, people were listening to this story thinking, "Well, what do seeds

209
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,020
 and birds and thorns and hard ground, all that kind of stuff, have to do?

210
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:46,020
 What does that have to do with God's kingdom?"

211
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,780
 Now here's what's important for us today.

212
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,500
 You have just heard this parable.

213
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,620
 You've heard the story, it's drawn you in.

214
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,120
 Maybe as I was reading, you had pictures of farmers throwing seed everywhere, pictures

215
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,800
 of seed landing in different types of ground.

216
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,060
 But with listening to what we're about to say, we're going to talk about the explanation.

217
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:13,580
 And so in listening to explanation, there is also going to come expectation and responsibility.

218
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,900
 This is why Jesus says, "Whoever has ears, let them hear."

219
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,700
 His disciples asked him what this parable meant.

220
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:28,180
 He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of kingdom of God has been given to you."

221
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:34,140
 And so we are going to look into these secrets of the kingdom of God, explanation that Jesus

222
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,140
 has given to us.

223
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,060
 We're about to get into the meaning of this parable.

224
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,660
 If you have ears today, you're about to hear.

225
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,180
 You're going to see and you're going to understand, hopefully, what Jesus is trying to teach us.

226
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,280
 Now but like I said, this comes with expectation and responsibility.

227
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:00,220
 But because you're about to hear, you're about to see and understand, this is going to change,

228
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,040
 it should change your world.

229
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,420
 Because we're talking about understanding God's heart and His kingdom.

230
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,220
 And it's going to challenge us to do something with the message, with the seed we're about

231
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,660
 to hear today.

232
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,020
 We're talking about revealing secrets of God's kingdom.

233
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:25,660
 Once you've seen, once you've heard, once you've understood, you have no excuse.

234
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,860
 And so what I'm saying right now is if you don't want that responsibility, maybe it's

235
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,300
 best for you can put in some air pods right now, okay?

236
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,340
 I won't even be offended if you go downstairs to PCC, grab a coffee or something.

237
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,260
 It's half-price coffee today, by the way, right?

238
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,300
 Because Hong Kong won the gold medal, right?

239
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,460
 So yeah, congratulations, Hong Kong.

240
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,560
 Amazing.

241
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,060
 But honestly, if you wanted to leave right now, I wouldn't be offended.

242
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,700
 But I hope you will stay.

243
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,780
 Because what I've said, through understanding these parables, we're going to get to know

244
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:05,520
 more about who Jesus is and how He's called us to live.

245
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,880
 And this is what being a follower of Jesus is all about, isn't it?

246
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,560
 This is what our lives should be about.

247
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,020
 So if you're ready, let's hear the explanation.

248
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,560
 Well, Jesus says it Himself.

249
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,520
 This is the meaning of the parable.

250
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,740
 The seed is the Word of God.

251
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,560
 The seed is the Word of God.

252
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
 So there's our first reveal.

253
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,800
 It seems that this is a teaching about how God's Word works in the different types of

254
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,520
 soil.

255
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
 Now notice this, though.

256
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,060
 The interesting thing is that throughout the story, the seed is the only consistent thing.

257
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,840
 The seed is consistent.

258
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,240
 The soil changes, but the seed never changes.

259
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,400
 As it says in Scripture, "The grass withers, the flowers fell, but the Word of God endures

260
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,480
 forever."

261
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,200
 Now the way the farmer is sowing the seed is through scattering.

262
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,060
 Like I said just now, scattering was an unusual practice because it was seen as wasteful.

263
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,960
 In a time where food was scarce and needed to be grown properly, you wouldn't want to

264
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,800
 waste your seed like that.

265
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,280
 The seed was a precious commodity for the farmer.

266
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,520
 So the usual practice would be to make sure the seeds were put in places where they had

267
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,760
 potential for growth.

268
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,480
 So why the scattering of the seed?

269
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,720
 Why is Jesus telling the story this way?

270
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,520
 Well, I think what He's trying to tell us is this, that the scattering of seed—remember,

271
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,280
 the seed represents God's Word—the scattering of the seed highlights the fact that the Word

272
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,320
 of God is everywhere and for everyone.

273
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,960
 There is an unusual sense of generosity about how the farmer is scattering his seed.

274
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,800
 There's almost like a joy about it.

275
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,160
 You can almost picture him doing, "Yeah, I'm just going to spread it everywhere.

276
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,400
 It doesn't matter where it lands.

277
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,200
 My aim is to spread it as far and wide as I possibly can."

278
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,360
 He's not eking our living, being really stingy with the seed.

279
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,520
 He's not thinking about the seed running out because He knows there is more than enough.

280
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,940
 It will never run out.

281
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,360
 This is what Jesus is trying to say.

282
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,160
 He's trying to say that God's Word is abundant.

283
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,160
 And God's heart, His desire is for everyone to be able to encounter it, to be able to

284
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,760
 hear it.

285
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:30,240
 God's desire is that nobody shall perish, but everyone has a chance of hearing His Word.

286
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,600
 And what do we know about His Word?

287
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,840
 His Word is powerful.

288
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,120
 The seed carries with it the potential for growth.

289
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,180
 The potential of God's Word that we carry is also the truth of His love, His salvation,

290
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,520
 and the great potential to bear fruit.

291
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,720
 Disciples making more disciples.

292
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,760
 But see, this is what happens.

293
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,160
 What happens to the seed, though, depends on the condition of the soil it lands in.

294
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,720
 And there's a few different types of soil.

295
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,960
 The first one is this.

296
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,120
 "Those along the path are the ones who hear."

297
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,740
 And then the devil comes and takes away the Word from their hearts so that they may not

298
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,640
 believe and be saved.

299
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,320
 Okay, so this is the second reveal.

300
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,440
 The seed is God's Word, and the soil represents people and the condition of our hearts.

301
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,240
 And so for the seed that falls along the path, it tells us it's trampled on, and the devil

302
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,120
 snatches the Word away.

303
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,200
 This devil snatches the rest of the seeds away.

304
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,080
 It's important to notice, though, that these people have heard God's Word.

305
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,080
 It's not the hearing that they've heard God's Word.

306
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,400
 The problem is that they don't put their belief in God, and so they don't receive salvation.

307
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 They're not saved.

308
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,000
 They don't believe, therefore they're not saved.

309
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,360
 The heart that is hard, a hard heart, will never be able to receive God's Word.

310
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,480
 In addition to this, we have an enemy, like we said a couple of weeks ago, that is actively

311
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,980
 trying to stop the Word of God from taking root and bearing fruit in people's hearts.

312
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:17,280
 The enemy's aim is the complete opposite of what God is trying to do.

313
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,840
 Now again, notice, it's not God that stops the seed from taking root.

314
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,040
 It's the hardness of the path.

315
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,000
 It's the bird that snatches it away.

316
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,660
 And Jesus is not shy in telling us the consequences of a hardened heart.

317
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:38,240
 Because the heart is hard and does not believe, these people are not saved, so that they may

318
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,800
 not be saved, meaning they are not rescued and brought out of the consequences of sin

319
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,200
 and darkness.

320
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,960
 They do not have the life now and the eternal life that Jesus promises for those who follow

321
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
 them.

322
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,520
 Now, if you look back at the story of Luke, until this point, Jesus has actually met a

323
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,200
 bunch of people with hard hearts.

324
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,280
 People like the Pharisees and the religious leaders who refused to listen to Jesus.

325
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:12,600
 The villagers in his own hometown of Nazareth who drove Jesus out and even tried to throw

326
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,740
 him off a cliff and kill him.

327
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:24,440
 The hardened heart will always reject Jesus and the life and salvation only he can provide.

328
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,340
 So here's the question today as you're listening.

329
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,760
 Has your heart been hardened?

330
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:39,280
 Jesus tells us, "If you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."

331
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,160
 And one of the first things I want to say this morning is that for those of you who

332
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:49,480
 have heard God's word but not yet let it sink into your hearts, I really urge you today

333
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,080
 to really, really consider this question.

334
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,440
 Have you let the word of God sink into your hearts?

335
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,120
 Have you received it and not just heard it, but received it and started to put your belief

336
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,600
 in it?

337
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,600
 Because if you haven't, the consequences is literally one of eternal life with Jesus or

338
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,600
 eternal separation from him in darkness.

339
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 So that's the hard heart.

340
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,400
 But there's also those on the rocky ground.

341
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,760
 These are the ones that receive God's word with joy when they hear, but they have no

342
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
 root.

343
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,200
 They believe for a little while, but in the time of testing, they fall away.

344
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,200
 So the second group of people are called the rocky ground.

345
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,840
 Like we're saying, the seed will grow, but only if the conditions are right.

346
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,720
 And so in the same way, unless God's word actually takes root in your heart, it will

347
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,400
 not be long lasting.

348
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,560
 It's like getting a gym membership at the customer New Year, going for a few weeks and

349
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,160
 giving it up again.

350
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,560
 Or like the instrument that you swore you'd pick up and practice every day, but now the

351
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,320
 guitar just sits in the corner gathering dust and you don't know it's out of tune.

352
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,280
 You don't know what to do with it anymore.

353
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,480
 The same thing happens when it comes to our faith.

354
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,560
 Receiving God's word is an exciting moment.

355
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,360
 Maybe even getting baptized, that moment is so exciting.

356
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,600
 Think back to a time when you first put your faith in Jesus.

357
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,920
 Joy is such a perfect word to describe that moment.

358
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,880
 The hope that you felt, no troubles of this world have finally been lifted.

359
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,040
 Yes, I believe in Jesus now.

360
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
 Everything's going to be okay.

361
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
 I feel great.

362
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,640
 But then the adrenaline wears off and the moment passes and the reality of life starts to hit

363
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,120
 you again.

364
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,600
 You start to face struggle and testing and then your faith, you find sometimes, begins

365
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,200
 to shrink.

366
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,800
 This is a word for us in this room because there is a danger that this could be us.

367
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,480
 This could be us in this room today and we do not want to be in this category.

368
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,520
 Most of us in this room, the majority of us, have received God's word.

369
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,000
 We might not even have been believing in it for a while.

370
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,320
 The question is, has it taken root in your heart?

371
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:24,240
 Because if it has not, Jesus says, when testing comes, you will fall away and falling away

372
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,160
 from your faith is as though you never believed in the first place.

373
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,560
 The consequences of people in this category are the same as those with a hard heart.

374
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:42,920
 Now this perhaps is one of the most difficult truths about following Jesus.

375
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,920
 Following Jesus does not automatically make life easier.

376
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:54,920
 A relationship with Jesus is not a magic pill to take away life's problems.

377
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:02,600
 In fact, many times, believing in Jesus will bring testing into your life.

378
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,080
 And testing comes in different forms, right?

379
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,600
 Sometimes it comes from temptations, the desires of the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust

380
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,680
 of the eyes, the pride of life as Scripture describes it.

381
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,280
 And when these things come knocking on your door, when they come to test you, we give

382
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,000
 in when God's word hasn't fully taken root in our lives.

383
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:36,680
 Despite the moment of joy that we felt, the temptations overwhelm us and we fall away.

384
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,760
 Sometimes though, this testing is even orchestrated by God.

385
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,800
 Scripture also tells us very clearly, "Because the Lord disciplines the one he loves and

386
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,400
 he chastens everyone he accepts as his son."

387
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,560
 But this is the kind of testing that is designed to refine us, to burn away and cut away things

388
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:03,720
 of our life that are not of him, that are not of Christ, so that we can live more like

389
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,640
 Jesus.

390
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,480
 But sometimes when these testing comes too, we reject them, we resent them, we refuse

391
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,480
 to believe and we refuse to be changed and disciplined and discipled.

392
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,520
 And so we too fall away.

393
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,400
 But Jesus is asking too much, like Jethro was praying just now.

394
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,760
 He's demanding too much of my life.

395
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:33,400
 Only a heart that is deeply rooted in the Lord will withstand all the testing of life.

396
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,640
 And we need to be sure that we're not just fair-weather Christians because there is no

397
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,920
 such thing.

398
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,240
 Faith that only appears for a short time is no faith at all.

399
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,360
 Church, this is a warning, this is a pleading.

400
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,920
 Do not abandon the love that you first had.

401
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,560
 We don't want to be like dogs that return to their own vomit.

402
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,860
 We are called to be a people that endures and endures to the end.

403
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,460
 We are called to have a joy in our hearts that is there to stay no matter what comes.

404
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:16,680
 And for this to happen, the root of God's word must set in your heart.

405
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,620
 Now there's another group of people.

406
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,440
 This is the seed that falls among the thorns.

407
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,860
 And these stands for those who hear, but as they go on the way, they are choked up by

408
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,000
 life's worries and riches and pleasures.

409
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,540
 And so they do not mature.

410
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,200
 The third group of people are likened, and their hearts are likened to seed that grows

411
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,280
 up amongst the thorns.

412
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,120
 The thorns of life's worries, riches, and pleasures.

413
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,720
 And just like the seed before, there is some growth, but this growth is stunted.

414
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,460
 It's like an arrested development of these seeds.

415
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,120
 They are stunted because of the things of this world.

416
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,420
 Now you don't need me to tell you, but the worries in this life are plenty.

417
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,080
 We want to put on a brave face all the time.

418
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,820
 We want to walk around and appear as though as nothing has happened.

419
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,380
 Everything is fine, but life is full of worries.

420
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,440
 In this season, I can testify, I'll say to you right now, worrying is probably one of

421
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,900
 the biggest struggles right now.

422
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,200
 I worry for, my worries look like these days, for my family about able to afford sending

423
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,220
 our children to school, pay the school fees.

424
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,340
 School bills are expensive.

425
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,980
 Schooling in Hong Kong can be expensive.

426
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,380
 Whilst trying to save money, whilst trying to save for retirement, put food on the table,

427
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,180
 pay the rent, all this kind of stuff.

428
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,200
 This kind of stuff keeps me up at night sometimes.

429
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,140
 At the same time, my two sons have a genetic condition inherited from me that requires

430
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,220
 constant, it's a long-term thing for the rest of their lives.

431
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,220
 They're going to have to have doctor's visits and observation.

432
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,620
 Day to day, they're doing fine, but it's a worry because each and every doctor visit

433
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,880
 we have, I never know what the doctor is going to say.

434
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,660
 Some of these doctor visits have been great, oh yeah, he's doing fine.

435
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,860
 Some of these doctor visits have been like, ooh, what's that?

436
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,060
 We've got to keep an eye on that.

437
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,380
 And those things worry me.

438
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,940
 That's a reality in my life.

439
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:18,300
 I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't worried about these things.

440
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,620
 What about you, though?

441
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,140
 What are some of the worries, things that keep you up at night?

442
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:29,220
 Do you ever feel these are in danger of arresting your faith in Jesus?

443
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,740
 All right, well, I have the answer.

444
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,300
 What do we do when we worry?

445
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,500
 Just pray more.

446
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,160
 Just pray more and everything will be fine.

447
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,300
 You just pray, ask God to take out these worries and take them all away, and then pray for

448
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,840
 blessings, riches, and pleasures.

449
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,980
 And when you have those things, then everything will be fine and your faith in God will be

450
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,980
 great.

451
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,560
 Now, the interesting thing about this part is that riches and pleasures are also included

452
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,340
 in the list of things that can choke out your relationship with God.

453
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,260
 Isn't that interesting?

454
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,880
 Proponents of the prosperity of gospel will certainly have you believe that riches and

455
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,420
 pleasures are always what God wants to lavish on us.

456
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,680
 And can God bless us in this way?

457
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,380
 And has he blessed us before in this way?

458
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,380
 Absolutely.

459
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,820
 But beware, we see the problem of worry, but there is also the problem of pleasure.

460
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,620
 And it works itself out in two ways.

461
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,620
 Firstly, we might spend all our time just chasing pleasure.

462
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,460
 That's all we ever pray about when we talk to God.

463
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,700
 We want God to bless us, take away our troubles, take away our worries, give us the most comfortable

464
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,580
 life that we can have, the least amount of pain, the most amount of resources.

465
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,940
 And we only go to God when we're seeking these things.

466
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,940
 He becomes like an endorphin hit, like a pleasure machine, like a slot machine that we put our

467
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,940
 hope in.

468
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,620
 "Please God, give me a healing now.

469
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,940
 Oh no, not this time.

470
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,940
 Okay."

471
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,260
 And we keep on pulling that lever.

472
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:59,780
 And when we don't get the pleasures, our faith falls away and it doesn't grow.

473
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,900
 Or on the other hand, some of us have these things, we're living that life, and our life

474
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:09,740
 has become so sufficient and so self-sustaining and resourceful, we don't even think about

475
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,740
 God anymore.

476
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,980
 Or everything we need, everything we have, I can get, I have access to.

477
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,740
 And our lives become like the rich young ruler.

478
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,540
 "Oh, I want to follow you, Jesus."

479
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,220
 And Jesus challenges the rich young ruler.

480
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,180
 "Well, okay, give up all your stuff and then you can come and follow me."

481
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,780
 And in the end, he doesn't.

482
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,660
 He can't take Jesus intruding into his life.

483
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,140
 And we don't want to be the ones to have to sacrifice our pleasures in order to follow

484
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,420
 Jesus.

485
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
 And the consequences are the same.

486
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,940
 Our faith doesn't mature.

487
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,860
 It doesn't mature because we want Jesus on our own terms.

488
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,740
 And we're either constantly distracted by worries or we're constantly distracted by

489
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,700
 the riches and pleasure.

490
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,260
 And look, in the end, with these people, there isn't even a mention of faith whatsoever.

491
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,780
 There is no faith.

492
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:10,940
 Church, I pray that as a body, as believers, as followers, we will not get choked out by

493
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,240
 the realities of life.

494
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,340
 And the one thing I'm working on in this area, the thing I feel like keeps me grounded and

495
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,860
 closest to Jesus in this time when I'm worried about things or things of this life overwhelm

496
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:31,700
 me or when things get a bit too comfortable, is the word contentment.

497
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,940
 Like Paul says, "I have known what it's like to have little.

498
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:39,860
 I have known what it's like to have more than enough.

499
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,900
 But in every situation, I am content.

500
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,860
 I can do all things in Christ who gives me strength."

501
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:51,740
 It's like Paul saying to, begging Jesus, "Jesus, please take this thorn away from my flesh."

502
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,540
 Three times he begs and three times Jesus says no.

503
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,900
 Instead, he responds, "My grace is sufficient for you."

504
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,540
 And that was enough for Paul.

505
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:08,420
 Contentment is how we keep ourselves close to Jesus, to keep our faith nurtured, to keep

506
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,260
 God's word rooted in our hearts when we're faced with the worries and the pleasures of

507
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,380
 life.

508
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,420
 No good news so far, right?

509
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
 It's been a bit heavy.

510
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,580
 I understand that.

511
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,140
 It's coming.

512
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:29,120
 These soils, because, have not allowed the seed to do what it was supposed to do, which

513
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,540
 is to grow, to mature, to take root, and to bear fruit.

514
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,700
 In other words, I think what Jesus is trying to say is, if your life and your heart represent

515
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:45,140
 soil that is hard or is rootless or gets choked out, you have not yet really truly stepped

516
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,180
 into a relationship with me.

517
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,900
 Because if you had, this is what life would be like.

518
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,100
 This is the kind of heart, this is the kind of people that Jesus is looking for.

519
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:03,340
 The seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart who hear the word,

520
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:09,540
 retain it, and by persevering, produce a crop.

521
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,120
 Notice how God defines noble and good.

522
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,980
 People who hear and retain are noble and good.

523
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,980
 This is what happens when seed meets good soil.

524
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,540
 These people don't have hard hearts.

525
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,820
 They have hearts that are noble and good.

526
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,580
 These are the kind of hearts that don't fall away or don't get choked out by worries and

527
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:35,420
 pleasure because they persevere.

528
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,260
 This is the kind of heart, when the seed meets the soil, the seed is able to fulfill its

529
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:47,280
 potential to do what it's meant to do and to produce a crop, to bear fruit.

530
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,900
 This is the point of discipleship.

531
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,980
 This is the aim of following Jesus with your life.

532
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,060
 True discipleship, a true sign of whether or not you really have a heart that follows

533
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:01,660
 Jesus is to see whether or not you have fruit to show for it.

534
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:07,880
 But the key word here is this, perseverance is the key.

535
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,780
 Because crop, fruit doesn't just pop up overnight.

536
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,460
 Those chia pets, as gimmicky as they are, takes time to grow.

537
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:23,060
 The only way this crop grows, the only way the fruit comes is through time, is through

538
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,620
 persevering.

539
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,820
 In other words, it's not that the enemy hasn't maybe tried to snatch the seed away.

540
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,740
 It's not that the good seed and the good soil is free from testing and temptations.

541
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,140
 It's not that the seed is free from worries of riches and pleasures and everything that

542
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,520
 comes with life.

543
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,980
 This soil probably had to deal with all these things as well.

544
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:47,940
 But the key difference is that they persevere, they don't give up.

545
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:54,580
 It requires a lifetime of response to consider what one's soul looks like to a slowly developing

546
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,460
 crop.

547
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:03,380
 Fruit does not appear overnight, neither does the harvest of our heart.

548
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:09,920
 Which is why the Bible tells us time and time again, be strong and courageous, endure.

549
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,260
 It is the one who endures to the end who will be saved.

550
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,860
 We will reap what we sow when we don't give up.

551
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:23,180
 Run with endurance the race that is set before you, church.

552
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:29,460
 A fruitful life looks like a life alive with faith.

553
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,580
 That's when we see the crop.

554
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:39,060
 That's when we see the fruit of a heart that has God's Word taken root in it.

555
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,820
 So again, what does this look like?

556
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,340
 Luke actually gives us some examples.

557
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,740
 Just as he gave examples of people that didn't listen to the Word of God and didn't take

558
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,320
 in their hearts, there are good examples of this too.

559
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,140
 So a fruitful life looks like the woman who were with Jesus at the beginning of our story.

560
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:01,260
 When I began reading this message, I began in Luke 8, verse 1 intentionally because it

561
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:07,060
 describes a group of women whom Jesus had healed, cast out demons, healed from diseases.

562
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,260
 But look what their response is.

563
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,620
 Luke tells us that Jesus helped these women.

564
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,820
 He had healed them, but now their response was, "These women were helping to support

565
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,140
 Jesus' ministry out of their own means."

566
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,980
 They didn't let their resources, they didn't let the pleasures and the comfort that came

567
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,220
 with what they had stop their faith in Jesus.

568
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,100
 Rather, they used it to serve Him and His ministry.

569
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,460
 Luke shares the story of the Roman centurion who had so much faith, he told Jesus, "You

570
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,540
 don't need to come to my house.

571
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,780
 I'm not worthy of you coming to my house for you to heal my servant, but just say the

572
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,540
 word and my servant will be healed."

573
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,980
 That's what fruit looks like.

574
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:54,180
 The faith on display is the sinful woman who broke open, perfumed the most precious thing

575
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,820
 she had in order to honor and anoint Jesus' feet.

576
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:06,180
 A faith on display is John the Baptist living a life in the desert, eating locusts and honey.

577
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,180
 People thought he was crazy, people thought he was mad, but he dedicated his life to proclaiming

578
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,620
 the word of God, to prepare the way of the coming of the Messiah.

579
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:23,420
 That was what his life mission was about and nothing could stop him from doing that.

580
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,340
 And so here's the surprising end of this passage.

581
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,620
 Actually, it's not a coincidence that Jesus' teaching about a lamp on the stand actually

582
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,500
 comes at the end of this parable.

583
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,820
 Because the lamp on the stand is actually another mini-parable, Jesus trying to explain

584
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,260
 what He has just said.

585
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,020
 A lamp is meant to what?

586
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,940
 Shed light and not be hidden.

587
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,740
 A seed is meant to bear fruit and not to be snatched up or growthless.

588
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:58,540
 A follower of Jesus is meant to live a life of faith, rooted in the word of God and then

589
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,180
 inspires others to do the same.

590
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:06,140
 Church, if you have ears today, then we need to hear.

591
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,180
 What kind of soil do we want to be?

592
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:14,780
 You know, as I was thinking about this, it brought me all the way back to Genesis.

593
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,260
 It sounds like Andrew, I know, but it brought me back to Genesis.

594
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,780
 Because when God created human beings, how did He create us?

595
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,220
 He created us from the soil.

596
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:35,220
 God formed us out of the soil and breathed His life into us.

597
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,540
 God created you to be that soil.

598
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:46,180
 To be that soil where once His word is planted in you, we take root and bear fruit.

599
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,480
 To make a difference in this world.

600
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,320
 To make a difference in your life.

601
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,220
 Because we have a world out there that is starving and hungry and they need to know

602
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,220
 who they are and who God sees them and how much God loves them.

603
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,940
 And without seed that bears fruit, this whole world is going to be hungry and die without

604
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,100
 Him.

605
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,140
 And that's not the world we want to see.

606
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,740
 That's not the society we want to build.

607
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,300
 That's not what God's kingdom looks like.

608
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:19,140
 God's kingdom is about bearing fruit and fruit that bears even more fruit.

609
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,300
 A thousandfold, a hundredfold.

610
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,620
 Church, what kind of soil do we want to be?

611
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:34,780
 May we be the kind of soil that God's word can take root and grow and bear fruit for

612
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:41,020
 ourselves, for our lives, for this city and for the world that so desperately needs Him.

613
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:51,020
