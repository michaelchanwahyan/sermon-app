[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   I asked him what were the things on his heart, what were the things that he was looking forward
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.960]   to in life.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.720]   And he told me about a new film that he was really excited for.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.520]   He told me about a book he was wanting to write.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.680]   He told me about how he was longing to come back to Hong Kong and be here at the Vine
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.520]   and share a testimony of his heart for us as a church.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.800]   And it really stings that he's not here anymore.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.600]   And I know many of you are mourning as we step into 2021 for him.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.040]   Josh loved the Vine.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.760]   The Vine was his church for 20 years.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.200]   It was a part of his community.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.920]   It was the only church that he knew in his adult life.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.720]   And it was a place of comfort for him.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.480]   He sat through countless numbers of my sermons over the years.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.760]   I kind of feel sorry for the guy, so many sermons.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.200]   And he sat there and he was always the loudest amen for me.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.600]   I mean even in the days when I had off days, he would still be the loudest amen cheering
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.720]   me on.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.200]   You know, he told me recently that he was grateful for his cancer.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.960]   I know that sounds like a very strange thing to say, but Josh understood what it was that
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.400]   the cancer was doing in him.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.040]   He understood the seriousness of it.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.320]   He knew that it was bringing him to a place where his life was under threat.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560]   He understood that.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.960]   But Josh never had time for the idea of thinking about dying.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.000]   Josh's whole life and his whole legacy he leaves is the idea of what it is to live,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.140]   to be full of life.
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.200]   Josh walked into the worst moments of his life in his last two years of his battle with cancer.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.480]   And he did so with a huge amount of life on his heart.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.240]   He was constantly telling me, challenging me, asking me about how I was growing in my
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.800]   life as I saw him grow so much in his life.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.520]   He would look at himself and he would say, "Hey, cancer is a part of my reality, but
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.840]   it is not my identity."
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.760]   Josh never allowed himself to wallow in any place of self-pity.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.200]   He never looked for the people around him to kind of pity him or walk with him.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.960]   Josh always raised the bar of hope.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.600]   He always raised the bar of positivity in conversations that he had with him.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.320]   I know even in the last couple of months when he was in great pain, I still would leave
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.080]   a conversation with him feeling better about myself.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.960]   And he had this idea that his greatest amount of growth and his greatest amount of change
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.040]   could actually happen in the hardest moments of his life.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.560]   And like I say, I knew him for 25 years and I can testify that his growth as a person
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.880]   in the last number of months before he passed away was some of the most tremendous I'd seen.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.360]   He was always the most positive, the most kindest person I think I've ever met.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.900]   But even in the last few months of his life, that just increased even more.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.360]   And he would speak constantly to me of the ways in which he felt healed.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.000]   In fact, to be honest with you, if Josh was standing with me right here in this moment,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.480]   I think he would look in the camera and he would say that cancer healed him.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.500]   Even though we know that cancer took his life, he would tell you that cancer healed him.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.300]   Because for Josh, healing was so much more than just what happens to your physical body.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.640]   Healing for him was about your emotions.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.560]   It was about your psychology.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.320]   It was about your relationships.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.680]   It was about your spiritual life.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.040]   And he would testify to you right now that through cancer and through all the struggle
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.760]   that he had in the last few months of his life and all the suffering that I saw that
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.960]   he went through, he felt like he was in the greatest place of his relationships, the greatest
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.340]   place of his marriage with Chelsea, the greatest place as a father to Emery, the greatest place
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.000]   of his relationships with his friends around him.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.280]   He felt like he had grown and changed in his person more than ever.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.280]   He had become more forgiving.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.400]   He had been released of some of the stuff that he'd been carrying in his life.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.320]   He had been able to put himself in a place where he was at peace with who he is in a
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.760]   way that I had never seen before.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.320]   And then that was particularly true about his relationship with Jesus.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.200]   You know, one of the things that I celebrate today as I stand before you with all the emotions
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.680]   that I'm carrying is where he was in his relationship with Jesus before he passed.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.000]   I mean, he'd always had a strong relationship with God.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.040]   That had been something that was so important to Josh all of his life.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.600]   And I'd had the great privilege of journeying with him in his 20s and 30s and seeing that
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.080]   relationship grow.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.760]   But in the last few months, that relationship went to a whole nother level.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.320]   I would love his WhatsApps and his voice messages in the middle of the night, particularly when
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   he was in Mexico.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.920]   He'd send them and I'd wake up in the morning and they would be overnight.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.480]   And he would tell me about how excited he was about Jesus.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.280]   He would share something with me in like a little voicemail about what Jesus had said
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.040]   to him that day about how he was growing in his relationship.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.360]   I saw an intimacy with Josh and Jesus that I had never seen before in any other time
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.360]   in his life.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.640]   It was in his greatest moments of trauma and hardship and suffering that Josh was propelled,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.320]   was catalyzed into his greatest moments of his relationship with Jesus.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.480]   Where I think in that much suffering, I would have probably distanced myself from God.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.040]   Josh became closer and more intimate to his Savior.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.960]   He flourished in a place where things were really difficult.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   That didn't mean it was always easy for him.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.720]   It didn't mean that things were really light and fluffy the whole time.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.320]   I knew the depth of the pain and the hardship that he was going through.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.040]   And yet he always chose life.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.720]   He always chose to challenge himself and to grow.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.280]   And where I may have backed away and been bitter, he pressed in and became more intimate
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280]   to Jesus.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.440]   And today, church, we're standing right here at the start of 2021.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.360]   We're standing literally in a new season, in a new moment, in a new year.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.980]   And I think we stand at a crossroads where we have now a decision to make.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.600]   It's a decision that I think Josh's life brings us to.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.320]   It's a decision that I think his legacy leaves behind for us and challenges us with.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:36.640]   And the decision is this, that we would consciously allow our negative experience to spur positive
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.920]   change.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.480]   That we as a church and that we as individuals would allow the hardships, the hard times,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.000]   the struggles to actually not bring us into the worst case scenario of thinking, to not
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   hold us back and to weigh us down, but actually to propel us into the greatest moments of
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.140]   our humanity, propel us into the greatest moments of our growth and make us more intimate
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.040]   with Jesus than we have ever been before.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.720]   I think we have an opportunity right here at the start of the year to honor the legacy
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.040]   that Josh leaves behind by saying to ourselves, are we going to allow 2020 and all of the
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.440]   stuff that we've been through to move us into this year with some grave clothes around us?
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.400]   Or are we going to step into this year in new life and faith and hope, believing that
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:28.280]   2021 could be our greatest moment of intimacy with the people in our lives and with the
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.280]   people of Jesus?
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.880]   Look, 2021 has been a hard year for all of us.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.800]   Sorry, 2020 has been a hard year for all of us.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.520]   It's been a difficult time.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   Many of you watching this, you've lost people in the last year.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.160]   You've lost loved ones, maybe to COVID or to other things, and you're not being able
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.320]   to travel to go and be with them at that time.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.800]   There's been this global pandemic that has shut us all down and kind of locked us all
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.400]   away at times.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.440]   There's been an economic disaster upon this world.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.040]   Many of you have lost jobs and there have been small businesses that have been closed
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.280]   throughout our city.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.600]   And I also want to say that here in Hong Kong, alongside of this pandemic and everything
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.360]   there, there's also been a shift and a change in the politics of our city.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.680]   There's been a change in the things that have happened in our society that we're all still
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.080]   trying to walk through and work through, and that's still having an impact on each one
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.040]   of us.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.840]   Every single one of us, we faced such a challenging year.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.080]   And as we step now into 2021, we'd be forgiven for feeling a little bit timid, right?
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.720]   There's still quite a lot of uncertainty ahead for us.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.480]   We don't know exactly what's going to happen with this virus.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.120]   We don't know whether this vaccine is going to be perfect and suddenly set everything
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.120]   right.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.840]   We don't know when we're going to be able to travel again.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.680]   If you've lost your job, you're probably wondering, "When am I going to find employment again?"
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   There's a lot of things that are still uncertain and unknown, and we'd be forgiven for stepping
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.640]   into this year with a bit of fear in us, with a bit of timidity, with a bit of wondering
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.980]   what's ahead, with not excitement, but actually a heaviness to us.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.440]   We would be forgiven for feeling that way.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.880]   But I want to stand before you right now and say, "I think we've got another choice.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.440]   I think that we could actually start this year and be inspired by someone like Josh,
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.560]   that we can start this year no matter what we have been through, no matter what we have
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   been."
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.920]   I'm not downplaying what you have been through.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.080]   I've been through a lot in the last year myself, but I'm going to make a commitment to start
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.040]   this year facing forwards, looking forward to the things that I believe God can do in
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.760]   me, because if His resurrection spirit is in me, then I believe that He can bring me
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.720]   out of my grave clothes into new life.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:49.160]   I wonder whether that's also what you might be feeling as you step now into this new year.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:56.760]   You see, as we step into 2021, we can either do so with hope or with fear.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.520]   We can do so in death or in life.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.840]   The decision, I believe, rests with us.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:12.880]   I want to invite you into a new season of life today as we start this new series.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.440]   A few months ago, a friend of mine sent me an article from a counseling magazine, and
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.080]   the article was all about this idea of something that I had never heard of.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.040]   It was called post-traumatic growth.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.240]   Now we've all heard about post-traumatic stress.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.000]   We all know what that is, that when we go through a trauma or a hard time, that the
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.320]   stress of that, the anxiety of that, the fear of that can impact us for the many years ahead.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.840]   This article spoke about the other side of trauma.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.760]   This was first discovered back in the '90s, but the research has grown and it's become
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.920]   more prominent in the last number of years.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.760]   The idea that actually there's this other thing, this post-traumatic growth, that our
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.320]   traumas, that our hard times, the hardships that we face and that we go through could
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.920]   actually be a catalyst to the greatest moments of our growth and our change.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:08.120]   The article actually describes post-traumatic growth like this, positive life experience
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:16.400]   that is the result of adversity or other challenges that gives rise to a higher level of functioning,
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.000]   a higher level of awareness in us.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.800]   And here's the thing that I thought was amazing about this article.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.400]   It said that in the people that they studied who had gone through some great trauma and
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.200]   yet had come out of it in a place of growth and change, the article said that the depth
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:38.040]   of that growth and change was of such a high level that there's no way it would have been
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.080]   possible unless they had gone through that trauma in the first place.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.200]   In other words, the trauma was the catalyst to a level of growth they never would have
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.000]   experienced unless they would have faced that thing they had to go through.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.120]   And I know, I don't know about you, but when I go through trauma or hard times, my tendency
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.320]   is to want to try to ignore it or avoid it or push it away.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.120]   The research has said that actually the way we grow through trauma is not by pushing it
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:12.520]   or ignoring it or trying to avoid it, but actually staring it face to face, by actually
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.800]   learning what it is to embrace it, to understand it.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:23.040]   Doesn't mean you have to like it or welcome it, but sit in the reality of that trauma
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   in your life.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.560]   And as you embrace the emotions of it, don't try to fight them as you're real and honest
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   with them.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.980]   From there, you can begin to look forward to the things that the trauma might produce
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.960]   and create in you.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.360]   It is exactly this that I saw Josh do.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.080]   He was able to face those hard things that were going on around him and not make those
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.980]   so much a part of his identity that they began to shape his thinking, but actually use those
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:57.640]   things to propel him into something that was even greater.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.320]   What we're going to do in this series is we're going to look over the next six weeks at what
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.280]   post-traumatic growth is all about.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.000]   And in this series, I want to bring together both psychology, the way we think and act
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.280]   in our emotions in our humanity, and theology and the Spirit of God and the work of the
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.600]   divine amongst us.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.200]   My prayer over the next six weeks is that you'll be able to actually start 2021 with
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:26.360]   a change in the way that you think, a mindset shift that brings you into the place of actually
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.540]   your greatest moments of growth.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:35.600]   In the article, it says that post-traumatic growth happens most in five prominent areas.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.640]   And it's these five areas that we're going to be looking at over the coming weeks in
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.640]   this series.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.780]   The first area is just this appreciation for life.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:50.160]   The second area is the idea of our relationships with one another and how those grow and change.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:57.480]   The third area is new possibilities of life, like what I want to do new now as I emerge
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.160]   out of this trauma that I've experienced.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.320]   The fourth is this idea of personal strength.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.560]   How have I grown?
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.960]   How have I become stronger through this time?
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.480]   And then finally, the idea, and I think this is really interesting because the article
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.600]   was from a secular publication, but it spoke about the fifth thing they saw in people,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.360]   and that was the deepening of spiritual change.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.680]   So there was a spiritual shift for people.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.480]   And so what we're going to do in this series is we're going to take a look at those five
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.480]   things, but not through the eyes of what a journal article tells us, but through the
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.200]   eyes of what the Gospels show to us.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.520]   We're going to go to the life of Jesus, and in each of the weeks, we're going to take
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.200]   a story of Jesus that speaks to one of these ideas of post-traumatic growth.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.920]   Look, Jesus spent his whole time dealing with people in trauma, people that were either
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.000]   in trauma, going through it, or coming out of it.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.320]   And Jesus met people right where they were at, whether they were demon-possessed, whether
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.520]   they were poor, whether they were under some affliction from disease, whether they were
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.520]   afraid or under the oppression of an empire or a community around them, whatever it might
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.520]   be.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.920]   Jesus met people in the places of their struggle and their trial and their trauma, and in those
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.060]   places, he brought them life.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.120]   He helped them to understand the way to see the world differently.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.600]   The kingdom of God came alive to them.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.380]   And my prayer is we go through these different stories over the coming weeks, you'll also
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:22.240]   begin to shift your thinking and your prayers and your expectations for everything that's
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.040]   ahead of you in 2021.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:31.640]   I believe that as you see Jesus turn trauma into change, into transformation, you're going
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.920]   to be inspired to ask him to come and do the same for you.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.320]   You know, one of the things that we want to make sure we're emphasizing in 2021 here at
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.120]   The Vine is not just what happens here on Church Everywhere on Sundays.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.840]   As much as we love to gather like this and we'll continue to do that, we realize that
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.960]   discipleship happens in many other formats than just this one that I'm doing right now
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.560]   in preaching to you.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:00.320]   And so for this series, we want this idea of post-traumatic growth to go wider for you
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.880]   and to be in a variety of ways that you can think about it and absorb it in your own discipleship.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.800]   So as well as just the sermon series on a Sunday, there are three other particular ways
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.680]   we want you to get a hold of this idea and perhaps to grow in this area for you.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.840]   The first, as we've talked about already and Pastor Ellison shared at the beginning of
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:25.840]   our services, is the 21-day devotional series that's coming up just starting on Monday,
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.360]   the 11th of January.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.920]   The actual devotional series begins on the 10th because I'm going to put out an intro
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.600]   to the series on that day.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.360]   And then for 21 days from the Monday, we're having a devotion from somebody in The Vine
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.720]   community who has actually experienced trauma in their lives, gone through something really
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.920]   hard and really difficult, and has grown out of that.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.560]   And those devotionals are a daily testimony to the power of a God to change us and to
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.240]   grow us in the mix of the worst moments of life.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.480]   And there are stories about people who have lost loved ones, stories of people who have
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.900]   lost their work, stories of people that have had to leave Hong Kong, stories that really
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:07.120]   are challenging and deep, but actually bring great inspiration as they have met and discovered
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.320]   Christ in them.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.960]   So I pray that those devotionals will be a great way for you to deepen your personal
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.040]   discipleship in this idea of post-traumatic growth.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.840]   Alongside of that, we're going to be running a couple of courses in February so that you
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.080]   can take the teaching of this series to a much deeper level.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.720]   The first course is called Transforming Trauma, and that's going to start on February the
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   6th.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   That's a Saturday.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.560]   And it's going to be run by our Chinese community here at The Vine.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.160]   It's going to be available for absolutely everybody.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.480]   And it's going to be a four-week course that takes you through how it is that you can practically
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.560]   transform trauma in your life.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.720]   It's going to look at the emotions of trauma, the processing of trauma, as well as the ability
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.680]   to then walk beyond it into something new.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.560]   So that's Transforming Trauma.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:59.120]   Now after that, starting on Saturday the 20th of February, we're going to have Healing Trauma.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.320]   And Healing Trauma is another course designed to actually practically pray with you and
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.200]   walk with you spiritually in the healing of your own traumatic experiences.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.040]   And so where Transforming Trauma will bring a thinking and a reflection and a biblical
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:19.840]   study around trauma, Healing Trauma is going to be more practical, hands-on prayer and
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.920]   ministry for you as you come out of a place of trauma in your life.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.320]   And we're so excited that we can provide both that theory and that study and the biblical
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.440]   basis but also come around you, lay hands, and pray for you and see you delivered into
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.760]   the best year that you can.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.600]   And the third thing is that I've just recently put out a personal podcast called A Broken
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   Hallelujah.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:47.020]   And A Broken Hallelujah is all based around this idea of post-traumatic growth.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:52.320]   And in the podcast, what I do twice a month is I interview somebody from around the world
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.520]   who's gone through some crazy hard experience and yet has met God, who has wrestled with
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.160]   God and walked away with a bit of a limp.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.840]   And we look at those stories.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.680]   And the reason why I'm mentioning this to you guys today is that the very first episode
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.880]   is actually a conversation I had just a few weeks ago with Josh.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.360]   And in that conversation, Josh talks all about the ways in which he has grown through his
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.960]   cancer journey.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.440]   It's a beautiful conversation.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.200]   It's incredibly challenging and yet so hopeful.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.960]   And I want to really encourage you.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.520]   I can't stand here and tell you about his growth.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.040]   I want you to hear him tell you about his growth.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.160]   I want him to tell his story.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.840]   So that's the first episode of the podcast.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.520]   You can go to Spotify or you can go to Apple Podcasts.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.080]   Just type in A Broken Hallelujah.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.980]   You'll find it and you can hear Josh tell you his story of growth through trauma.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.640]   And our prayer is that through all of those things, you'll be able to be deeply discipled
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.840]   in this change for you as you step into the new year.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:01.280]   Now I know that as we do begin this new year, we're all carrying stuff with us from 2020.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.760]   We've already talked about this.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.400]   We felt it in our worship time.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:10.000]   I want to lay a foundation to growing out of trauma today by focusing a little bit on
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.040]   the things that we might be carrying into this new year.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.080]   I want you to take a moment just to think about what it is that you are carrying.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.840]   And let me be honest with you about a few of the things that I feel I'm carrying in
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.240]   my spirit as I'm stepping into this new year.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.880]   I think I'm carrying anger, grief, and hurt.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:34.400]   I'm angry at what happened with Josh and I stand in solidarity and anger on behalf of
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:40.720]   Chelsea and Emery as they face their future of uncertainty at this time.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.120]   And that really upsets me.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.680]   I'm carrying this latent sense of anger at God for all that's taken place and for the
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.600]   loss that I'm feeling.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.380]   I'm also sensing grief.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.560]   Of course grief for Josh and that, but also actually, and I want to say this, I'm carrying
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.360]   a sense of grief for our city, for Hong Kong.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.880]   And I don't know about you, but the changes that I've seen in the last six months have
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.760]   been very difficult to see.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.360]   And I'm walking into a place where I'm grieving something for our city.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.000]   I'm grieving something for the people of Hong Kong.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.200]   And that's something that I feel very much on my spirit as I step into the new year.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.800]   The other thing I'm feeling is hurt.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.940]   Last year, 2020, was probably the hardest year of leadership for me.
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.200]   It's not easy to lead a church community in a time of crisis.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.480]   It is exciting because you get to see God act and move in crisis in beautiful ways.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.320]   The church always grows the best in a place of struggle or trial or suffering.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.780]   And we definitely saw that in 2020.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.700]   But on a personal level, it was quite difficult.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.700]   I had a number of times in the year where I made decisions for us as a church where
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.500]   I came under strong personal criticism.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.900]   And I have to be honest, that hurt.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.900]   And I've had to process some of that, and I'm still processing it.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.540]   And I feel that hurt on me a little bit as I still step now into 21.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.300]   I'm sure you're carrying some things on you.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:03.140]   And because I'm carrying these things, I know the theory of post-traumatic growth, but the
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:07.940]   idea of getting there, the idea of shifting towards it still feels a little bit scary
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.940]   for me.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:14.040]   I'm still a little bit skeptical if I'm honest, if I could really grow through the hard times
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.040]   that I face.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.420]   And maybe that's also how you're feeling in this moment as well.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:26.220]   Well, if so, I want to talk to you just for a few moments about wounds and scars.
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.440]   Wounds and scars are interesting.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.100]   They're actually very different, although they come together in a similar way.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.300]   Let me explain.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.260]   Wounds and scars are formed out of a place of trauma, out of a place of suffering.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.100]   Wounds and scars are things that we all experience.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:46.740]   And they're physical when we've had some sort of suffering that is a physical thing, but
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:51.940]   they can also be emotional or psychological or even spiritual.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.100]   But they are also distinctly different.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.660]   Let me explain this.
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:00.520]   Wounds are what happens to us in the moment of suffering.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.220]   Wounds are what take place when we are afflicted by something and they hurt.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.540]   There's pain there.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.220]   They are open wounds before us.
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.440]   And our wounds stay with us during a healing process.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:19.120]   The wounds begin to take time to go from that place of openness and hurt and pain to a place
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   of healing.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.220]   And in that process, the wounds still hurt.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:28.540]   When we carry wounds with us, we are carrying with us that sense of that anxiety and that
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.000]   vulnerability.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.720]   Our wounds, because they're open and they're bleeding and there's pain there, we want to
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.440]   cover them and they create this vulnerability in us.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.480]   Scars are very different.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.900]   Scars are wounds that have healed.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:50.860]   Scars if you will, are the things that remain after the healing process has been completed
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.540]   from a wound.
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.700]   Scars are the very things that actually say to us that the wound did not survive, that
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.560]   the wound was not the thing that had the victory.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:06.900]   The scar is the proof, even though sometimes they're quite ugly, they're the beautiful
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.380]   proof that the wound did not win.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:15.940]   Our scars are the things that we carry with us that tell two sides to a story.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.460]   You see, wounds only tell one story.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.940]   They tell the story of pain.
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.220]   But scars tell two stories.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:29.880]   The scar on you shows you that there was a moment of wound, a moment of pain, a moment
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:35.700]   of suffering, but the scar also tells the more powerful story of your healing.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:45.140]   See, I think in the story of life, our scars make healing more central than the hurting.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.940]   And the Bible is full of stories about scars.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:55.060]   And perhaps the most famous of those is the story of Thomas and the story of Jesus in
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.820]   His resurrection coming to Thomas in that room and Thomas reaching forward and touching
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.860]   the scars of Jesus.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:07.820]   And we've come to call Thomas the doubting Thomas, and I think we so misunderstand this
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.820]   person.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.060]   And I want to just take a few moments in the little bit of time that I've got remaining
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.900]   to open up this passage of Scripture to us because I think in here we see something in
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:22.500]   Thomas that's going to inspire you as you start your journey of post-traumatic growth.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:28.340]   And let me read this to us from John chapter 20 starting in verse 24.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:34.460]   "Now Thomas, called Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.140]   So when the other disciples told him, 'We have seen the Lord.'
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:43.500]   But he said to them, 'Hey, unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:50.060]   where the nails were and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.'
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.580]   A week later his disciples were in the house again and Thomas was with them.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.940]   Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 'Peace be with
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.940]   you.'
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.740]   Then he said to Thomas, 'Hey, put your finger here and see my hands.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.380]   Reach out your hand and put it in my side.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.620]   Stop doubting and believe.'
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:13.580]   And Thomas said to him, 'My Lord and my God.'"
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.860]   I love this story of Thomas.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.180]   I think it opens up for us so much of where we might be here at the beginning of 2021.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.780]   You know, it's interesting that we call him the doubting Thomas.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.860]   Jesus does say to him, "Stop doubting and believing."
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.420]   But it's important to put this in context because all of the disciples were doubting
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.420]   before they first met Jesus.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.660]   It's not that Thomas was this special doubter who really struggled to believe that Jesus
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.140]   had risen from the dead.
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:44.420]   All of the disciples had that issue before they actually met the resurrected Christ.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:49.660]   In fact, in the Gospel of John, John makes it an actual purpose in his narrative to explain
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.340]   the reality that all of the disciples were confused.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:57.500]   There's even Mary right there in the garden tomb where Jesus has literally just been resurrected
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.900]   and she thinks Jesus is the gardener.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.500]   And it's not until Jesus speaks that she recognizes him.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.420]   And there are all the disciples in the room and Jesus comes and comes before them and
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.380]   they have no idea who he is.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:15.260]   They're skeptical about his presence and Jesus volunteers to the disciples.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.420]   He says, "Here, see the scars in my hands.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.260]   See the scars and the wounds on my side.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.360]   See this and know that I am now with you."
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.580]   And Thomas wasn't there in that moment.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.920]   He was somewhere else.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:34.220]   And so when the disciples begin to tell Thomas, "Hey, we've seen the risen Jesus."
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.720]   Here's Thomas's response.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:43.340]   He says, "I won't believe that the person that you think is Jesus is actually my Messiah
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:47.820]   unless I have proof of the suffering that he went through."
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:53.660]   See, this is profound, guys, because where we've called him doubting Thomas, I think
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.980]   actually he's grieving Thomas.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:02.900]   I think Thomas is actually the only disciple who understands that the identity of the Messiah,
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:08.060]   even in his resurrection, is rooted in an incredible experience of suffering that this
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.140]   one had been through.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:15.140]   Where the others remained skeptical and Jesus had to volunteer his scars, Thomas is the
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.460]   only one who wants to look for them.
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:25.140]   He wants to actually see that Jesus is this one because for him, for Jesus is the one
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:30.580]   who's actually walking with a whole story of suffering that moves into transformation.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.740]   For Thomas, for him to understand who the Messiah is, it is not to divorce him from
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.740]   the cross.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.700]   It is not to suddenly look at Jesus as some triumphalistic kind of glory person who floats
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.700]   above the ground.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:47.780]   For Thomas, no, his Messiah, his resurrected Jesus is going to be the one that's going
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:52.980]   to bear the scars of the pain and the suffering and the trauma and the grief of what he went
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.980]   through.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:29:00.080]   Thomas saw the suffering of Christ and he wanted to touch the scars to know that this
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:08.300]   one was the one who had gone through the worst moment of life and yet now was transformed.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:15.820]   You see, for Thomas, the scars were actually revealing the depth of the suffering being
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.300]   turned into transformation.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:24.220]   The way that he wanted to understand the glory of the resurrection was never divorced from
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.540]   the pain of the cross.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:33.880]   Thomas saw redemption not as the erasure of pain, the ending of pain.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:39.880]   No, for Thomas, for him, redemption was about the ability to live beyond the pain and the
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:48.360]   suffering and yet in that carry with you the scars of that journey as a story to be told.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:55.480]   And Thomas has the boldness, the courage to reach out and say to this person, "I won't
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:02.920]   believe that you're him unless you can show me that you have been transformed to the suffering
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.600]   that you've experienced."
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.960]   I think that's a profound reflection on the person of Thomas.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   And think about this from Jesus' perspective.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.840]   You see, I don't know about you, but for me, with my scars, and I've got a few, I like
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:22.240]   to hide them from people because our scars, don't they become places of shame or embarrassment?
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:27.960]   I've got actually a big scar on my back from a botched surgery that I had in my 20s and
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.520]   I'm still a little bit embarrassed by it.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.760]   It's a big kind of ugly kind of scar on my back and so I'm kind of glad it's behind me
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.200]   that I never get to see it.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.040]   And even if I'm at a swimming pool or something and I got my shirt off and I'm a little bit
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.960]   conscious and aware of this big scar there, Jesus shows up to his disciples bearing the
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   scars of an incredible trauma and he voluntarily shows it to them.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.920]   There's no shame for Jesus in the suffering that he had been through.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.480]   There was no shame for the fact that he had had wounds at one point in his life, but those
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.840]   wounds had taken sin and brought it to the grave.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:08.120]   And he stands before them and he says, "Touch this, touch this, intimately come to me because
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:13.240]   these scars are proof that the wounding did not win.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:19.080]   These scars are proof that resurrection life has happened, that sin has been put to death
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.800]   forever and now life is available for you.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.720]   Come and touch the scars."
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.280]   I believe church that this is the call on us as we start this new year.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:36.360]   I believe that Jesus leans forward to you no matter what you've come out of in 2020
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.760]   and he shows you his scars again and he welcomes you.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.440]   He says, "Come and touch the place of my hand.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.600]   Touch and see the place on my side.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:53.520]   Come and see where the wounds have been turned into victory and transformation and life because
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:32:02.840]   if it happens to me, the same spirit that did this in me is now in you."
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:09.800]   That he can come and bring that change and that transformation to you.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.360]   That's what this is all about.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:18.520]   And perhaps like you, I'm carrying both wounds and scars as I step into 2021.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.240]   I have scars from last year where there were really hard times but I overcame them.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.920]   The spirit of God helped me and healed me and I'm victorious over them and I stand in
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.280]   2021 stronger because I bear some scars from last year.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.160]   And I'm proud of that and I'm grateful for the work of Christ in my life.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.600]   But I also carry wounds in me right here and right now.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.640]   Places where I'm still looking for the healing to be complete.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:53.040]   Places where I'm still desiring for Christ to come and close the wound and create a scar.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.600]   And the other scars that I hold are proof to me.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.880]   They preach to me.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.920]   They speak over me that the wounds that I'm still carrying will not have the victory.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:08.360]   That he can come and by the blood that he pours out on the cross, he can cover up the
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:15.440]   wounds that I still carry and bring them into a place of healed life.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.360]   That's the growth that I believe God has for us as a church.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.520]   I think that's the testimony and the legacy that Josh leaves us as a church.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.600]   It's what we're now invited into.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.760]   See, the cross of Jesus on the cross.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:38.360]   God places God's woundedness before yours.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:43.040]   And in that, he invites you to heal.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.320]   That's the new year for us.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:51.720]   An invitation to see the woundedness of Jesus on the cross and the scars that he carries
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.200]   in his resurrection.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:01.760]   And look at all the woundedness that we carry and pray that God would create scars on us.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:07.240]   And that in that, we might be able to celebrate a newness of life.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:13.680]   Let me close by sharing some words from Josh that Josh wrote in a devotional that he produced
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.240]   and that is a part of our 21 Devay devotional that's coming up.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.400]   And I want to read these words to you as an encouragement to you from him.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:28.220]   He says this, "I have come to believe that God's plan and purpose are not as we might
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:32.800]   prefer to steer us away from the burdens and brokenness.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:39.040]   Rather, each step we take with him takes us through valleys and hardships in baby steps
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.120]   that build our faith and our resilience.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:49.020]   His power with our perseverance keeps us growing and continuing to be shaped into the incredible
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.520]   sons and daughters he's always planned for us to be.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.600]   It is through suffering that we are made perfect in him."
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.040]   Think about that for a sec.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.240]   It is through suffering that we are made perfect in him.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.680]   We have all experienced some suffering in 2020.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:17.120]   As we now step into 2021, may we now experience a release of the Spirit of God upon us that
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.500]   takes those wounds that we're carrying with us and brings them into a place of a scar.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:27.160]   May we know that we have a Christ who comes forward to us with his hands that still bear
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.040]   the marks of all the pain he endured.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:38.760]   And he says, "My pain for your healing, my death for your life, my cross for your carrying
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.640]   of it into newness of life."
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:48.080]   That's my prayer for us as a church as we step into this new year, post-traumatic growth.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:53.840]   May it be with us, upon us, and through us in the name of Jesus.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.400]   Let me pray for us.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:01.220]   Father, we are just so grateful that here we stand as a church together today.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.200]   And each one of us bears a story.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.480]   Each one of us carries something upon us.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.840]   And we do so in this moment of gravity as the beginning of the year.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.480]   We recognize we have some grave clothes that linger.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.480]   We recognize we have some wounds that still need to be healed.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.800]   But Lord, we don't start this year thinking about the worst case scenarios.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:29.520]   Father, we don't start this year tempted to hold ourselves back with a bit of timidity
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.520]   or uncertainty.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:35.000]   No, no, Lord, we choose faith over uncertainty.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.680]   We choose the reliance on the power of the Spirit of God over the brokenness that we
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.160]   so often feel.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:50.760]   Lord, we know that through the life of Josh, we are inspired ourselves to find new life
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.120]   even in the hardest of moments.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.320]   It's there that we come to you today.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.560]   And through this series over the next six weeks, we pray that Lord, you will bring new
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:05.680]   life and new fellowship and new growth and new transformation for all of us here at Divine
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.040]   Church, for all of us in this community.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:13.680]   I pray over every family, every marriage, over every relationship.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:18.680]   I pray over every business, those that are searching for employment, those that are in
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.840]   a difficult moment of poverty, Lord.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.760]   We stand in the places where each of our church are traveling right now.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.260]   And we pray, Lord, that you would turn our wounds into scars.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:34.760]   We pray, Lord, that you would walk us through it, Lord, that your presence would be with
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:41.200]   us manifesting your glory and your power in ways that we have never encountered before.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.600]   Lord, we choose to grow.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:52.440]   We choose to change, not in the power of positive thinking, but in the overwhelming majesty
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.040]   of your Spirit upon us.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:01.000]   Come Holy Spirit, come, fall afresh on us.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.960]   And may you bring us into the sons and daughters, as Josh wrote, that you had always planned
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.040]   us to be.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.040]   May it be for your glory, in Jesus' name.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.600]   Amen.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
