[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520]   Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Pastor Tim.
[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.000]   And thank you everyone for coming into church today.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   I'm really happy to see you at church.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.640]   I just was just telling my friend that
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.440]   remember the time when we had to worship alone
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.880]   in our house, in our apartment, facing the TV?
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.440]   Because it was pandemic, right?
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.240]   And everyone had to stay indoors
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.200]   and we had to worship on our own.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.360]   And there's no fun in it, actually.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.560]   The really enjoying part,
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.320]   but the really good part about worshiping
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.200]   is that when we all come together
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.880]   and all enjoy each other's singing.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.360]   And I think that every time I come to worship,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.280]   I just find it pure joy.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.000]   I can get to immerse myself into the music,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.040]   into the worship and just praise God.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.880]   And there's nothing more wonderful than that.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.760]   And I think every time when we talk about worship,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.640]   immediately think about the musical part, right?
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.800]   I wonder if you ever thought about
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.920]   why every time people talk about,
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.000]   "Let's worship God," you go,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.520]   "Okay, I'm ready to sing,"
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.480]   or "I'm not ready to sing."
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.560]   Singing is very integral, very important
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.000]   in the worship part because it engages our whole body,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.200]   our whole being.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.360]   You actually physically have to stand up
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.800]   and move and to worship.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.960]   You engage yourself emotionally
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320]   when you think about God, the glory of God,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.680]   and you want to express your adoration
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.800]   and your love to God.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.280]   Also, sometimes you also have to engage your mind
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.960]   to think about what was being sung.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.040]   And you can join in with the worship team
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.240]   to sing something beautiful.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.440]   My friend once told me that after the Sunday service,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.560]   what really stuck in their mind was not the sermon,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.720]   but what was sung during the worship.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.720]   The music, the lyrics actually accompany them
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.680]   throughout the week.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.520]   It was not so much about the sermon,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.440]   but the music really gets into your heart.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440]   And I've got to be honest with you,
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.000]   there was a season in my life
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   where I loved singing so much
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.440]   that I put all my energy, all my heart,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.160]   and all my soul into worship.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   And then after the worship part,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.640]   I just fell back into my chair and go,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.120]   I cannot do this anymore.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.920]   And I find it very difficult to connect with the sermon,
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.000]   to connect with the announcement later on,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.960]   because it just took all of my energy
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.040]   and all of my engagement into the singing part.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.760]   But this is not what I want.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.040]   I want to link the effort, the concentration,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.560]   and the enjoyment I have in the music part
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.480]   of the worship to the rest of the Sunday service.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.120]   Not only that, I want the same commitment,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.920]   the same zeal and passion into my work,
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.960]   my home, my relationships,
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.920]   because I know that worship is not just the music.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.600]   It's not the moment.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.080]   It's supposed to be the way I live.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.640]   How can this transformative worship
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   that we have experienced empower us
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.520]   to live a life of worship?
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.720]   We are going back to the book of Isaiah today.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.000]   Isaiah was one of the major prophets in the Old Testament.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.640]   This was the turbulence time when Isaiah was prophesying,
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.480]   because there was such a lot going on in Israel.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.560]   At that time, Israel was already split into two,
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400]   and Isaiah was looking after a prophesying
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.240]   in the northern part of the Israel called Judah.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.680]   And so let's read Isaiah 6, chapter one,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.560]   verse one together.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.200]   In the year of the king Uzziah died,
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.040]   I saw the Lord high and exalted,
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.480]   seating on a throne.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.400]   This is an important thing to note.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.240]   The encounter happened during the time
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.680]   when king Uzziah died.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.560]   King Uzziah was a good and wise king.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.880]   He reigned for about 52 years
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.480]   in the northern kingdom during Israel's split,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   providing a long period of time
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.120]   of stability and prosperity for Judah.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.160]   He also lead Judah into military victories
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.640]   over the Philistines and other neighboring nations.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.160]   In 2 Kings, chapter 15, verse three,
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.760]   the Bible says that he did what was right
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.480]   in the sight of the Lord.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.040]   So to say in the year that king Uzziah died
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.960]   waited a lot in Isaiah's heart.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.360]   Uzziah wasn't perfect, but he was compared,
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.440]   but he was very good compared to the kings before them
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   who always swing between obedience and idolatry.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.080]   Uzziah brought spiritual revival to Israel
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.760]   with his dedication to worship God.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.720]   Now that Uzziah died,
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.200]   who is going to lead Israel after him?
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.000]   Who's going to continue this obedience to God
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.200]   after Uzziah?
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.400]   Isaiah was worried and he was disheartened
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.960]   and he was confused.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.360]   What is going to become of the future of Israel
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.160]   when this king died?
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.760]   And this is the moment when God encounter,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.840]   let Uzziah to encounter him.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.560]   This was the moment when Isaiah was feeling weighted down,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.960]   when he was feeling confused and remorse
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.280]   over the diseased king and hung his hope on the new one,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.200]   God showed himself to Isaiah.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.160]   High and exalted, as the verse continues to say,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.480]   high and exalted, sitting on a throne,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.720]   with the train of his rope, fill the temple.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.160]   Above him were seraphims, each with six wings.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.560]   With two wings, they covered their faces
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.920]   and two, they covered their feet
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.720]   and two, they were flying
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.760]   and they were calling to each other,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   holy, holy, holy is the Lord almighty.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.480]   The whole earth is filled with his glory.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.120]   At the sound of their voices,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.200]   the doorsteps and the trash hole shook
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.560]   and the temples were filled with smoke.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.200]   God showed Uzziah,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.400]   God showed Isaiah who the real king was,
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.120]   who the real king was.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.160]   Not only that, God make sure
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.720]   that this is not on a cognitive level
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.640]   where Isaiah will go, okay, this is,
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.240]   I know that God is great, I know that God is big.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.200]   No, he let Isaiah to experience his greatness.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.560]   Look at the description on the verses.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.400]   It didn't say that God is big
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.160]   and then he just looked at it.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.440]   It described that Isaiah saw the train of the rope
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.640]   fill the temple and this is not the temple of the size.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.520]   Imagine that the rope of God's rope
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.280]   fill the whole street of this street.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.720]   You will really have to lift up your head
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.920]   and to see this magnificent God.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.880]   The sight itself is very overwhelming
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.440]   and then it continued to say
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.640]   that the sound of the seraphim singing
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.520]   shook the threshold and the temple itself.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.440]   And the way that this sound is big
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.040]   is not just hearing it, but it was being felt.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.960]   And this enormous, glorious God that Isaiah see,
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.120]   it's overwhelming him.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.720]   And he sees this God, not only that he is big in itself,
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.720]   but he is actually, he's actually the Lord sovereign God.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.080]   And so it puts Isaiah's grief into perspective.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.640]   When God encountered Isaiah,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.440]   Uzziah didn't come back to life.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.200]   The confusion, the sadness, everything didn't vanish,
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.160]   but Isaiah's faith grew.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.080]   Isaiah's faith grew because he saw God for who he is.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.640]   He is the real king.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.720]   He is the everlasting king.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.160]   That the mortal kings comes and go,
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.080]   but this is the king that is going to stay.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.240]   He's the king that whatever he said
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.440]   is going to come alive.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.480]   Whatever he's gonna do is going to come through.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.880]   So no matter who, which king comes after him,
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.200]   the king that Isaiah worshiped
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.840]   is going to reign forever and ever.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.080]   And this sense, it's revelation of God,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.960]   this awesomeness that Isaiah experienced
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.480]   led him to know that,
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.120]   led him to know that this is the king
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.640]   that I need to worship.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.760]   And so God showed Isaiah that he need not be confused
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.640]   and nervous about the future,
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.040]   that God reigns.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.120]   Uzziah might have died,
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.720]   but God revealed to Isaiah
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.960]   that he is the everlasting king.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.520]   The revelation of who God is
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.440]   has put Isaiah's grief into perspective.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.640]   And then the third film,
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.400]   that is the angel singing,
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.320]   plays a significant role in this narrative.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.560]   They were singing, "Holy, holy, holy."
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.800]   The meaning of the word actually is to set apart.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.280]   This apartness is not only the difference
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.720]   in height or in power,
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.360]   he is also set apart from all that is evil,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.880]   sinful, unclean, and impure in this world.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.720]   What happens when you encounter this holiness?
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.760]   You realize how sinful you are.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.360]   The easiest way to understand this is my white trainers.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.480]   I thought my trainers were white,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.520]   but then when I compare it to someone
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.080]   that just bought their trainers,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.680]   I know that mine fail in comparison.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.240]   It's pale yellow.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.960]   It's really yucky color, right?
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.280]   Our understanding of a clean and upright life
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.560]   cannot be compared to the holiness of God.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.200]   And so what did Isaiah do when God revealed himself,
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.400]   showed himself to him that way?
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.600]   Isaiah cried, "Woe to me, I am ruined,
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.760]   "for I'm a man of unclean lips,
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.280]   "and I live among a people of unclean lips,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.880]   "and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty."
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.560]   In the message translation, he puts it this way,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.960]   "Doom, it's doomsday, I'm as good as dead.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.080]   "Every word I've spoken is tainted, blasphemous even."
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.160]   At the sight of this holy Lord,
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   Isaiah felt painful at the sinfulness and confessed his sin.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.440]   This was not a script that he knew
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.840]   that he needed to recite, nor this is the flow,
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.000]   worship is not a flow or a script that he needs to follow.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.920]   This is his honest reaction to confess his sin,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.440]   to repent when he meets the Holy One.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.680]   Worship is not a script.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.320]   Worship is our response when God reveals himself.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.480]   I don't know if you've ever experienced this.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.360]   Maybe you come into worship and you praise,
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.320]   but then suddenly the sense of God's holiness
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.480]   just overcomes you and you can't sing anymore.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.720]   But you have to do something to respond
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.280]   to what God was saying to you at that moment.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.880]   And so whether it's crying or praying
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.680]   or kneeling down to confess,
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.000]   you were worshiping at the beginning,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.800]   but then you went into a deeper level of worship
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.440]   because of what was revealed to you.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.200]   True worship is not about saying the right thing
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.120]   and moving the right way.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.160]   True worship is the response we make
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.320]   when our hearts are moved by his revelation.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.240]   Isaiah sees God as King of Kings
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.120]   and he sees God as the Holy One.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.760]   His whole body, mind and soul was captured
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.120]   by God's revelation of himself.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.000]   His reaction was to lower himself and confess his sin.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.200]   And that is his worship to God.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.320]   Worship is the response we make
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.400]   when our hearts are moved by his revelation.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.280]   So what do you see when you worship?
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.480]   What do you focus on when you step into the space?
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.720]   Do you see the band sometimes and just admire them?
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.520]   Do you see others and think about
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.760]   the relationship you have with them?
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.120]   Maybe you have friends here and you step into the space
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.080]   and you really wanted to connect with your friends.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.400]   Do you see yourself out of place maybe,
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.920]   trying to fit in or do what every other one is doing
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.840]   and try to worship as others worship?
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.600]   I remember the first time when I stepped
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.520]   into the Fine Wan Chai.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.040]   The worship team was singing the most upbeat song,
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.840]   trying to get everyone's focus
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.760]   and to celebrate God's goodness.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.680]   And I just stepped into the church that time
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.840]   feeling very downhearted.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   I just came out of a church that they,
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.040]   normally they always told me to sing louder
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.760]   and be more hyped because I need to show
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.520]   a really good example to the people that is behind me.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.560]   I step out of that kind of work, righteous behavior,
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.760]   knowing that I need to do something for the church.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.880]   I need to do something for God to show that I love him.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.080]   But when I step into that atmosphere,
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.520]   when I step into the space and hear the song singing,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.840]   God's love never runs out on you.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.080]   His love is forever and he is great and awesome.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.320]   My heart was not going upbeat and saying
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.800]   happy, clappy songs.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.080]   My heart actually was broken
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.440]   because I know that the love of God
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.960]   comes and fills into my heart and I just started crying.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.720]   My worship wasn't the songs that I sing.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.240]   My worship was not the way that I posture myself.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.800]   My worship is the way I broke down
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.640]   and I told God that I can't sing anymore.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.920]   My heart is not ready yet, but my tears are coming out
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.040]   because I know your love for me is real.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.440]   And I just want to tell you,
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.440]   when you come into the space today,
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.080]   when you come in and you see friends
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.720]   and you see the team and you see
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.040]   everything happening so wonderfully,
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.680]   also take a moment to see what God is talking to you.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.160]   What is he showing you and revealing to you?
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.600]   When we say that true worship
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.840]   is not about saying the right thing,
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.200]   when we say true worship is the response we make,
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.120]   when our hearts are moved by his revelation,
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   what is he revealing to you today?
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.920]   Is he telling you about his holiness?
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.480]   Is he telling you about his greatness?
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.520]   How is your heart moved today?
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:08.280]   Let's keep going and read Isaiah chapter six,
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.320]   verse six to seven.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.880]   Then one of the seraphim flew to me
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.080]   with a life-cold in his hand,
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.280]   which he had taken from tongs from the altar.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.080]   When he, with it, he touched my mouth and said,
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.920]   "See, this has touched your lips.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.080]   "Your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for."
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:34.440]   Isaiah is rightly afraid of the fire of the Lord
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.040]   that will lash out against him.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.960]   He specifically feel the corruption of his tongue,
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.320]   the very instrument of his prophetic ministry.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.640]   And he feels the corruption of his people as well.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.800]   But the Lord of glory is also the Lord of grace.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.960]   And instead of killing the sinner that he deserves,
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.640]   he reveals his mercy to Isaiah.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.880]   As the angel touched Isaiah's lips with the life-cold,
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.320]   it said, "See, this has touched your lips.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.760]   "Your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for."
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.080]   Not because Isaiah said the right thing
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.880]   or he did anything to deserve this,
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.400]   nor could he do anything that he could fix his past
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.720]   and get his relationship right with God again.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.600]   This is totally God's doing, totally God's extending,
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.120]   actively extending his mercy and grace to Isaiah.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.560]   So what do you do when forgiveness of your sin
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   and offenses is offered freely like that?
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.640]   How do you respond?
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.040]   Maybe you could remember a time when you encountered God
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.440]   and you became aware of your sin,
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.280]   but God also extends his grace and forgiveness to you.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.360]   And what did you do?
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.520]   You accepted, you can only accept it.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.320]   And you say, "Thank you, God.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.560]   "I need this forgiveness, thank you."
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.080]   And the response is worship, and that is worship.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.800]   No music, no scripted lines,
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.080]   but when our hearts is moved by God's revelation,
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.680]   our response to him, to honor him,
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.160]   to acknowledge him is worship.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.640]   And when our response is our worship to God,
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.440]   then we're not only worshiping when we're singing,
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.880]   we worship when we see God in prayers,
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.880]   we worship by responding by amen.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.240]   When we see God in the preaching of the word
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.360]   and we take it to heart and think about it
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.840]   and we pray for each other, that is worshiping.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.360]   And when the seeing and responding doesn't stop here,
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.520]   the amazing thing is as when we step out of this door
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.520]   and into the world and we see God's loving heart,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.400]   we see God's mercy in this world,
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.600]   we see what God wants to do in this world,
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.200]   and we partner with God to respond to it that way
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.760]   by loving our neighbors,
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.400]   by serving and diligently in our workplaces,
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.600]   by healing and restoring relationship,
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.240]   trying our best to forgive or ask for forgiveness,
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.720]   we are worshiping God.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.760]   And so we are worshiping God when we respond to him
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.640]   inside and outside of this church,
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.280]   on Sunday and every other day of the week,
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.840]   because he is worthy.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.160]   And so in verse eight, when God reveals his will to Isaiah,
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.560]   he responded.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.320]   And so let's look at the scripture together.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.760]   In verse eight it says,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.480]   "Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying,
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.600]   'Whom shall I send and who will go for us?'
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.080]   And I say, 'Here am I, send me.'"
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.720]   Maybe you've been posed by this question before.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.880]   There is always so much to do here and there.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.520]   And maybe there are times when you put your hands up
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.960]   because you see the need in teams and ministries.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.000]   And for that, I thank you very much
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.640]   from the bottom of our hearts.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.080]   We are so grateful for that
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.280]   because this church can only do what churches should do
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.000]   because of your contribution,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.560]   because that you see the need
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.120]   and you respond to the need or our invitation.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.480]   And I can see that many of you
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.480]   are actually serving in different teams
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.360]   and not only serving in teams,
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.640]   the fact that you're coming into this church today
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.640]   is serving each other.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.160]   And I just really am so thankful for that.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.840]   In the morning session, when I was talking to a friend,
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.680]   he just came back from a really big surgery.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.040]   He had a big event, had a big surgery,
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.240]   and he came back and he said,
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.160]   "I am so touched by the fact that my brothers and sisters,
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.720]   my family in this church remembers me,
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.200]   smiled at me, and just to be with me."
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.440]   He was so lonely when he was worshiping
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.560]   in this hospital and at home,
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.840]   but when he come back and we see chairs are being filled,
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.120]   he sees that the family of Christ coming together,
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.640]   it heals his heart.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.440]   And your service to God is not just the things that you do,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.240]   but because of who you are,
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.160]   that you need to recognize that you are saved by God.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.680]   And the fact that you step into church today,
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.080]   worshiping together,
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.920]   is your response to God's calling in your life.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.680]   But I hope that as you continue to serve,
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.120]   as you continue to move,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.760]   we realize the ultimate reason that we serve
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.400]   is not because we're answering to someone's invitation,
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.720]   that we're coming here to serve,
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.800]   not because we see the needs and we need to fulfill it.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.320]   It's because you see the revelation of God
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.560]   moving in your heart,
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.480]   that you are not responding to people,
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.600]   but you're responding to God.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.520]   In the past, I used to play piano.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.480]   I used to know how to play piano.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.680]   So because of that, my church,
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.000]   I've been to a few churches,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.480]   and the churches always ask me to play piano,
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.240]   and it just makes me so stressed and in such pain.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.280]   I don't really like playing the piano.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.840]   I'm very bad at it.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.360]   But when they ask, they say,
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.680]   "June, but you're the only person
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.240]   "that can play the piano now.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.400]   "So you have to step up and play."
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.480]   And I step up, but I have a grudge in my heart.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.360]   You know, he had grade A piano too.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.040]   She went to that competition and he won something.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.160]   Why don't they serve?
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.840]   Why is it always me?
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.160]   And I carry that to serve.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.200]   And although it went well,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.120]   although the church was built,
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.320]   my heart is always have a slight scrunch, right?
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.160]   And it's not because of the church invitation.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.240]   It's actually because how I see my service.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.400]   I see that I'm fulfilling a spot.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.440]   I'm fulfilling someone's expectation, and so I serve.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.800]   And so the joy was taken out of me.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.040]   Fast forward to the Vine, right?
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.320]   Oh, so that's not the end of the story.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.840]   How did I get out of it?
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.120]   I had this really expensive piano at home.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.200]   I used to, okay, I had this really expensive piano at home.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:05.160]   To get out of serving in churches, I just give it away.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.360]   I didn't even wait to sell it.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.520]   I just, "Here you go.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.920]   "I have no piano at home right now.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.840]   "Please don't ask me to play anymore."
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.280]   And so that's the end of my musical career in piano.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.840]   But then fast forward to the Vine Yunlong,
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.520]   the startup of the Vine Yunlong.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.320]   There was a time when the worship team
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:29.320]   has only one musical player, musician.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.000]   And he was trying really hard to play
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.400]   on every single services, right?
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.480]   It's not just a Sunday service at that time.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.960]   There were Alva, there were lots of going on,
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.160]   and he is the only one.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.320]   And I'm also on the team.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.200]   I was singing at that time.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:49.200]   And because I want to communicate better with the musician,
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.280]   I actually took back piano lessons again.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.720]   And so, don't you...
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.280]   (laughs)
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.440]   I'm so glad that there's a full team all the time right now.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.440]   They still need people,
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.000]   but I know that I don't need to depend on.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.320]   But I'm just going to say that when I respond,
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.440]   when you see God's heart in you,
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.840]   when you see God's revelation to you,
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.720]   that you will step up to serve
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.760]   no matter how challenging it is or how difficult it is.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.200]   Because you will then find the strength to serve.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.600]   Then you'll find the joy to serve.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.200]   And that is totally different.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.000]   And I don't even, I don't just,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.040]   this is just my example, by the way.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.160]   I can see lots of brothers and sisters
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.040]   and people coming to this church here
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.600]   have that same compassion, have that same zeal.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.880]   Just yesterday, Amshanti has this back to school drive
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.560]   where they need people to donate
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.720]   because there are people who don't have
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.640]   enough resources for school.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.000]   Not only people in this church donate
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.600]   to this back to school drive,
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.080]   they actually go and start giving out
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.200]   and loving on the people that need these resources.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.760]   And I just want to say they don't do this
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.440]   because they are responding to people's invitation,
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.600]   because they receive God's mercy and God's grace,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.480]   and they want to share it that way.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.440]   And I want to talk about the impact that it has.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.440]   So last time when we were in our monthly prayer meeting,
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.840]   we prayed specifically for Shanti.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.120]   And they were sharing that the kids there,
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.920]   the kids that goes to Shanti,
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.360]   sometimes they feel the bully or the discrimination
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.040]   from their community, in the schools that they're in,
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.160]   or in the neighborhood that they're in.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.160]   And the fact that we go as a community in their community
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   to go and love for them, to pray for them,
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.040]   not only they're getting the resources,
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.640]   not only they're hearing the words of God,
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.400]   but they're actually feeling the embrace,
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.720]   the love from this community
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.280]   that they have received hurt from,
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.840]   the Hong Kong community maybe,
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.280]   or the schools that they are in,
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.800]   that they have experienced this discrimination.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.360]   But because of us going, because of us loving there,
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.320]   something shifted and something broke out.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.800]   And I'm just so thankful for the people
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.640]   that responded to God's call,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.960]   that they see that they've received God's love,
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.760]   and then they spread it out, and then they pour it in.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.200]   And that's worship.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.120]   Worship is not the songs that we sing here,
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.520]   but worship is the way that we respond
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.440]   when we see the revelation of God's love
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.600]   and holiness into our lives.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.960]   And so,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.320]   at the beginning of the worship series,
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.960]   Pastor Chapman talked about Romans 12, verse one.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.240]   "In view of God's mercy,
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.160]   "offer your bodies as living sacrifices,
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.680]   "holy and acceptable to God."
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.720]   Doesn't it sound familiar
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.600]   with what we talked about in Isaiah today?
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.240]   Paul is saying, do you see God's mercy?
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.680]   Do you receive this revelation?
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.880]   If you do, respond to it by living for God.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.160]   And so, if we do that, if we receive and respond
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.320]   in our communities, in our homes, in our workplaces,
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.160]   we're all actually moving temples.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.360]   That we're not just coming here and worship
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.760]   and then go back to our lives.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.000]   We're actually bringing a part of the temple
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   into our workplace, into the broken relationships,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   into the schools, into the neighborhood that we are in,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.280]   so that people can come and see the God
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.960]   that revealed Himself.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.280]   That people, through the way that we serve,
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.800]   can see the way that God loves,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.640]   and they can come and see this God.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.400]   And so, I urge you,
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.920]   in revelation, in view of God's love to you,
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.120]   in view of God's mercy to you,
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.040]   come and respond to it.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.320]   Maybe you don't have to respond by singing.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.400]   Maybe you are responding
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.120]   by extending your forgiveness to people.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.440]   Maybe you are responding by asking for forgiveness.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.960]   Maybe you're responding
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.240]   by just doing a really good job at work,
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.760]   because you know that you are set apart.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.480]   The way that your colleagues work, maybe don't cut it.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.160]   Maybe it's not the right way,
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.560]   even though every single one is doing it.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.400]   But you come into work and you say, "I am set apart,
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.520]   and I'm going to respond to God that way in my workplace."
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.400]   It may not be the most efficient.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.960]   It may not be the most profitable,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.480]   but this is how I'm going to see myself,
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.160]   because I see that God is holy.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.120]   Maybe you step into your school,
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.800]   knowing that, "I know I'm not going to be the popular kid,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.200]   but I want to step into this school knowing that God loves me,
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.880]   and I want to love those unpopular ones.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.480]   I want to extend this friendly hand,
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.760]   this friendliness to the people that often,
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:52.240]   you know, I don't really see eye to eye with."
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:57.600]   Receive God's revelation, church, in our worship today.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.200]   That's why we come.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.240]   That's why we gather.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.120]   We gather not to spend our morning together.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.360]   We come to spend our time together,
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:13.400]   so that when we go out, we carry this revelation with us.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.120]   And I want to invite the worship team to come back up again.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.240]   And as we step into this worship time,
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.120]   in response to what God has been revealing to us today,
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.440]   I want you to open your hearts.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.280]   I want you to open your hearts and ask God,
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.600]   "What have you revealed to me today in church?
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.720]   What part of you do I see?
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.080]   And how do you want me to respond to you?"
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.200]   And so I'm going to let the worship team
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.560]   to lead us into a part of worship,
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.280]   and let's all stand and worship.
