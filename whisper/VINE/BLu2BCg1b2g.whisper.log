[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   Hey, all right. Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.340]   Hey, Andrew. Hi, everyone else watching online.
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.960]   Surprise, church. Good morning.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.380]   Surprise.
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.760]   Yeah, like Carla said, Andrew, we'll keep praying for you.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.420]   Hope you're getting better.
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.840]   But hopefully for us this morning, it'll be a pleasant surprise.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.840]   You know the kind of surprises like
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.380]   sometimes when you haven't worn a pair of jeans or jacket for a while
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.180]   and you put it on, you dig through the pockets like,
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.920]   "Hey, 50 bucks." You know, that's pretty cool, right?
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.800]   That's the kind of vibe we're going for today.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.260]   So hopefully, we'll see how things go, okay?
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.800]   There are some things in life that when we look at,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.420]   at first glances, they seem a certain way.
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.300]   But when we go a little bit deeper,
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.420]   we see that actually things aren't quite what we realize.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.460]   You know, it's not quite what they seem.
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.840]   I myself am a good example of this.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.800]   Let me explain.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.460]   People often have a hard time trying to figure out where I'm from
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.380]   or what my ethnicity is.
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.140]   I mean, obviously, I'm not white, okay? I'm not black.
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.960]   But apart from that, people have a hard time
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.040]   trying to figure out where I'm from.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.300]   So for example, when I go to visit my wife's family,
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.300]   they live in a small town in Texas, people think I'm Mexican.
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.040]   There's not many Asians around, so people think I'm Mexican.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.800]   There's lots of Mexican community there, not many Asians,
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.040]   so people think I'm a Mexican in Mount Pleasant, Texas.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.960]   But I'm traveling around Asia.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.720]   I remember when I used to travel and do things like that.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.840]   I just seem to blend in to the country that I'm visiting.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.340]   I mean, even here in Hong Kong, people often ask me,
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.340]   "Are you Chinese?"
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.800]   Other Chinese people will ask me, "Are you Chinese? Where are you from?"
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.420]   And they will approach me in English, apart from in Cantonese,
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.720]   instead of in Cantonese.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.540]   Sometimes I think it's a spiritual gift.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.300]   In 1 Corinthians, Paul tells us that we become all things to all people
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.540]   so that we may save some.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.300]   But the title I like to give myself -
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.800]   you know there's a song called "The Secret Agent Man"?
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   It's quite old, OK?
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.300]   I like to call myself "The Secret Asian Man,"
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.300]   because nobody really knows where I'm from.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.040]   But it often also gets me in trouble.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.540]   Because when I travel, when we used to travel,
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.300]   I used to like to learn a few phrases of the local language
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.540]   to try and blend in even more.
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.300]   And I like to try to actually purposely pretend like I'm a local.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.040]   And my wife hates it when I do this.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.300]   "You're not a local, why are you pretending?"
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.300]   She hates it, which is why I do it even more, OK?
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.040]   It just annoys her to no end.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.300]   It's quite funny to watch.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   But let's say we're walking around in the Philippines or in Thailand,
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.040]   and we bump into a local person.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.040]   I'll just be polite and do a greeting.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.300]   "Sawadee ka," "Makka namo maga,"
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.540]   the little few phrases I know.
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.540]   And because they think I'm a local, they'll respond.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.540]   And then after that, it's like, "Yes, OK, this works."
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.540]   So I'll throw in another few phrases.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.540]   Then they really think I'm a local, and they start talking to me,
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.540]   engaging in me, and I'm just standing there like, "Mm-hmm.
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.040]   Yep, yep, yep, I have no idea what you're saying."
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.540]   And then I can't carry on the conversation anymore.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.040]   And then the person often walks away with thinking I'm an idiot,
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.540]   and it's like, "What's this guy doing? He doesn't speak.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.540]   Like, who is this guy?"
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.040]   But here's the problem.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   Sometimes I think we have this issue within church and the community.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.540]   Because often Christian community can look a certain way
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.540]   or have a certain reputation to it.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.540]   And on the surface, right, the church, Christians,
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.040]   we might seem like a group of people,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.540]   we have everything all well and put together.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.040]   We are deeply connected with God.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.040]   We have these deep roots with God and deeply rooted with each other.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   We have great faith, we have no worries, we have no pains.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.540]   We gather around on a Sunday to worship God,
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.040]   and when the right songs are being played and the sermon is good,
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.540]   we really have a good Sunday experience together.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.540]   But we just have to look a little bit deeper,
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.040]   just peel behind the curtain a little bit,
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   and we find out actually often this isn't what Christian community is like.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.040]   Under the surface, we're often so caught up in our own lives
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.540]   that we have no time to connect with God.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.540]   We really have no time to connect with each other.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.540]   And because we're not connected with God,
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.540]   we don't know how to take care of ourselves,
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.540]   we don't know how to take care of the community around us,
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.540]   and as a result, our relationships suffer,
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.540]   and we remain shallow, and even maybe you can use the word "fickle"
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.540]   in the way we approach life and our relationships.
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.540]   Maybe you can think about it this way.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.540]   If at some point today you might have already done this,
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.540]   you walk past someone, you say the obligatory,
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.540]   "Hey, how's it going? Hey, how are you?"
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.540]   Now, you can probably already guess the small talk
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.540]   that's going to come right after this question.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.540]   It's really a multiple choice thing, right?
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.540]   It's either good, great, fine.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.540]   If you're not doing well, you say, "I'm fine," okay?
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.540]   Or you get the classic, "I'm so busy."
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.540]   "Thank you."
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.540]   But what if someone actually took that as an invitation
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.540]   to express their feelings?
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.540]   How would you actually react?
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.540]   I feel like we would be a bit stuck.
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.540]   I know even as a pastor, I would be a bit stuck.
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.540]   We would think it's kind of weird.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.540]   And what if you said, "Hey, how are you going?
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.540]   How's it going?"
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.540]   Their reply was, "Actually, you know what?
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.540]   Man, I've had a really tough week.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.540]   Like, I have a gambling addiction,
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.540]   and I bet a whole bunch of money on the Euros,
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.540]   and now I don't know what to do because I lost."
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.540]   Or you say, "Hey, how's it going?"
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.540]   You say, "How am I? I'm terrible.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.540]   I lost my job this week,
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.540]   and I think my marriage is about to fail."
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.540]   What would we say? What would we do?
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.540]   I really don't know.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.540]   I mean, and also probably depending on the time,
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.540]   we'd probably be like, "Dude, what are you doing?
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.540]   Like, I have a lunch appointment after this service.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.540]   Okay, you're unloading your problems on me.
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.540]   I was just trying to be nice and courteous
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.540]   and say, 'How are you doing?
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.540]   Why are you unloading all your problems on me right now?'"
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.540]   What happens is then, the result of this
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.540]   is that we remain in a very surface level of life,
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.540]   and we don't want to get involved.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.540]   We don't want to know each other.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.540]   And so we just keep pretending like everything is fine
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.540]   without ever really getting to the deep, meaningful,
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.540]   rooted conversations that we need in our lives.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.540]   And the danger is we stay this way,
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.540]   and we get content to do life this way,
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.540]   because it's easier.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.540]   And because in general, this is how society functions.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.540]   I mean, there's a million and one things out there
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.540]   designed to keep our minds distracted,
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.540]   designed to make you feel like you're connected
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.540]   when really you're not connected at all.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.540]   And we don't take the time to look at our lives and our hearts.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.540]   I'm guilty of this all the time.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.540]   The moment we're bored, the moment we have some free time,
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.540]   maybe I'm just waiting to cross the road,
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.540]   waiting for the bus, sitting on the bus,
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.540]   waiting for my food, even sometimes riding on the lift, right?
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.540]   The instinct is to pull out your phone
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.540]   and just scroll through the news or your Instagram,
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.540]   whatever it is that you scroll through,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.540]   and you keep your mind distracted.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.540]   And you can't just blame millennials for this, okay?
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.540]   We millennials get out of stick for this.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.540]   It's not just millennials.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.540]   I see age groups, all age groups, all across the board
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.540]   doing this as a habit.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.540]   But church, this is a big problem.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   And it's a problem because we want to build
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.540]   the community of God, right?
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.540]   We say we want community and community groups
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.540]   where we can know and be known.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.540]   We're talking about river expressions,
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.540]   so we want the river expressions of this church
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.540]   to fit the contours of this land,
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.540]   to go out and meet the needs.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.540]   If we want to do those things,
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.540]   then we have to be willing to be connected
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.540]   and willing to go deep with ourselves,
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.540]   deep with God, and deep with others.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.540]   This is how we get to live life and life in the full,
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.540]   just as Jesus has promised us.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.540]   And this is especially important for a city like Hong Kong, I think,
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.540]   because, like I said, the way we function as a city,
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.540]   society, and culture in general
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.540]   is not geared towards deep connections.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.540]   Firstly, we are busy. I'll admit it.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.540]   Places to be, meetings to attend,
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.540]   deadlines with bosses chasing us,
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.540]   long hours of work.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.540]   And then we throw in this unhealthy culture
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.540]   of general suppressed expression of feelings.
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.540]   We don't talk about these things very much
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.540]   as a culture in general, right?
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.540]   Along with recent social unrest and political tensions
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.540]   and now the fear of, you know, "What can I say?
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.540]   What can't I say?
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.540]   Am I going to get in trouble for expressing myself?"
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.540]   This is, church, the perfect recipe
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.540]   for people to shut down, to disconnect,
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.540]   and to remain on the surface,
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.540]   because, like I said, it's easier, safer to live that way.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.540]   But again, this is why it's important,
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.540]   brothers and sisters.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.540]   We have an opportunity right now
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.540]   as a church, as a community,
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.540]   as followers of Jesus,
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.540]   to show the city that we were made,
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.540]   God designed us,
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.540]   for more than just shallow living and small talk.
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.540]   And through rooting our hearts deeply in God
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.540]   and in His design of how He wants us to live our lives,
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.540]   we create space.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.540]   We create a community, a family,
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.540]   where we can express ourselves deeply and fully
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.540]   as God desires for us to do.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.540]   We live in the freedom of being able to discover
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.540]   who God has created us to be.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.540]   And we don't have to hide from the hurt and the pain
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.540]   and the suffering that we go through,
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.540]   but rather, God invites us to learn the language
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.540]   of the broken,
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.540]   so we can fulfill the commandment of loving the Lord
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.540]   with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength,
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.540]   and loving others as we love ourselves.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.540]   So I want to invite you into a passage from Scripture
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.540]   because I hope that this might help us
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.540]   to understand a bit better
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.540]   just the initial steps of how to do this.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.540]   It's a big task,
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.540]   and we're not going to solve everything
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.540]   in one Sunday sermon or one Sunday service.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.540]   I know that.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.540]   But at least we're trying to take a good step
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.540]   in the first--a good first step in the right direction.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.540]   And we don't have any slides today.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.540]   We didn't have time to put up the slides,
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.540]   so you're going to have to pay attention
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.540]   and engage a little bit more.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.540]   I think there is this one slide of the passage
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.540]   that's coming up, Mark chapter 1.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.540]   You can look it up in your Bibles as well.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.540]   We're going to be in Mark chapter 1,
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.540]   starting in about verse 29.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.540]   Let me read it for us.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.540]   Scripture says this.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.540]   [Reading]
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.540]   [Reading]
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.540]   [Reading]
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.540]   [Reading]
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.540]   [Reading]
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.540]   [Reading]
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.540]   The gospel of Mark is a busy gospel.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.540]   If there was a gospel that could reflect the life of Hong Kong,
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.540]   I think it would be Mark, right?
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.540]   Because Mark gets straight--stuck in the action straight away.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.540]   We have John the Baptist in the desert
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.540]   proclaiming who Jesus is, right?
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:19.540]   This wild, crazy guy eating locusts and honey in the desert,
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.540]   screaming about the one who has come to save the world.
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.540]   And Jesus appears on the scene, gaining followers.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.540]   It tells us that he was going around on this preaching circuit, right?
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.540]   Teaching with authority like no one had ever heard before.
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.540]   And he was driving out demons, casting out demons.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.540]   Demons would be cast out at the sound of his voice.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.540]   And he also had this miraculous power of being able to heal people.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.540]   All the sick who were brought to him, Jesus was able to heal.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:55.540]   So news travels as he moves about.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.540]   And he's about to get to a town called Capernaum.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.540]   And so it creates a buzz, right?
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:04.540]   When someone like this rolls through town, it's going to create some buzz.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.540]   It's going to get a lot of attention.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.540]   Let's read it again.
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.540]   It tells us this.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.540]   Jesus had a busy day, okay?
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.540]   When it was evening after sunset, this is what happens.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.540]   "They brought to him all who were sick and demon-possessed,
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.540]   the whole town gathered by the door.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.540]   So he healed many who were sick with various diseases
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.540]   and drove out many demons.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:31.540]   But he would not permit the demons to speak because they knew him."
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:37.540]   We said just now, and we all know this church, that our city is a busy place.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:43.540]   But through this little story, it shows us that Jesus knew what it was like to be busy.
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.540]   I mean, he had just spent the whole day preaching, teaching, healing people,
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.540]   casting out demons, and they kept on coming to him.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.540]   Notice what the passage says.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.540]   "The whole town was gathered at the door."
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.540]   Now, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, perhaps, but it just means a lot of people.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.540]   The whole town, everybody who was looking for Jesus,
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.540]   was gathered at the door of where Jesus was staying.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.540]   People coming in droves, people with their problems, people with their sicknesses,
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.540]   coming, searching for Jesus to heal them.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.540]   Does that remind you of your life, perhaps?
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.540]   Maybe I should ask you this way.
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.540]   What is gathered at your door right now?
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.540]   For many of us in this city, our lives are fast-paced,
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.540]   and many people demanding lots of things from us.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.540]   And so maybe at your work, maybe it seems like sometimes the entire office
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.540]   is gathered at your door, demanding your work.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.540]   "Hey, where's that presentation?"
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.540]   "Hey, I asked you for this report a week ago. Where is it?
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.540]   Where are the figures? Can we have this meeting?"
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:55.540]   The whole office is gathered at your door, demanding your attention.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.540]   Or maybe here, your mom or dad, a caregiver at home, a domestic worker,
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.540]   looking after the kids, trying to look after the home, make meals,
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.540]   and it seems like all the household chores are just gathered at your door.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.540]   The work just never ends. There's always laundry, always dishes,
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.540]   always meals to be cooked, always kids to be looked after.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.540]   And it seems like everything is just gathered at your door.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.540]   Or maybe you're a student in here, and we know what student life is here, right?
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.540]   Every day it's homework, assignments, group projects,
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.540]   where there's always that one person who doesn't pull their weight, right?
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:37.540]   Extra classes, exams, tutors, all these things are gathered at your door.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.540]   Brothers and sisters, take heart.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.540]   Jesus knew what it was like to have people demanding things from Him.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:50.540]   Jesus knew what it was like to be busy, and He sees you in your busyness,
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.540]   and He empathizes and sympathizes with you.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.540]   But He also knew this.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:04.540]   Busyness is one of the key things that will keep our relationships shallow and surface level.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.540]   We get so focused on our to-do list and our meetings
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.540]   and the things that people are expecting us to do
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.540]   that we don't take time to reconnect, to recharge.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.540]   And so we walked about stressed out and grumpy.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.540]   Our busyness keeps our conversations so shallow, centered on work and getting things done,
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.540]   rather than having deep, meaningful, rich conversations
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.540]   about who we were created to be, what's on our hearts, what's on our minds.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:34.540]   And then we start to wonder, "Wow, why do I feel so lonely all the time?"
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.540]   Our busyness keeps our relationship with God shallow.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.540]   Maybe truly Sunday is the only day that you get to come and hear from the Bible,
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:49.540]   look at the Bible, worship, because once Monday kicks in, it's back to the grind again.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.540]   But look at this church.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.540]   When Jesus is faced with the entire town full of people demanding His attention,
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.540]   what does He do?
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.540]   It doesn't say Jesus downed three cups of coffee and just kept going.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.540]   It doesn't say He went out to get a few red bulls and just,
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.540]   "Okay, got the energy now, let's go."
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.540]   It doesn't say He shifted things around in His Google calendar and said,
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.540]   "Okay, you know, we have a paralytic here and a lame man here, a blind man.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:21.540]   Okay, maybe I can switch these few things around and I can fit in as many healings as I can today."
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.540]   He doesn't do that.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.540]   No, the Scripture tells us that, 1 Thirty-Five.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.540]   Jesus got up early in the morning when it was still very dark,
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.540]   departed and went out to a deserted place.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.540]   And there He spent time in prayer.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.540]   You see what Jesus does?
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.540]   Jesus doesn't let His demands dictate His response.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.540]   Instead, He reacts to these demands.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.540]   And He goes away all by Himself and He prays.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.540]   He purposely chooses to step away from the busyness of things
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.540]   so that He can focus on what is the most important thing,
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:04.540]   to recharge, to reconnect with His Father.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.540]   So, church, let me ask you this question.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:14.540]   When was the last time you went off to a place by yourself just to pray,
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.540]   just to spend time with God?
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.540]   When was the last time you actually took time to do that?
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:26.540]   In fact, if we look at the life of Jesus, this was a regular habit in His life.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:32.540]   It tells us all the time in the Gospels, Jesus went off to a solitary place by Himself to pray.
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.540]   And in doing so, Jesus demonstrates to us and to those who claim to follow Him
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.540]   that we need to do the same.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.540]   In order for us to be deeply rooted with anyone else, including ourselves,
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.540]   we first need to be rooted in God.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:53.540]   And we need these regular, dedicated times of solitary prayer in order to do that.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.540]   So this morning, church, I want to encourage you in this.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.540]   I mean, in many ways, I know this sounds like Sunday School 101,
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:08.540]   but I felt like this was one of the main things that God was asking to be reminded you guys of today.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.540]   The first step for us as a community to become more deeply rooted
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.540]   is that we need to commit to and encourage each other to eliminate busyness
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.540]   so that we can connect with God.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:25.540]   Because if Jesus found it necessary to do so, we need to as well.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.540]   So what happens next?
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:32.540]   Jesus goes off, gets some prayer, gets a bit of rest, and we expect Him to be ready to go back, right?
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.540]   Okay, you've got some rest now, Jesus. Let's go back.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.540]   Let's go back to the healing and the helping.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.540]   People are waiting for you.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.540]   At least this was the expectation of His disciples.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.540]   Listen to what it says.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.540]   "Simon and his companions searched for Him, and when they found Him, they said,
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.540]   'Everyone is looking for You.'"
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.540]   Everyone is looking for You.
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.540]   You can almost hear the judgment in their voice, right?
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.540]   Everyone is looking for You.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:05.540]   Actually, the word, the term "looking for You" here in the Greek actually means "hunting for You."
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.540]   Right?
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.540]   The people have been hunting for Jesus.
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.540]   Like, they want to bring Him back as a prey and bring Him back to their agenda.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.540]   Everyone is looking for You.
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.540]   What are you doing, Jesus?
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.540]   Why aren't you with the people?
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.540]   Don't you know people are waiting?
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.540]   Don't you know there's still loads of people that need to be healed?
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.540]   They've been waiting there all night.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.540]   You're just going to let them stay there?
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.540]   Come on. Come back, Jesus. Do your work.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.540]   This is essentially what the disciples were saying.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.540]   But again, I'm going to throw the question back out to you today.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.540]   Can you hear questions like this being asked of you?
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:50.540]   Do you wrestle with the expectations of other people and society?
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.540]   And it plays itself out in so many ways.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   Everyone needs you. Everyone needs you.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.540]   What are you doing?
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.540]   I mean, social media itself is a good example of this.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:04.540]   Full of images and expectations that we can never seem to match up to.
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.540]   We scroll through these pictures of people's highlight reels.
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.540]   Everyone looks great. Beautiful lives.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:13.540]   And we think, "Oh, man. I wish my life could be more like that."
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:19.540]   And so we try our very best to match up to these unrealistic expectations.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.540]   Or perhaps, like we talked about just now,
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.540]   it manifests in the way we communicate with each other.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.540]   And we hold back sharing our struggles
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.540]   because we're fearful about what other people might think.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.540]   We get nervous.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.540]   So if I really share what I'm struggling with,
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.540]   are people still going to want to connect with me?
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.540]   So when people ask, "Hey, how are you?"
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.540]   What we really want to say is, "I really need some help."
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.540]   But we don't want to be a burden. We don't want to get weird.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.540]   We don't want to do that stuff.
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.540]   And so we just keep it to ourselves and we say, "Yeah, I'm fine."
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.540]   Or maybe we become people pleasers.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.540]   And we say yes to everything that's demanded of us,
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.540]   even the things that we don't want to do.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.540]   This is totally me.
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.540]   I am always worrying about what other people think about me
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.540]   to the point where I actually think sometimes I begin to change myself
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.540]   in order to conform to other people's expectations.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.540]   And I end up doing and being a part of and taking part in many things
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.540]   that perhaps I don't actually want to do,
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.540]   but because I want to please people, I choose to say yes.
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.540]   So yeah, sure, I'll help you move house.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.540]   Yeah, sure, I'll come to your party.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.540]   Yeah, I can have lunch with you.
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.540]   Yeah, I can put a sermon together in less than a day, of course.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.540]   (Laughter)
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.540]   And then we have culture.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.540]   There's so many great qualities about Chinese and Asian culture,
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.540]   many which I'm grateful for.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.540]   But I don't know if you see it or feel it yourself.
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.540]   There is this underlying tension, right,
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.540]   of fulfilling the expectations of the older generation.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.540]   I mean, to this day, I consider myself a grown-up now,
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:05.540]   but to this day, if an older Chinese po-po or ba-ba asked me to do something,
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.540]   it's impossible for me to say no.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.540]   This guy could say, "Hey, can you take this bomb and move it over there?"
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.540]   And I'd be like, "Oh, sure, yeah, you're older than me.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.540]   I'll respect you and do it."
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.540]   Okay?
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.540]   I wrestle with that.
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:23.540]   And maybe on a more serious note, you and your family, right?
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:29.540]   You've always been governed and controlled by the things you're allowed to pursue.
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:34.540]   And the path that you're on right now is so far from what's really passionate
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.540]   about--you're passionate about in your heart.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.540]   And you've never really been given the freedom to explore these passions
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.540]   that you feel like God has given to you.
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:50.540]   The truth is, if we're always working towards what other people want us to do
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.540]   and completely ignoring their own desires and the dreams
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.540]   that God has put in our hearts and in our minds,
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.540]   it too will lead to shallow, surface-level lives.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:06.540]   Because we're constantly trying to measure up to other people's expectations,
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:12.540]   it's going to prevent us from being deeply rooted into who God created you to be.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.540]   And again, Jesus understands this.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.540]   And that's why He says to His disciples, when His disciples say,
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.540]   "Everyone is looking for you," Jesus' reply is,
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.540]   "Let's go somewhere else into the surrounding villages so I can preach there.
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:33.540]   For this is what I came here to do."
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.540]   You see the difference in perspective between Jesus and His disciples?
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:43.540]   Jesus takes a deeper perspective as to what's actually needed and what's happening.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.540]   The disciples can only see and react to what's right in front of them.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.540]   Yes, there's a crowd. Yes, there are people there that need Jesus' help.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.540]   But Jesus realizes His mission, His calling wasn't just to stay in one place,
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.540]   to become some sort of miracle hander/outer.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.540]   People just come to Him.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.540]   This is how some people back then worked.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.540]   There were these healers that would go to a town, they would set up shop there,
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.540]   people would come to them, and it would always be like a business.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.540]   You come to me, I do the healing, I make myself famous,
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.540]   and that's how I make my living, that's how I make my money.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.540]   But that wasn't Jesus' calling.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.540]   He wasn't there just to stay at one place.
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.540]   People come to Him to heal.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:31.540]   Jesus made it very clear that His mission on this earth was to come and preach the gospel.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:36.540]   So what the disciples see on the surface level, these crowds appearing,
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:40.540]   they see, hey, maybe we can take advantage of this situation.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.540]   But Jesus' mission was something else.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.540]   He was to preach the gospel to all of Israel,
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.540]   to declare God's kingdom here on earth as it is in heaven,
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.540]   to go to the cross, to die for our sins,
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.540]   raise from the dead, defeating the enemy,
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.540]   so that we can be reconciled with God.
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.540]   That was His purpose.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.540]   But the crowd and the disciples don't seem to understand that at the moment.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.540]   They just want the healing.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:12.540]   So Jesus steps away, confidently steps away,
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.540]   knowing He's doing the right thing,
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.540]   and He moves on, preaching the gospel.
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.540]   This made me pause and think,
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:26.540]   because this is, like I said, so far from how I would have responded.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.540]   It sounds like madness to me.
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.540]   As I was reading this passage, I thought to myself,
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.540]   wow, Jesus, aren't you?
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.540]   You're letting all these people down.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.540]   Why aren't you afraid of what other people are going to think of you?
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:44.540]   Wasn't Jesus worried that He was going to upset some people about His reputation?
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.540]   But He doesn't second-guess Himself.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:53.540]   He moves on because He knows what He came here to do.
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.540]   And so, brothers and sisters,
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.540]   this is another question I want to pose for you today.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.540]   What have you come here to do?
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.540]   Like, what have you--
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.540]   what do you feel like you have been put on this earth for?
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.540]   Carla said it just now.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.540]   There is no coincidences.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:16.540]   No one is on this earth by a coincidence or by an accident.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.540]   And if we don't figure this out,
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.540]   this is another one of those things that's going to stop us from able to be--
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.540]   stop us from being able to be deeply formed and deeply connected
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.540]   because we're not even sure what our purpose is.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.540]   And I'm not talking really about career or jobs or vacation here.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.540]   That's not what I'm really talking about.
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:40.540]   You can have a great, successful job, you know, doing really well in your field,
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:45.540]   but still feel that longing of, "What am I here for?"
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.540]   And I know this is a big question.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.540]   And maybe, you know, as I ask this, it's causing a lot of stress and anxiety
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.540]   because this is something that you've been wrestling with a long time now.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.540]   How do I figure out what's God's will for my life?
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.540]   What if I'm not living in it right now?
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.540]   What if I've missed the boat?
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:07.540]   Is God still able to use me?
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:12.540]   But on the other side, let's look at this from a different perspective.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.540]   May I suggest this?
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:20.540]   Perhaps these difficult, big, deep questions are exactly what we need
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:26.540]   to help us deepen our relationships with God and each other.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.540]   Perhaps these are the questions--
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.540]   these questions of calling and seeking God's will for our lives
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.540]   is something that we're not meant to do on our own.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.540]   Often I feel like we struggle with this by ourselves.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.540]   We go off and we pray and we say, you know,
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.540]   "God, what's your will for my life?"
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.540]   And we get all confused because there's so many different choices
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.540]   and we don't know what to do.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.540]   We don't know what direction to take.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:49.540]   But rather than wrestling with it all by yourself,
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.540]   maybe this is a question you can bring before your community,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.540]   your friends, your brothers, and your sisters.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:00.540]   And you can ask them, "Hey, what do you think God has called me to in my life?"
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.540]   And that opens up a much brighter and deeper conversation, doesn't it?
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.540]   Instead of just saying, "Hey, how are you?"
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:10.540]   So Hayden comes up to me and says, "What do you think God has called me to?"
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.540]   And I can look at Hayden because we know each other,
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.540]   and I can say, "Hayden, I see loyalty in you, Hayden."
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.540]   It's the first time I'm telling you this, right?
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:25.540]   "But I see in you, Hayden, a deep desire to help people feel loved and respected and known."
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.540]   And that's a gift God has given to you.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.540]   That makes for a much deeper conversation, much better conversation, doesn't it?
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:39.540]   Than, "Hey, how are you doing?" "I'm fine." "Okay, let's move on."
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:44.540]   So church, what are you here to do?
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.540]   And one of the key things we've all been called to
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.540]   is that we are all here to be image bearers of God.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.540]   You've been put here to be His salt and His light.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.540]   You're here to experience God's love,
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:05.540]   and now after experiencing His love, to show His love to other people.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:11.540]   That is a calling all of us in this room can live up to and follow.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:17.540]   So finally, like I said, Jesus steps away, and He continues on His mission.
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.540]   Mark says He leaves.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:27.540]   He went into all of Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and casting out demons.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:33.540]   And this is the mission now, church community, for us to do.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.540]   We have been called to do the same.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.540]   Once our hearts are rooted in deep, regular prayer with God,
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.540]   once we've figured out some way to take away some of the busyness,
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:49.540]   once we've figured out how to not fix our minds on people's expectations
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.540]   and really live up to what God has called us to do,
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.540]   our mission now is to root ourselves firmly in God,
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:01.540]   build communities, do the same by preaching the gospel.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:06.540]   We bring this message that life doesn't have to be shallow and surface,
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:15.540]   but rather we can experience fully what it means to live a life and life to the full.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:21.540]   And through this, through doing this, we too cast out demons and push back darkness
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:29.540]   because the enemy would like nothing more for us to continue living the way that we might be the easiest way.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:38.540]   Surface level, going through every day without ever truly connecting with ourselves, with God, or with anyone else.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:43.540]   But church, let's not be content with that.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.540]   That's not us.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.540]   That's not this community.
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:54.540]   And the challenge we've been given to is to go deep, but go deep together.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.540]   And like I said, we're not going to solve everything.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:01.540]   There's lots of things to work out, but let's take that first step in the right direction.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.540]   This means we're going to have to be willing to get vulnerable with each other.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:10.540]   This means we're going to have to be willing to embrace weaknesses and pain and hurt.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.540]   We're going to have to be very intentional with our language,
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:18.540]   asking better questions of each other other than just, "Hey, how are you?"
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:27.540]   But we trust that as we do this, it's the Spirit of God that's doing this work of formation in our lives,
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.540]   molding us, connecting us, rooting us in Him,
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:38.540]   so that we can go out and bring the gospel of hope and love that the world so desperately needs.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.540]   This is our call church.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.540]   And as Paul says in Ephesians 3,
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.540]   "As we do this, I pray that out of His glorious riches,
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.540]   He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being,
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.540]   so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:01.540]   And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.540]   may have power together with all the Lord's holy people
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:10.540]   to grasp how wide, how long, how high, and how deep is the love of Christ.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.540]   And to know that this love surpasses knowledge,
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.540]   and that you may be filled to the measure of the fullness of God.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:24.540]   Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than we ask or imagine,
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.540]   according to His power that is at work within us,
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:32.540]   to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations,
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:37.540]   forever and ever and ever. Amen.
