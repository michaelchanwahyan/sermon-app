1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Once I was traveling with dear friend to a certain place,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,380
 to be away from a most troubled context,

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,620
 reflecting on the significance

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,740
 and the puzzling circumstances of things.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,580
 At the time, I and my company

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,360
 could only identify discouragement and unbelief.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,180
 Then we met someone on the road, a stranger to us.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,900
 Somehow we caught up and chatted.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,220
 And rather unusual to my introvert's inclination,

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,740
 I actually expressed some of my profound discouragement.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,780
 At the long faith journey in Christ,

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,780
 in a lato of hopes of how the kingdom of God may manifest,

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,520
 and me as a believer in Christ,

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,360
 together with my fellow believers in the city,

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,500
 could be part of this.

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,520
 Yes, the circumstances and happenings

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,120
 seemingly dashed all such hopes.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,760
 Well, I least expected that this gentleman responded

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,240
 by rebuking us for our hardness of heart.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,100
 He even pointed us to the Bible

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,560
 concerning the manifestation of the kingdom.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,140
 We did another extraordinary thing.

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,440
 We invite him to join us for dinner,

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,500
 and there was a great time of fellowship.

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,940
 Then it dawned on us, well, that this person

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,120
 is no stranger.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,760
 We used to know him.

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,100
 That's why our hearts burned,

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,740
 even as we shared bread and the cries of our hearts.

30
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,980
 Somehow we find renewed hope,

31
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,740
 and actually decided to call off our departure,

32
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,200
 and return to where we came from,

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,440
 because we find new hope, new purposes.

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,440
 You may by now guess this stranger's name is Jesus.

35
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,440
 Luke chapter 24 recorded for us

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,640
 the account of two disciples

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,280
 going down the road to Emmaus.

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,400
 Cleopas and his company represented discouragement

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,780
 and unbelief of Jesus' followers.

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,840
 When they met Jesus on the road,

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,300
 his identity was somehow hidden from them,

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,600
 and they expressed their profound disappointment

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,860
 at the tragic events in the city of Jerusalem.

44
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,960
 They had hoped that he might be the Messiah

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,300
 who would redeem Israel,

46
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,160
 yet his death on the cross dashed all such hopes.

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,920
 Jesus responded by rebuking them

48
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,600
 for their hardness of heart.

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,800
 Did not the scriptures predict

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,900
 the suffering of the Messiah?

51
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,680
 Even though now equipped with the truths of the scripture,

52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,280
 the disciples did not recognize Jesus,

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,420
 until they invited him into fellowship

54
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,520
 around the dining table.

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,840
 Jesus broke bread,

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,820
 Jesus commune with them,

57
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,980
 and now they recognize Jesus.

58
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,180
 Jesus disappeared from their presence,

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,000
 and they joyfully returned to Jerusalem

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,140
 to report their experience.

61
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,460
 There they find the other disciples,

62
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,640
 announcing the same good news.

63
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,920
 Jesus is indeed a rise.

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,920
 I'm thankful for Andrew's invitation

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,360
 to share something from my heart.

66
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,680
 Please take me as a fellow brother in this congregation

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
 and from the internet.

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,260
 I'm hopeful what is laid in my heart

69
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,420
 also finds resonance in you.

70
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,900
 What I want to share from the scripture today

71
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,280
 is about my own reflections in church life

72
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,040
 and how we can best express it.

73
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,760
 It just happens that I have only attended

74
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,420
 three churches in my lifetime.

75
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,260
 10 years in a very local traditional Chinese church,

76
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,260
 and 10 years in the Assemblies of God Church in Singapore,

77
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,100
 and of course, 14 years here in the Vine.

78
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,360
 We got a bit more involved in church life

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,840
 as we participated in the first Chinese Alpha

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
 from 10 years ago.

81
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,000
 I want to reflect some of my concerns

82
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,280
 and my faith commitments, rooted, reach out, and renewal.

83
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,720
 Let's return to the Bible first.

84
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,780
 For Luke's readers, including us,

85
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,400
 basically this is a call to come out of the fog

86
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,960
 of disappointment that these two disciples left in two,

87
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,620
 and instead, dare to believe the promises of his word

88
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,440
 as we fellowship with Christ.

89
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,320
 Interestingly, there's an epilogue to this event.

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,300
 Jesus appeared again and fellowshiped with his disciples

91
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,880
 over the dining table in Jerusalem.

92
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,760
 Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?

93
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,060
 This is what I told you while I was still with you.

94
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,020
 Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me.

95
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,780
 And he opened their minds

96
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,520
 so that they could understand the scriptures.

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,100
 You are witnesses to all these things,

98
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,740
 and you will be closed with power from high above.

99
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,820
 Jesus is talking about the Holy Spirit and empowerment.

100
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,100
 And Jesus reveals himself

101
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,460
 while in table fellowship with his disciples.

102
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,960
 He is indeed at home in our midst, in our everyday activity.

103
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,220
 So how shall we apply all these scriptures into our life?

104
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,440
 What is my cry of the heart for my fellow brothers

105
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,880
 and sisters here in the vine?

106
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,200
 So I've mentioned the three R's.

107
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,840
 To be rooted deeply in his word,

108
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,600
 to reach out with fervor, and that is the mandate,

109
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,180
 and to renew our hearts, be connected with him.

110
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,400
 During the early days while we were still dating,

111
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,100
 and of course we are still dating,

112
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,520
 I loved writing letters to my then girlfriend

113
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,480
 and now my wife Vivian.

114
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,800
 Yes, love letters,

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,220
 so that I may express my love for her in writing.

116
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,500
 When we had a committed relationship,

117
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,000
 I actually gave her my diary.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,540
 I was open to her,

119
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,560
 and my story was passed on to her in writing.

120
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,160
 I would hope that she would read my love letters

121
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,260
 in my diary time and again,

122
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,620
 so that she would know me, and she would know my love for her.

123
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,120
 With some degree of similarity,

124
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,020
 God conveyed his love message to us in writing,

125
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,820
 so that we can read time and again.

126
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,000
 So David, the psalmist, encouraged us.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,580
 I'll hide your word in my heart

128
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,600
 that I would not sin against you.

129
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,420
 The biblical sense of knowing

130
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,800
 is actually to have an intimate relationship.

131
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,060
 It is just inconsistent if we say

132
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,060
 we want to know his plan for our lives,

133
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,180
 and yet somehow we remain complacent

134
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,460
 in trying and getting to know him.

135
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,860
 The yearning to know him more could differ

136
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,180
 depending on your own unique situation.

137
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,820
 I'm encouraged to know that many fellow brothers and sisters

138
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,200
 are committed to studies offered by,

139
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,160
 say for example, the Bible Study Fellowship,

140
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,080
 or other Bible study groups in your own community groups.

141
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,160
 But on the other hand, I'm sometimes frustrated

142
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,800
 that some of us hardly make an effort

143
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,860
 to allow his word to speak to us on a daily basis.

144
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,180
 Anyway, for me, at the age of 50,

145
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,020
 I did enroll for seminary studies

146
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,820
 as I desired to know him more.

147
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,380
 Yet, one of my greatest understanding of his word

148
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,260
 is when my own circumstances become so conflicting.

149
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,220
 The time point was at the second year

150
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,300
 of my five-year part-time study program.

151
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,720
 I was enthusiastic to be equipped for service.

152
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,660
 It was then that I was diagnosed with leukemia,

153
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,640
 a blood cancer.

154
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,560
 I struggled to reconcile the disruption to my plan.

155
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,260
 I was serving him through my second half of my life.

156
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,780
 And studying to know God's word

157
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,460
 become almost like a disillusion.

158
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,940
 What is the point of knowing him more

159
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,580
 when ultimately we shall know him in perfection?

160
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,720
 For now, we see only a reflection as in a mirror.

161
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,780
 Then we shall see him face to face.

162
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,000
 There is a dilemma.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,680
 So much needs to be done.

164
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 So many need to be served.

165
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,060
 And so much relationship to be treasured.

166
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,620
 And so did the time.

167
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,420
 It was at this point that his word brings clarity.

168
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,060
 There's new light as I read.

169
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,820
 For to me, to live is Christ.

170
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:34,500
 If I am to go on living in this body,

171
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,800
 in this body, this will mean fruitful labor for me.

172
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,360
 Somehow I find comfort that he knows best.

173
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,920
 There's a perfect timing in his plans.

174
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,420
 And by knowing him more, I actually learned

175
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,500
 to trust him more.

176
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,320
 I actually decided to bite the bullet

177
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,960
 and carried on with my studies

178
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,520
 and my own clinical practice.

179
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,120
 And at the same time, went through my chemotherapy

180
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,880
 treatment, which was spread over two years.

181
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,860
 Today I'm glad to report that I've graduated

182
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,960
 from the seminary.

183
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,100
 [audience applauding]

184
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,820
 And I have finished my treatment.

185
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,820
 [audience applauding]

186
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,740
 Now you don't have to go through seminary

187
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,420
 or chemotherapy to help you make a tough choice

188
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,680
 whether to study his word.

189
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,380
 You just need to make a commitment and do it.

190
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,740
 That daily application of God's word in our ordinary lives

191
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,280
 is exactly what God desires for all of us

192
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,660
 in the secular world.

193
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,760
 How about you?

194
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,120
 Knowing God's word through diligence studies

195
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,200
 will anchor you to face whatever lies ahead of you.

196
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,940
 It can be COVID, it can be losing a job,

197
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,480
 a relationship, or even a loved one.

198
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,180
 But his word will help us navigate

199
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,240
 the worst moments in life.

200
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
 Isn't that good news?

201
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,880
 Our knowing him should actually find a way

202
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,420
 of expressing through testifying.

203
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,440
 When we know him, we naturally want to share the good news.

204
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,300
 On the road to Emmaus, the two despondent

205
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,140
 disciples were revived and they were given

206
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,280
 new purposes in life.

207
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:35,040
 They were summoned to bear witness for the resurrection.

208
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,820
 By the way, the Greek word to bear testimony

209
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,440
 is the same as to be martyrs.

210
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,220
 Well, we can at least imagine the seriousness

211
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,220
 of the mandate to bear testimony, witness for Christ.

212
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,960
 Well, lest we get too nervous about sharing,

213
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,120
 let's remember the Holy Spirit is always there.

214
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,960
 He dwells in us to help us make sense of our testimony.

215
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,040
 Around the world, that testimony is shared

216
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,980
 one message at a time.

217
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,440
 It can be shared by a missionary or by a preacher.

218
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,400
 But it can also be by a housewife with his neighbor,

219
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,180
 by a business person with his colleague.

220
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
 And for the 11 o'clock service with a lot of families,

221
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,880
 it can be by a father or a mother

222
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,800
 with his precious son or daughter.

223
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,640
 Or even by a child with his beloved parent or grandparent.

224
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,260
 Testifying can come in moments of joy or despair,

225
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,940
 or even at death's door.

226
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,500
 I was probably like any one of you,

227
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,560
 considering that sharing the gospel is just an option

228
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,440
 and not something to be pursued for fear of rejection.

229
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,360
 Many years back while I was practicing in Singapore,

230
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,360
 in the line of work I came across this young man

231
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,060
 with very aggressive cancer.

232
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,080
 As his disease progressed, I actually contemplated

233
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,740
 to share the gospel with him.

234
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,000
 That opportunity never came.

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,760
 He left into a coma.

236
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,380
 By then nothing very much could be offered medically.

237
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,780
 But I did offer to the devastated wife,

238
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,220
 well, that maybe I could connect her to a pastor

239
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,980
 from the church to pray for her husband

240
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,420
 and maybe for the family.

241
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,980
 It was a Sunday.

242
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,700
 Everyone else had their own commitments.

243
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,260
 And to my disbelief, my pastor challenged me

244
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,320
 to be the one to share the gospel with her

245
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,720
 and to pray for the man.

246
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,780
 I felt so inadequate, so unprepared,

247
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:01,100
 so lacking in faith, and so clumsy in my mentoring.

248
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,220
 By asking my wife to come along,

249
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,720
 we did share the gospel and prayed with her.

250
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,300
 And we led her to Christ.

251
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,160
 This encounter had a tremendous impact

252
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,180
 on how I view myself as that person chosen

253
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,680
 at the right time to be empowered by the Holy Spirit,

254
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,760
 like any one of you, to be the right person

255
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,840
 at the right time, at the right place,

256
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,440
 to share a testimony.

257
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,920
 Once that commitment was made, doors just opened.

258
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,280
 I had this encounter with a lady

259
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,800
 who scolded me so badly about my care

260
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,400
 for his father's cancer.

261
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,020
 We only find out that subsequently

262
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,480
 we were from the same church.

263
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,740
 Well, it happens for a big church

264
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,180
 with more than 3,000 members.

265
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,820
 And I could understand that she was really stressed

266
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,960
 by his diagnosis.

267
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,660
 Anyway, along the way, we actually worked together

268
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,780
 and led his father to Christ.

269
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,300
 And even community groups can come together

270
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,400
 to be a blessing.

271
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,660
 A lady was stuck in the hospital for months.

272
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,180
 My group, my home group came around

273
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,520
 and visited her in the hospital,

274
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,440
 reached out for her family with four young kids,

275
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,960
 and even brought her out to Ritz-Carlton

276
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,240
 to celebrate her birthday.

277
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,900
 She used to be a Buddhist,

278
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,900
 but she found tremendous joy in knowing Christ

279
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,140
 before she departed.

280
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,780
 We should just seize the opportunities

281
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,780
 once we are prompted by the Holy Spirit.

282
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,880
 And I'm thankful to be brought up in a church culture

283
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,820
 where testifying, sharing the gospel

284
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,680
 anywhere, anytime, to anyone, is just natural.

285
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,560
 We just embrace that simple commitment

286
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,640
 to share the gospel and bring one person to Christ

287
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,540
 every year.

288
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,540
 There was also a rich Pentecostal heritage.

289
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,780
 We just believe in the power of the Holy Spirit.

290
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,220
 Where doors are seemingly closed, it can be opened.

291
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,600
 We can take down spiritual strongholds.

292
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,420
 We can speak prophetically when we hear from God,

293
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,040
 and we can bring hope where there seems to be no hope.

294
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,940
 An invitation is all that really matters.

295
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,620
 It is not so much because death is looming.

296
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,380
 Rather, it is an invitation to new life.

297
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,060
 My late parents came to know the Lord

298
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,620
 when they're in their late 70s.

299
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,080
 Someone visited them week after week,

300
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,460
 drive them to church while they were stuck in Toronto

301
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,220
 with no means of transportation and no social life.

302
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,940
 My wife came to know the Lord

303
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,760
 as some stranger housewife befriended her

304
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,100
 in the swimming pool where all the moms

305
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,160
 took the kids to learn to swim.

306
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,360
 She experienced the work of the Holy Spirit

307
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,260
 the very first time she stepped into the church.

308
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,560
 She was just stirred to weep,

309
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,620
 even though she never cried in adulthood.

310
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:22,300
 Indeed, the church is not a members club for believers,

311
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,300
 but a place whereby seekers should be welcomed and embraced.

312
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,420
 Could this church do that?

313
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,900
 I am eternally grateful for the different ones

314
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,900
 who invited me and my family to know the Lord.

315
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,800
 I want to be the one who invites someone

316
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,480
 to receive that eternal blessing.

317
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,780
 So my encouragement, be upfront in sharing your faith.

318
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,760
 Don't be an undercover agent.

319
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,220
 Be ready.

320
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,260
 You should not be surprised when your colleague

321
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,920
 come forth to ask for your counsel and your prayers.

322
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,700
 Be intentional to build relationship.

323
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,400
 Be authentic in caring.

324
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,360
 Invite a friend to Chinese offer,

325
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,840
 even though you may not be a Chinese speaker.

326
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,420
 We do our best, God will do the rest.

327
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,400
 Embrace your work.

328
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,780
 That is the most powerful testimony in the workplace.

329
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:34,840
 So far I've shared about rootedness in this word,

330
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,800
 as in the head.

331
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,600
 Reaching out to testify as in the hand.

332
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,100
 I wonder whether you notice that between the knowing

333
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,460
 and the doing, there's still something missing.

334
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,000
 The heart matter.

335
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,800
 And probably for many of us,

336
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,500
 the most difficult is the transformation of the heart.

337
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,280
 The Emmaus encounter reminded us

338
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,260
 that Jesus spent time with the disciples

339
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,060
 who were so disappointed, disillusioned.

340
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,940
 And yet, we witness that there's a major reversal

341
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,940
 of emotion, transforming despair into hope and action.

342
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,920
 All is not lost.

343
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,320
 The resurrected Jesus is in the midst of us right now,

344
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,020
 even when we are not aware.

345
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,260
 All it takes is our willingness

346
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,760
 to have our hearts transformed.

347
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,460
 The journey of the heart,

348
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,260
 despite the short distance from the head,

349
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,580
 is just not easy for many of us.

350
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,940
 My wife is heavily involved in prayer ministry

351
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,900
 and inner healing.

352
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,220
 She often asks me, "How do you feel?"

353
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,660
 I would rather she ask, "What do you think?

354
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,780
 "What shall we do?"

355
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,380
 Well, of course I knew some of the dark side

356
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,620
 from my own childhood.

357
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,940
 It was very difficult economically in the '60s.

358
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:10,100
 My wife conceived, my mom, I always say my wife, sorry.

359
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,740
 [audience laughing]

360
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,460
 My mom.

361
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,060
 I loved my wife as much as I loved my mom.

362
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,700
 [audience laughing]

363
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,240
 Anyway, in the '60s, so you can guess my age.

364
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,900
 My '60s, in the '60s, my mom conceived me

365
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,060
 and she was then at the age of 40.

366
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:38,320
 And somehow, as she anticipated a lot of hardship ahead,

367
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,660
 she actually tried, and she tried very hard to abort me.

368
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:48,680
 Well, by God's grace, I do not have too many physical

369
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,220
 or mental defects, as far as I know.

370
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,900
 Yeah, but surely there were a lot of racial defects

371
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,620
 from those emotional trauma while still inside the womb.

372
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,340
 She was in great distress, and to some extent,

373
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,820
 she passed on a lot of those fears

374
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,600
 and pessimistic outlook into my own life.

375
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,140
 She went through her own transformation

376
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,260
 as she subsequently managed to share this opening

377
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,240
 with myself.

378
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,220
 But in turn, I need my own renewal of heart

379
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,100
 to change my generally negative outlook in life.

380
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,560
 In my own practice, I used to spend a lot of time

381
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,280
 on organ transplantation.

382
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,140
 It is often and never taken, it is not often,

383
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,140
 and really, we should never take it for granted

384
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,400
 that organs becomes available.

385
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,140
 Someone needs to be willing to give.

386
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,900
 And the dilemma for heart transplant is even more intense.

387
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,300
 Someone needs to die to make a heart available

388
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,500
 for a person in need.

389
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,460
 But Jesus has already died that death,

390
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,300
 and he's ready to give that new heart to us.

391
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:14,300
 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you.

392
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,540
 I will remove from you your heart of stone

393
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,820
 and give you a heart of flesh.

394
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,700
 It would then be up to us to receive that gift

395
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,060
 from our donor, Jesus.

396
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:33,180
 If there's a moment that I literally cried from my heart,

397
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,180
 that was five years ago, when I wept, I cried,

398
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,460
 or even yelled, so much so that my wife,

399
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,380
 who was sound asleep at three o'clock in the morning

400
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,220
 in the upper room, heard my cry and rushed to comfort me.

401
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,220
 I was in great despair when I read through

402
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,220
 the medical literature to find out that

403
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,100
 the predicted median survival,

404
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:10,180
 the years to live for my type of leukemia

405
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,740
 would be eight years.

406
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,860
 I did not go down a literal road to Emmaus,

407
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,280
 but I was distraught.

408
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,640
 My wife came around to keep me company.

409
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,360
 Then somehow and knowingly, Jesus,

410
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,840
 a stranger to me, since I hardly recognized him,

411
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,320
 Jesus also came along.

412
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,800
 He helped me to know how foolish I was

413
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,640
 and how slow of heart to believe

414
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,760
 in all that he has spoken.

415
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,640
 But most significantly, he embraced us.

416
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,640
 The three of us had a time of fellowship

417
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,600
 with prayers and commitments.

418
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,760
 My heart was transformed.

419
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,500
 Late completion of a heart transplant surgery,

420
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,960
 it was pumping again.

421
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,680
 So allow your heart to cry.

422
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,360
 Cry out to Jesus.

423
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,680
 Cry out to your loved ones.

424
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,820
 And my desire for this church community

425
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,640
 is such that we find trusted fellow brothers and sisters

426
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,600
 whom we can cry out to to journey together

427
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,000
 and to receive healing together.

428
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,280
 The disciples who were once so discouraged

429
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,440
 now become a community of believers

430
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,640
 with transformed hearts,

431
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,640
 coming together to testify his goodness

432
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,240
 while welcoming others.

433
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,240
 In fact, every day they continue to meet together

434
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,000
 in the temple court.

435
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,600
 They broke bread in their homes

436
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,680
 and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,

437
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,480
 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people.

438
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,480
 And the Lord added to their number daily

439
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,760
 those who were being saved.

440
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,220
 So my encouragement is be committed to a community.

441
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,720
 Invite your pre-believer friends to your community

442
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,780
 to share the goodness of Christ.

443
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,760
 And for yourself, be open to inner healing

444
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
 and prayer ministry.

445
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,200
 Begin your own journey of the heart today.

446
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,600
 As we draw this sharing to a close,

447
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,840
 hear the cry of my heart for this congregation.

448
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,160
 Let us be committed to be rooted in his word.

449
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,680
 Be passionate in testifying

450
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,800
 and to continue our journey of the heart.

451
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,760
 I do want to have a chance for all of us

452
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,800
 to respond to this message.

453
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,040
 Can I invite the band

454
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,760
 and I also invite all of you to stand with us.

455
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,840
 (audience murmuring)

456
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,920
 There will be some of you

457
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,600
 who want to renew your commitment

458
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,680
 to know him through diligent studies

459
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,760
 so that you can trust him more.

460
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,240
 Come, make that commitment today.

461
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,840
 You will hear him speaking to you through his word.

462
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,920
 Some of you are stirred.

463
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,360
 You want to be that good friend

464
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,760
 who invites his friend to come to know Jesus.

465
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,800
 Be bold to ask today for the privilege

466
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,000
 to be that right person at the right place

467
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,240
 at the right time for that person you love.

468
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,180
 And some of you are crying from your heart.

469
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,600
 You yearn for a renewal,

470
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,280
 but you don't know where to start.

471
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,200
 Come, have fellowship with Christ.

472
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,360
 The altar is open.

473
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,120
 Our prayer team wants to partner with you,

474
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,920
 to pray alongside with you,

475
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,960
 to voice out, to shout out to the Lord

476
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,480
 your commitments to be rooted,

477
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,720
 to reach out and to renew.

478
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,120
 So this is a time for you to come forth,

479
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,440
 to open your hearts

480
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,800
 and to stop false,

481
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,440
 to be prayerful in a community of believers.

482
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,600
 Even in the upper house,

483
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,480
 our pastoral staff is ready to pray

484
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,480
 with whoever wants to have someone to pray alongside.

485
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,600
 Come.

486
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:27,120
 And for some of you who already made that commitment,

487
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,640
 I want also that you can invite

488
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,760
 someone standing next to you

489
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,080
 as long as you are comfortable.

490
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,900
 You may not even know that person,

491
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,480
 but yes, you invite him to pray with you

492
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,640
 so that you would be the one

493
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,440
 who invites someone to Jesus.

494
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,880
 You can also invite yourself

495
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,080
 to come and meet up with Jesus.

496
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,080
 So spend that time as the one standing next to you.

497
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,920
 Commit in prayers that you will indeed,

498
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:14,240
 you will indeed invite someone to Jesus

499
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,760
 and that someone can also be yourself.

500
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,080
 Okay, shall we go for a time of prayer,

501
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,760
 mutual ministry, pray with each other

502
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,920
 and we spend good time praying with

503
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,320
 and praying for each other.

504
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,900
 (gentle music)

505
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,480
 (gentle music)

506
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,060
 (gentle music)

507
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,480
 (gentle music)

508
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,060
 (gentle music)
