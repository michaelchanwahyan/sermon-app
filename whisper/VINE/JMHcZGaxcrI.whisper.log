[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Jesus, we thank you for Tim, Lord.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.300]   We thank you that you are speaking to him
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.600]   and you are also speaking through him, Jesus.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.380]   Lord, we thank you for the scripture
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.700]   that you have breathed into words, Lord,
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.600]   that's words that Tim can just take upon himself
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.520]   and that you are strengthening him to speak
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.580]   those same words out towards us, Jesus.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.920]   So Lord, we pray that your words may just
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.440]   fill his mouth today and so that they may
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440]   fill our spirits, Jesus.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.440]   Lord, I pray that just whatever he has prepared today, Lord,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.920]   they will just ring true in our hearts, Jesus.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.400]   That it is by your grace and by your name
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.400]   that these things can come true into our lives, Jesus, Lord.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.080]   So we thank you for Tim, we bless him out of this message.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.640]   Praise in your name, Jesus.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.720]   Amen. - Amen, amen.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.200]   Thank you, Benedict.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.760]   Hey, today is Benedict's first time service leading,
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.200]   so let's give him a big hand.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.680]   Well done, thank you so much.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.600]   My first year in university,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.560]   I was really struggling academically.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.120]   I had just spent one year in the US
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.160]   and my English was not that good.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.720]   And the requirements between high school
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.360]   and university quite differently.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.000]   So there really was this, I was stretched
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.520]   to the limits of my ability.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.800]   And there was this one moment that I remember,
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.960]   it's an iconic moment for me.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.380]   I was in one of the study rooms by myself,
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.360]   reading my pre-med biology book,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.360]   and there was a page where I didn't know 50 words
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.960]   on one page.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.520]   And that was a time when you use a physical dictionary
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.120]   to look up words.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.680]   So I started looking up words,
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.240]   and I mean, it just takes forever.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.120]   You even have to find the right word,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.960]   it's different than it is today.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.000]   And I was so discouraged.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.920]   I was like, how in the world am I supposed to
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.460]   even graduate from university?
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.160]   How is this even supposed to work?
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.280]   Now, that was not the only area where I was discouraged.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.480]   The other one was, it seemed like every class
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.220]   had like multiple papers due.
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.400]   10 page papers, you know, write two of those.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.880]   And since English already was not that easy for me,
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.580]   now I suddenly had to process everything in English,
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.760]   write everything in English.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.000]   And I really needed help.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.600]   I needed help.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.920]   And there was a guy on my freshman,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.160]   back then we call it dorm,
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.680]   nowadays we call it residence hall,
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.760]   in my freshman dorm, his name was Ryan.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.560]   And he was so gracious to me.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.480]   Like, he helped me read through my papers,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.000]   he gave me feedback on how I can improve them,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.280]   he helped even edit things,
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.960]   and it really made a huge difference for me.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.800]   'Cause I really was at the limits
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.640]   of what I was able to do at the time.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.200]   Now fast forward, probably like 10 years
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.080]   or something like that, I was a pastor,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.160]   I'm actually serving already at this time in Hong Kong
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.260]   at a different church.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.160]   And I just had this moment where I just realized
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.160]   this grace and mercy that God just has poured over my life.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.120]   Where he's placed people in my life
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.560]   that helped me along the way,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.320]   in significant ways, like my friend Ryan,
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   but also in other ways, and have just supported me,
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.600]   and allowed me to flourish,
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.360]   and even be at the point where I was at that time.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.640]   And I was just overcome with gratitude,
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.960]   with just God's goodness.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.640]   Wow, God, you're so good to me.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.400]   You have shown me so much love,
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.800]   so much care, so much kindness through all these people.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.360]   And I don't know if you ever have that experience
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.680]   where you're just so moved and touched by God,
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.180]   just for his goodness in your life.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.960]   And as I was sort of just sitting in that moment,
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.820]   suddenly there was the Holy Spirit's nudging.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.920]   Tim, it's time.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.680]   It's time for you to turn around and help others.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.540]   I've given you so much help,
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.340]   and now it's time for you to go and help those around you.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.640]   Now, it wasn't that I wasn't doing anything.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.840]   I mean, I was a pastor, I was involved in things.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.740]   There was certain ways where I was helping people in need.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.280]   But there was a gap between what I believed
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.680]   and what I actually did,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.520]   between my faith and between my actions.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.560]   And the Holy Spirit was nudging me,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.780]   let's close that gap.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.360]   Let's live more consistently with what you believe
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.980]   and what you're doing.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.020]   And so I believe for everyone,
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.860]   every Christian, every Jesus follower,
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.900]   there is this tension.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.320]   There's things we know about Jesus,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.580]   we know about loving our neighbor,
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.540]   we know about God's mercy, we know about justice,
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.940]   but then there's the part of actually doing it.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.780]   And so we're all on this journey of closing this gap,
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.980]   and we're at different points, and that's okay.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.020]   You know, some of us, maybe we haven't thought much
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.500]   about it, others of us, maybe you've already narrowed
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.900]   that gap in incredible ways,
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.900]   and that's beautiful and wonderful.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.200]   But what I wanna do today with you in this message,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.500]   I wanna explore with you this question.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.700]   How can I start narrowing the gap between what I believe
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.460]   about justice and mercy,
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.040]   and putting my faith more consistently into action?
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.000]   You know, how do I do this?
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.380]   And how can we take next steps on the journey?
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.980]   And so today we're continuing our God of Justice
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.940]   sermon series, we're in the fourth week.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.700]   At the beginning of the sermon series,
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.780]   we looked at the redemptive grand narrative of Scripture.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.420]   And I wanna take you to an image that I showed back then.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.860]   You're welcome also to go back online and watch the sermon.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.780]   So can we go to the image, please?
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.620]   Thank you.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.900]   So we, I'll start over here.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.700]   So we talked about that God created us for good.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.100]   And there's this overarching story in the Bible
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.860]   that makes sense out of all the books,
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.700]   all the different individual authors,
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.020]   and it's one large story, and it's that redemptive story.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.220]   And God created us for good.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.020]   And there's four relational contexts
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.300]   that he created to flourish.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.980]   You know, our relationship with God,
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.500]   our relationship with ourselves,
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.420]   our relationship with others, and our relationship
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.660]   with God, and our relationship with God.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.060]   And our relationship with creation.
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.180]   And as God created us, all of that was flourishing
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.700]   and thriving, and it was good.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.260]   It was really good.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.660]   But then something happened, right?
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.340]   We talked about Adam and Eve and how sin broke
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.380]   into the world, and that we were damaged by evil.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.940]   You know, that sin corrupted everything
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.260]   and impacted every aspect of our lives,
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.940]   and that's symbolized by these like lightning rods
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.940]   or squiggly lines.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.220]   And you see there's like breakdown in our relationship
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.340]   between us and God.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.340]   There's breakdown in our relationship even with ourselves.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.180]   There's breakdown in our relationship with others,
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.940]   and there's breakdown in our relationship with creation
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.740]   and how we steward and relate to creation.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.220]   Then we looked at Israel and God's story
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.420]   that he did not give up.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.380]   He did not give up on his creation.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.820]   He did not give up on his people.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.740]   And there's just this very long story of God not giving up,
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.820]   of God calling Abraham, setting apart Israel,
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.860]   calling them to be righteous and holy and just,
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.540]   and they go through these cycles of like being righteous,
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.820]   holy, and just, and then suddenly being unjust,
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.980]   and God confronts them.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.780]   But whatever was going on, that that cycle just continued.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.580]   Then we talked about that Jesus came,
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.260]   that he restored us for life,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.940]   that he entered into this broken world.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.180]   That's why the cross goes on the inside of this world.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.180]   He came into this world to break the power of sin,
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.820]   to make the unrighteous righteous in him
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.140]   through his forgiveness and give us new life.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.820]   But we also said that we don't just wanna remain
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.420]   that our relationship with God is restored,
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.060]   but that God actually has a mission for us
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.980]   and that he has sent us together to heal.
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.900]   You know, we're sent out now to go and do his,
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.740]   be participate in his redeeming, his healing,
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.540]   his renewing work in these four areas
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.300]   where God uses us to bring wholeness,
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.260]   to have his will done, to connect people with God,
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.780]   to restore relationships, to restore relationships
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.500]   between people with themselves, with others,
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.980]   and even with creation.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.300]   And so that's what we've been looking at.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.580]   And so what we're focusing on today is this part
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.300]   about our relationship between us and others
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:07.580]   and how God is calling us to bring,
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.340]   be part of his renewing and restoring work
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.860]   that has to do with addressing physical, emotional,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.140]   spiritual, relational needs,
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.260]   and just being available to God to make them thrive.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.380]   And so we wanna look on that interpersonal level.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.500]   And so we're today in the book of James.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.660]   Now, the book of James,
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.740]   James was Jesus's half brother.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.180]   He was a key leader in the early church.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.980]   He was a key leader in the church in Jerusalem.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.060]   And he wrote a letter to the Christians spread out
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.420]   across the Mediterranean area.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:51.420]   And the letter focused on living a life of authentic faith.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.020]   He wanted Jesus's followers to live lives of authentic faith.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.940]   And so in the first chapter,
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.860]   he talks about that we should not just be hearers
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.180]   of God's word, but we should be doers.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.380]   So we're meant to hear God's word,
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.620]   but we're also meant to put it into action.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.380]   And so we really emphasize that.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.060]   And then a lot of this authentic faith that he talks about,
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.060]   it was about how we relate, especially to those in need.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.260]   You know, how we express it,
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.820]   that we don't discriminate,
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.460]   that we care for the widows, the orphans,
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.260]   those who are living in crisis.
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:40.660]   And that when we do that, you know, we bring honor to God.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.100]   We live out of that image of God that he has given us.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.260]   And we live out of that, that righteousness,
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.140]   that holiness, that love to those around us.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.820]   And so that's where we're gonna pick up the story in James,
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.340]   or in James chapter two.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.300]   And it says this, verse 14.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.580]   What good is it, my brothers and sisters,
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.380]   if someone claims they have faith, but has no deeds?
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.180]   Can such faith save them?
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:12.980]   Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.180]   If one of you says to him, go in peace,
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.860]   keep warm and well fed,
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.380]   but does nothing about their physical needs.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.380]   What good is it?
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.780]   In the same way, faith by itself,
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.140]   if it is not accompanied by actions, is dead.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:37.700]   So James here, part of the scenario
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.700]   is he's addressing Christians who somebody has argued
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.620]   that you can separate faith and works,
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.260]   that you can just have faith.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.020]   You can just have this mental ascent.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.940]   You know, I believe in Jesus.
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.460]   I have a relationship with him and that's it.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.180]   Nothing else is needed.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:01.180]   And James is saying, uh-uh, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.020]   That's not how it works.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.260]   Faith and actions always belong together.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.860]   You cannot separate them.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.380]   And so he raises that question.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.020]   He says, how can someone claim to have faith,
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.980]   but have no deeds?
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.940]   Because we see faith when there's deeds, right?
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.620]   We see that then expressed.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.660]   And what is the usefulness of that kind of faith?
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.900]   If you say you have faith, but it never expresses itself
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.700]   in any practical way or form towards other people.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.660]   And he even raises the question,
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.900]   does that person have an authentic, a saving faith?
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.700]   If you claim to have faith, but there is no actions
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.500]   of loving and caring for people around us.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.100]   Because if the spirit of God is living in you,
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.020]   surely he will move you, mobilize you to start loving
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.860]   and caring for the people around you.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.860]   Then he asks us to imagine the scenario.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.900]   So I wanna dive a little bit in with you on that.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.780]   He says in verse 15, suppose a brother or a sister
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.780]   is without clothes and daily food.
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.020]   Everyone picturing that?
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.580]   If one of you says to them, go in peace
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.980]   and keep warm and well fed, but does nothing
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.020]   about their physical need, what good is it?
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:24.300]   Now, it'll be easy to rush past this part.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.660]   I used to rush past this part when I read James.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.860]   But just think of this, the person is described as naked.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.660]   That means they have no clothes.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.380]   They lack one of the most basic necessities
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.620]   to protect themselves from cold weather,
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.420]   warm weather, rainy weather, from parasites,
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.820]   from other dangers.
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.580]   I mean, they're extremely vulnerable.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.380]   And then they're also described
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.380]   that they're lacking daily food.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.940]   So that means they're not just like one time
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.700]   not having enough to eat for one meal.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.340]   It's like a regular thing.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.580]   They're just, they don't have what it takes to live,
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.020]   to have the nutrients to flourish and thrive.
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.340]   And then we're supposed to imagine
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.940]   that somebody says to them,
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.940]   like, go in peace, keep warm and well fed,
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.340]   and then just walks away.
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.260]   Isn't that ridiculous?
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.180]   Doesn't that make you upset?
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.860]   I feel like there's no reaction.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.940]   Yes?
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.380]   Right, it's stupid, right?
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.220]   Come on.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.180]   And so that's exactly James' point.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.420]   He's like, it is ridiculous that somebody
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.940]   has such desperate needs to ignore them
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.820]   and to just blabber spiritually.
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:43.340]   You know, just to say these spiritual words and phrases,
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:47.700]   but do nothing about the personal need.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.980]   And so James is saying,
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.300]   faith and actions, they belong together.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.900]   We cannot separate them.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.260]   And so in verse 70, he says this,
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.820]   "In the same way, faith by itself,
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.820]   "if it is not accompanied by action,
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.500]   "is that authentic faith is always expressed in actions."
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.380]   It always is.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.540]   Authentic faith is always expressed in actions.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:21.060]   So this reminds me of social media,
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.060]   hashtag thoughts and prayers.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.900]   Anyone?
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.540]   Anyone else?
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.940]   Okay, let me explain.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.260]   So, you know, one of the things,
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.980]   whenever there's a world crisis,
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.740]   let's say there is a, we just had,
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.260]   I don't know, was it Helen, Helene,
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.380]   the natural disaster in the US,
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.260]   or war, or school shooting,
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.740]   or whatever else it may be, right?
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.820]   And then people, they send their thoughts and prayers
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.100]   on social media, hashtag thoughts and prayers.
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.020]   And recently, there's been, like the last several years,
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.700]   there's been a lot of pushback on that.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.260]   Like, hey, you say thoughts and prayers,
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.540]   but you never do anything about what's happening.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.420]   Especially like, if it's a politician,
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.700]   you know, he says thoughts and prayers,
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.380]   but they actually have power to do something about policies.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.380]   So people have been getting really fed up
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.340]   with sending thoughts and prayers.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.060]   And from, if you look at James's example,
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.100]   we can understand why,
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.900]   because if people say spiritual stuff,
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.420]   but there's never any action,
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.100]   people are asking, what good is it?
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.780]   If you see, go in peace, stay, you know,
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.300]   well fed and warm.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.980]   But I've seen also that,
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.780]   so I wanna talk about it a little bit.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.020]   Let me go back on that.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:41.820]   Now thoughts and prayers in some circumstances,
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.380]   I think it's an okay response, right?
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.900]   Like something's geographically far removed.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.300]   We're not right there.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.260]   We think about the people, we pray for them.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.300]   We trust that God works through prayers.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.940]   You know, that is not a bad thing necessarily.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.540]   Or there might be very complex issues
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.060]   where there is no easy, simple, straightforward response.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.420]   In James, the response is clear.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.780]   There's a person that's naked
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.820]   and a person that's malnourished.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.500]   So you know what to do.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.980]   But sometimes we don't always right away know what to do.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.500]   Maybe it takes some time to figure out what to do.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.900]   And so thoughts and prayers
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.140]   and in those circumstances can be okay.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.940]   And the reason why I say this is,
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.660]   as a pastor, I've seen that people have picked up
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.220]   on this criticism of thoughts and prayers.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.900]   And I think we should take this serious
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.500]   because we should not just be people
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.020]   who say thoughts and prayers and that's it.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.700]   But at the same time, what I've seen even Christians do,
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.300]   throw out the faith part and just focus on actions.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.980]   And they're actually meant both to stay together.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.620]   You know, that we do pray, but that we also do act.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.020]   And so one thing that I wanna say is that
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.540]   we should never use the complexities of an issue
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.500]   where maybe it takes us a while to respond
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.020]   as an excuse for never doing anything.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:08.020]   And I think we have a tendency to do that as a church.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.460]   And so putting all of this in context
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.620]   and our God of just sermons here
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.340]   is I wrote this statement, it says this.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.020]   Jesus did not restore us for life
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:22.940]   so that we only offer thoughts and prayers to people.
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.580]   But he has restored us for life
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.140]   so that we contribute practically to the physical,
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.980]   relational, emotional, and spiritual needs of people.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.700]   That we do both, that we pray and that we act.
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.860]   Can I get an amen?
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.460]   - Amen. - Thank you.
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.020]   All right, just making sure we're engaged here.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.020]   Now in 2007, my father, he passed away of cancer.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.060]   And something that I just found out not too long ago,
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.300]   I think last year about him,
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:01.300]   was that he supported a mom, a single mom with a daughter
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.820]   together with one or two friends for 18 years.
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.580]   Gave substantially financially to this family
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.000]   to make sure the daughters cared for the schooling,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.540]   the clothing, and all these things.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.020]   He never talked about it.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.060]   And I found this out about my father.
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.540]   And I was like, wow, that's so beautiful thing
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.780]   to learn about your dad that you didn't even know it.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.020]   You know, he never said anything.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:32.020]   And for me, that was the way that he was able to help.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.380]   He worked a lot, he had finances,
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.580]   so he could help financially someone.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.060]   But there's different ways that we can help and love
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.420]   and bring up people who are in need of help
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.300]   and support around us.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.820]   And by the way, everybody here
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.900]   has something they can contribute,
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.860]   has a gift, a talent, has time that you can use
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.560]   to bring up people around you who are in need.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.460]   So whether that is your practical skills,
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.360]   maybe you're good at fixing something,
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.820]   or maybe you help somebody fix their washer.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.040]   If that's good with sewing,
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.020]   well, maybe you help somebody sew things
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.020]   so they don't have to buy those things.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.280]   If you're good at listening,
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.900]   maybe just spend time with people
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.280]   and just listen to them and care for them.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.060]   If that's inviting people into your family
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.260]   to be part of your family,
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.740]   that's also a way of just loving and bringing up people,
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.900]   because not everybody has a normal family experience.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.680]   As I was praying for the service,
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.700]   I really had the sense that actually this was a word
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.220]   or encouragement for somebody.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.300]   That it was somebody who was thinking about
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.180]   hosting and just welcoming people in their family,
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.720]   and I felt like I should encourage that.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.320]   So here's an encouragement for whoever this may be.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.640]   Now, the important thing is that we do put our faith
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.660]   in action, and that our faith does not just consist
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.680]   of words, of empty words, right?
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.720]   And that we can reflect this character, this image,
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.360]   being image bearers of God,
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.120]   that we can reflect it in our relationships with others,
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.840]   and just bring them up, share the love of Jesus,
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.080]   share the concern of Jesus, be kind,
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.080]   lift people up around us who are struggling
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.960]   so that they can thrive, that they can flourish.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.040]   So I have this statement that I think sums up
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.080]   what James is saying here.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.560]   It says this, "Real faith is seen through our actions
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.080]   "when we lift up those in need."
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.360]   No, real faith is seen through our actions
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.600]   when we lift up those in need.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.640]   So I think this raises for all of us the question,
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.080]   do we have real faith?
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.320]   Are we lifting up people around us who are in need?
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.520]   And if we're not, I think we need to start praying
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.920]   and thinking about this.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.320]   And it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor,
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.440]   if you're a man or a woman,
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.400]   if you feel like you have lots of talents,
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.040]   little talents, everyone has something to offer,
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.200]   something can contribute.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.840]   If you make yourself available to God,
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.520]   everybody has something to offer to bring others up.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.560]   Every single person.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.600]   Now, I'm excited.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.160]   I've invited two people, Debra and Pradeep,
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.840]   to share with us about their journey
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.080]   of putting their faith into action.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.920]   And so let's, as they come up here,
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.000]   let's welcome them, I'm excited.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.120]   Thank you.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.280]   (audience applauding)
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:45.600]   I have my cue cards here.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.840]   I'm prepared.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.400]   All right.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   So to begin with, can Debra also have a microphone?
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.200]   Thank you.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.800]   So to begin with, I would just love to hear,
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.840]   not everybody here knows you,
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.520]   I would just love to hear maybe a little bit about you,
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.960]   who you are, how long you've been in Hong Kong,
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.840]   what you're doing here,
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.160]   and maybe perhaps we can actually start with Debra
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.120]   and then have Pradeep share after that.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.320]   I'm born and raised in Hong Kong,
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.160]   and I live in America for 10 years
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.840]   before I returned to Hong Kong as a missionary
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.080]   about 23 years ago.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.400]   I joined the Yuen Long last year in April.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.000]   How about you?
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.760]   Okay, my name is Pradeep and I'm from South India.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.480]   My wife Cynthia and I,
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.120]   we are living in Hong Kong for past two years,
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.080]   working as cross-cultural missionaries in Shanti,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.840]   an NGO, and then we are part of Y Nuen Long
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.360]   from the time the church was launched.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.000]   Wonderful.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.480]   I love both of them, they're amazing.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.600]   So I'm super excited about this time here.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.000]   So one thing that I was thinking about,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.760]   you know, how do you get started on this justice journey?
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.720]   How do you, like, was there something
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.160]   that like sparked you on this journey?
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.040]   And so we'd just love to hear about that.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.240]   Yeah, sure, I believe the journey started
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.880]   during the time when I was in America,
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.320]   about 30 years ago.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   I became foster parent to take care of children
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   who needs a home.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.200]   And at that time I was doing that
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.120]   because of money,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.520]   because I was a stay-at-home mom
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.280]   and taking care of my children,
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.800]   so I want to bring some income home.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.280]   And so I started this journey,
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.560]   but when I started this journey
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.920]   and God let me see something different
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.440]   when I'm doing the foster care.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.160]   And also the church in America
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.200]   always taught us to open our house,
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.160]   our home for other people in need.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.160]   And our church always have a big meeting
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.240]   and those attend the church.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.960]   And so there's people that will attend the meeting
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   and they came from different places in the country.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.920]   And so we will open our home to let them stay with us
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.240]   and also cook them meal while they're staying.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.920]   Cool, so that's your origin story of fostering
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.240]   and also welcoming people from, you know,
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.480]   these conferences in your home.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.160]   And yeah, how about you Pradeep?
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.880]   So growing up in India,
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.600]   somehow I developed this idea that Indians,
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.320]   that means we share gospel,
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.240]   we share Jesus through words.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.360]   And missionaries from West,
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.160]   they share Jesus through actions and serving people
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.040]   like building hospitals, building orphanages
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.880]   and schools kind of stuff,
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.000]   because I believe they have a lot of money
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.280]   and we don't have money.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.640]   So all that we can do is like,
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.360]   we just share gospel through our words.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.080]   But my perspective changed when my parents,
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.840]   my dad and my mom, they're pastors,
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.360]   when they started a home for the orphans
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.720]   and they gave shelter to eight boys for a long time.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.560]   So I see my mom,
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.800]   she cooked three meals every day for a long time
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.960]   and I never see her complaining or grumbling a single time.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.120]   And my dad, he provided for all of us,
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.200]   the eight boys and three of us, the same things.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.680]   So there was no partiality between us.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.120]   And I always see my parents,
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.960]   my mom was always joyful after working the whole day.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.920]   And my dad was so peaceful after providing for so many of us
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.400]   with the limited resources.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.480]   So that helped me to understand like,
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.080]   serving others does not need a surplus amount of resources.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.880]   All that it needs is a heart
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.680]   that's full of compassion and sacrifice.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.800]   Yeah, and we also started--
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.600]   (audience applauding)
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.160]   And as kids, three of us, me and my two siblings,
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.600]   we started sharing the things we have.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.000]   And I believe like that's how my journey
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.440]   of putting faith in action started.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.120]   - So it starts a lot of times,
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.320]   even with the little that we have
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.720]   and making it available to people
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.920]   and experiencing how God works through that.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.760]   Yeah, wonderful.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:12.000]   I'm curious, so we're talking about putting faith in action
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.640]   and James, there's an emphasis particularly
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.200]   on the marginalized and the vulnerable.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   And so I wonder, what does that look like for you now
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.480]   to put your faith and action
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.640]   towards the marginalized and vulnerable
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.600]   and those in distress?
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.440]   So maybe Deborah.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.720]   - Yes, when I returned to Hong Kong as a missionary,
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.240]   at one point by faith,
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.840]   God gave me a ministry to open my home
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.280]   to house some people that they are in need.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.360]   So I started to let people to stay with me.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.960]   Some drug addicts who want to get off drug,
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.480]   some came out from prison.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.360]   And there are some children who were in trouble.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.240]   And then also about 15 years ago,
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   I also let, I invited a mother who came from Mother's Choice
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.080]   with her newborn baby to stay with us.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.840]   So 15 years had gone and the girls grow up
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.280]   and became part of my family, yes.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.720]   - Wow, amazing.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.560]   (audience applauding)
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.160]   - And now at this stage of my life,
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.000]   I'm a volunteer in this church
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.600]   and also I'm a tutor, volunteer
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.840]   to teach non-Chinese children homework.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.440]   - Well, Deborah, yes.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.800]   (audience applauding)
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.040]   You know, you're so courageous.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.360]   And so yeah, what an inspiring example
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.560]   for just how you welcome people in your home.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.040]   How about you, Pradeep?
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.520]   - So I would say understanding
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.080]   that I need to put my faith in actions.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.560]   It changed the course of my life
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.800]   and I got clarity in finding my purpose
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.520]   and it opened doors for me to come Hong Kong
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.120]   and serve in Shanti where our main focus
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.800]   is working with ethnic minorities,
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.040]   especially the children and youth
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.680]   who I think they are more vulnerable in the society.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.040]   So Shanti has given me a few opportunities
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.640]   where I can serve them in different ways.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.360]   And the first thing is like we know their need,
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.880]   know what they need and then like try to help them
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.160]   in any way you can.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.720]   And first thing is like we empower them
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.600]   in education through tutorials
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.400]   so they understand Chinese and math better
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.640]   and they get confident in their academics
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.960]   and also in their life.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.840]   So we do not judge them when they come to us
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   so they feel they are accepted.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.720]   We listen to them so they feel they are valued
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.240]   and we pray for them so that they understand
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.680]   that Jesus loves them and God has a plan
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.960]   and purpose in their lives.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.480]   And the last thing is whatever we are able to provide,
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.080]   we will provide the basic needs
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.560]   so that they feel that God cares for them
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.400]   and God provides for them.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.240]   - Wonderful.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.080]   (audience applauds)
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:49.920]   Thank you.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:56.560]   Yeah, I'm, you know, even just like I shared earlier
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.200]   with the tutoring, right, like I can even relate to that
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.120]   because I really have myself received that type of help.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.360]   So it's amazing, makes such a difference.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:10.040]   I wonder this journey of like putting faith in action,
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.780]   it's not always easy.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.880]   There is challenges along the way
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.640]   and I just would love if you can share a little bit
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.240]   about some challenges or oppositions
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.740]   and how you dealt with them.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:24.800]   - Well, I have learned so many things in this journey
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.600]   which transformed my life.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.520]   Yes, I've been hurt many, many times
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.920]   and many, many tears too.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:37.880]   And due to a lot of frustration and discouragement,
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.280]   I sometimes would doubt about God.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.780]   And I pray for these people to change and get out of trouble
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.900]   but they didn't change.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.820]   And many times they lied to me, they stole from me
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.820]   and they die of overdose of drug and they commit suicide.
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:05.660]   And many didn't even say a word of thank you
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.940]   and just accusing me of not doing good enough.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.480]   And so, well, how to deal with it?
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.260]   I just always cry out to God.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:20.280]   And also I ask God to help and be merciful to me
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.400]   and to others.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.800]   - Wow, thank you for sharing that.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.980]   How about you, Pradeep?
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.560]   - So I would say the expectations.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.400]   So after pouring out all the love
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.760]   and pouring out all the service in their lives,
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.320]   sometimes you may not really see
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.480]   the expected result in their life.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.120]   So after working for a long time,
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.080]   maybe there is no visible change in their life
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.480]   or their situation.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.920]   And sometimes their life or character,
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.980]   their situation gets worse after a course of time.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.000]   So when we don't say anything, we feel discouraged
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.080]   that after pouring out everything,
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.840]   the result is not as we wanted.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.080]   So that's one thing, we get discouraged.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.160]   And the second thing is after giving and giving
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.060]   and serving and serving, sometimes we feel like we are empty.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:09.040]   So I would say that's the time where we have people
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.000]   who are godly people who surround us,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.080]   who stands with us to pray and support us in every way.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.240]   So when we have godly people with us, it really encourages.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.100]   So they feel us and then we get more strength and courage
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.680]   to go and serve people again.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.040]   - You know, following Jesus,
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.000]   Bible doesn't say that it's easy being a disciple.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And so there are tough parts when we live for his glory
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.320]   and just love and serve people unconditionally.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.600]   And so we wanted to keep this conversation authentic
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.560]   but also hear about how you deal with those challenges
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.380]   along the way.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.480]   So thanks both of you so much for sharing those.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.800]   It's okay, you can clap.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.520]   (audience applauding)
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.040]   There's so much love coming your way.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.440]   It's like you say a few words and everybody
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.540]   is just so supportive of you guys.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.340]   What encouragement actually do you have for everyone here
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.680]   about putting their faith and action and loving our neighbors
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.300]   and bringing people up?
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:16.000]   - Well, I believe all of us have the love and compassion
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   from God, but due to different reasons and hurt in our life,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.960]   we don't use them, we don't develop it
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.900]   and we don't function properly.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.880]   And God called different people to do different things
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:38.880]   in different situations and so we don't need to compare.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.060]   And we do whatever and whenever we can.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:48.060]   And if you don't know what, then I'm sure if you ask God,
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.680]   God will show you and tell you what.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.680]   And start from our home with small task is important.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:02.200]   And knowing that God is always so merciful to us
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.900]   and help us and we need to learn to offer unconditionally
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:15.080]   and being generous to others with a pure heart
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.520]   and that is important.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.260]   A lot of times we may have expectations.
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:28.560]   We want to, we expect something to happen,
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.440]   we expect a very good result.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.440]   But a lot of times expectations may lead to disappointment.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.100]   And so we have to understand that transformation
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.020]   of people's life, appreciation and reward
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.300]   have to come from our almighty God.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:54.600]   And so finally, let us not become wary in doing good.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:00.040]   For the proper time, we will reap a harvest
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.600]   if we do not give up.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   So no matter the task is great or small, known or unknown,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:16.280]   please don't give up and keep focusing on God
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.800]   and keep trying to use the God-given compassion
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.620]   to help our neighbors.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.880]   - Thank you Debra.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.280]   Yeah, how about you Pradeep?
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.440]   (audience applauding)
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.880]   - So I have, I feel like God has taught me a few things
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.000]   in this journey of missions
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.520]   and I just want to share a few of them with you.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.520]   And the first thing is, it's not about how much you have,
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.880]   it's all about what you have
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.800]   and how you use it in serving others.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.720]   The second thing is like,
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.340]   it's not about what your neighbor is worth of,
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.160]   it's all about like what we have received from Jesus.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.640]   The grace, the love that we have freely received,
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.280]   that we freely give to them.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.320]   And the next one is like, if we are available to God
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.600]   and if we are sensitive to our neighbors,
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.520]   God will show us the opportunities,
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.240]   how we can serve our neighbors through actions.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.160]   And the last thing is like,
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.280]   no matter if you are sowing seeds or if you are planting,
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.880]   but remember that God is the one who gives growth
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.160]   and your reward will be with the Lord
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.080]   when he comes back a second time.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.280]   - Amen.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.680]   Let's give them a big hand.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.800]   Thank you so much.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.280]   I'm just amazed.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.640]   I was so encouraged when I read,
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.360]   so I gave them a questions and they wrote out some things
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.520]   and just hearing right now what they're sharing
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.840]   and just their faithfulness in loving those around them
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.800]   and bring them up, it's amazing.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.000]   And I know I'm encouraged and inspired,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.680]   I hope you are as well and you found this helpful
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.160]   of what putting our faith and action can look like.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.080]   For me, one thing that was on my heart for today
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.200]   was like in a justice sermon series,
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.720]   it's really easy to talk so abstract,
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.760]   that we maybe never personally connect
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   to what we talk about.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.800]   But God wants to involve every one of us.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.680]   He has sent us out to heal
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.600]   and he wants to use you to bring up other people,
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.960]   to share God's love with other people,
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.120]   to allow them to flourish and thrive.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.760]   And as we heard, he's given every one of those things
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.280]   and we can be generous with whatever it is that we have,
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.960]   our time, our resources, our gifts, our talents.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.200]   And if we make ourselves available to God,
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.160]   then he will use us.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.800]   And so I opened up with a question,
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.720]   I wanna invite the worship team to come up by the way.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.840]   I opened up with a question,
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.840]   how can we narrow this gap between our faith
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.040]   and what we believe about justice and mercy
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.720]   and putting that into action?
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.600]   You know, what does that look like?
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.320]   And we're all at different points on this journey.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.800]   You know, every single one of us are at different points.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.040]   And that's okay.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:12.920]   But my sense for today was that just like
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.840]   as I was just moved by the mercy and the love
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.520]   and the kindness of God on that day,
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.160]   when I was thinking about how all these people
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.560]   that helped me in my life,
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.640]   that God just reveals his goodness, his love,
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.240]   his mercy to you.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:33.000]   And that as he does that, that he also nudges you,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.800]   that the Holy Spirit nudges you and says, it's time.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:41.400]   It's time to put your faith into action.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.920]   It's time to take that next step.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.880]   It's time to make yourself available to the King of Kings
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.960]   for the incredible work that he wants to do
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.520]   through your life.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.240]   Come on, people.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.680]   I'm excited about that.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:04.560]   And so what I wanna do is I wanna actually create a space
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.320]   for us to pray.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.600]   And I brought up some practical ways
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.400]   that we can think about people around us.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.720]   There's four, actually there's multiple questions.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.560]   Can we please bring those up, please?
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.960]   There is, how is my neighbor doing relationally?
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.760]   How's my neighbor doing physically?
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.840]   How's my neighbor doing mentally?
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.320]   How's my neighbor doing spiritually?
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.600]   And all of this, of course,
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.880]   assumes that we actually talk to people
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.680]   and that we get to know these things about their lives.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.320]   But as we pray, as Pradeep shared,
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.440]   as we just ask God and Deborah as well,
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.000]   he will show you how he can love
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.560]   and bring up people around you.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.000]   And you're gonna be able to do it
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.880]   'cause it's God speaking to you.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.160]   He has gifted you.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.560]   He has put his spirit inside of you.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.400]   And so I wanna just ask us right now just to pray
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.560]   and just ask the Holy Spirit,
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.360]   Holy Spirit, how do you want me to love
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.120]   and serve those around me?
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.640]   So let's do that for a minute and then I'll pray over us.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.680]   Let's pray right now.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.400]   (gentle music)
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.440]   (people chattering)
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.040]   (gentle music)
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.040]   (people chattering)
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.680]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.840]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:41:17.720]   I wanna invite everyone to stand.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.320]   (gentle music)
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:26.040]   You know, we don't love our neighbor
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.560]   out of our own strength.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.680]   We love because he first loved us.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.200]   And some of us, you know, we're tired, we're exhausted.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.160]   Right now we're like,
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.400]   this guy's just talking about me doing stuff.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.320]   But the Holy Spirit can fill us
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:46.360]   and can give us the strength and the grace to do his work.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.000]   We don't do it out of our own strength.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.240]   We do it by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.760]   So I wanna invite you,
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.640]   if you wanna be filled by the Spirit,
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.320]   just stretch out your hands.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.000]   Just say, Lord, I'm here.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.640]   I wanna be filled by your Spirit.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.160]   I wanna receive from you right now
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.240]   so that I can pour it into others.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.600]   So stretch out your hands before,
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.400]   you know, I just wanna pray over us.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.760]   Holy Spirit, will you fill your people?
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.880]   Will you pour your mercy, your grace, your strength,
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.600]   your love into the people's hearts?
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:27.040]   We love others not by our own strength,
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.880]   but because of your strength,
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.400]   because of you at work in us,
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.920]   because of your love, because of your power,
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:36.000]   because of your grace, because of your mercy.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.720]   So will you fill your people right now?
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.800]   Thank you, Holy Spirit.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:45.120]   Renew your people, strengthen your people.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.160]   Recharge your people now.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:56.440]   Release faith that you can use us.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:03.640]   Lead us into opportunities, divine appointments,
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.880]   where we're the ones who can help.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.000]   We're the ones who can pour out your love.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.680]   May you be honored and glorified.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.840]   I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.000]   Amen, amen.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.560]   Let's worship church.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
