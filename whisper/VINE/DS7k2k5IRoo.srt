1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
 We are so glad that you are here in this moment and a part of what we're doing.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,200
 And I'm really excited. We're doing something a little bit different today.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,600
 And we're going to have a conversation on this topic of spiritual friendships.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,880
 And, you know, this is something that's always been integral to our vision of growing big people here at The Vine.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,200
 We always say that actually our most amount of profound maturity and growth happens,

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,520
 not just in our own individual moments with God,

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,680
 but actually as we live out life with one another in that community.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,400
 Spiritual friendships are a part of that community.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,960
 It's where one or two people gather together and share life at a deeper level,

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,040
 pray for one another, love one another, walk with one another.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,360
 And that's what we get to do today. That's what we're going to talk about.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,760
 And we thought one of the great ways to do that would be to actually model to you

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,760
 a little bit of what those kind of relationships and friendships are like

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,480
 by doing an intimate conversation with myself and Sarah O.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,440
 And welcome, Sarah. It's great to have you with us.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,760
 It's great to be here. Thank you for having me.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,200
 You know, we're so blessed because Sarah has really over a number of years now

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,600
 with her family been embedded here at The Vine and just shared so much about our relationships

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,400
 and what life is like doing life together.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,600
 She's been very formative in our growing big people vision as well.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,840
 And I just want to thank you so much for the way that you haven't just sat in a pew on a Sunday,

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,880
 but you've really kind of really integrated your heart and your philosophy and spirituality into The Vine.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,800
 So, thank you. And what a pleasure to have you today.

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,320
 It's great. It's so much nicer than sitting in my living room.

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,440
 Yeah, and you're not in your pajamas either. You're looking very nice. That's great.

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,600
 So, we're talking about spiritual friendships and in particular,

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,080
 you know, how mentoring and spiritual friendships kind of works together.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,000
 And it might sound a little obvious, but, you know, relationships obviously sits in the center of that.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,320
 And I know that you've thought and reflected quite a bit on what relationship is.

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,920
 Tell me a little bit about how you see relationship being integral to a kind of spiritual relationship

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,560
 or spiritual kind of friendship environment.

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:07,360
 Right. You know, you'd think it'd be obvious, but actually, sometimes it's easy to overlook the obvious thing

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,960
 and get busy with many, many things.

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,040
 And that's what happened in Jesus' day.

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,440
 You know, the Jews were really busy doing a lot of things to worship.

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,080
 And when asked, Jesus summed up their entire law by saying,

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,000
 "It's really about loving God, loving others as yourself."

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,040
 And we at The Vine also, we have so many great ways to connect,

39
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,680
 but it's really worthwhile to pause and think about what's at the heart of those connections,

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,200
 which is relationship. And, you know, especially in this time of COVID, you know.

41
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,560
 Yeah, you know, this has been such an interesting thing for all of us, right?

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,280
 COVID, how that's been a challenge to some of our relationships,

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,920
 how that's actually kind of thrown things a little bit out of the normal mix.

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,280
 You and I were reflecting on this the other day.

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,920
 Tell me a little bit more about what COVID has done for you in terms of your relationships

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,240
 and how that might impact us either in positive or negative ways

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,280
 as it comes into kind of thinking about spiritual friendships in this time.

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,080
 Yeah, you know, before COVID, we could just, most of us could just turn up to places and events

49
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,080
 and have really nicely organized ways of connecting.

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,720
 You know, you could go to work, you could go to church, you could go out to dinner with friends

51
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,040
 and just have this automatic ways of connecting without doing a lot of work.

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,040
 Well, COVID took so much of that away.

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,760
 And so on the one hand, we lost our usual ways of connecting.

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,960
 And then on the other hand, we all found ourselves thrown into really spending time with a few people.

55
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,400
 And then all of a sudden we had to deal with relationships.

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,440
 And so, you know, one of the gifts of COVID is that it really leveled the playing field.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,960
 You know, we all experienced the same trauma.

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,440
 We all went into this survival mode.

59
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,560
 We all kind of felt like we lost control over our environment.

60
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,800
 And so it did give us ways to connect on a human level that we really hadn't had before.

61
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:18,040
 And so really, you know, though we had to deal with, and we still have to deal with relationships,

62
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,760
 the good, the bad, and the ugly, all of it.

63
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:31,400
 But now we have this tremendous opportunity to show up with one another in more vulnerable and deep ways.

64
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,840
 You know, showing up means being willing to be vulnerable and be present with people in their joys and sorrows.

65
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,520
 I think this is such an important thing you're saying,

66
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,000
 because I think vulnerability is being something that this whole COVID season has opened to us.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,200
 And not only that, but the social unrest season we were in before,

68
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,880
 you know, and one of the interesting things with that time was that social unrest was such a divisive time.

69
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,080
 It was like, which side are you on?

70
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,960
 And everybody was trying to work out like that kind of sort of,

71
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,360
 that sort of divided a lot of families and a lot of people in society politically at the time.

72
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,200
 But COVID has sort of had the opposite effect in a way, right?

73
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,880
 It's kind of drawn us together.

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,280
 It's kind of made us sort of say, look, we're all in this against this kind of disease, and how do we do that?

75
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,080
 But I think this idea of vulnerability is critical.

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,680
 You know, one of the things that I'm sure many of you at home are sensing and feeling in this time is,

77
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,520
 is that sense of vulnerability, maybe not being around family as much as perhaps you have been able to in the past,

78
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,280
 or there's been disruptions in family relationships during this time.

79
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:37,640
 And I think what sits at the heart of spiritual friendships is the idea of counterbalancing that disruption with love.

80
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:44,800
 And the thought of like, you know, these relationships are a place where we can express and experience and find love.

81
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 And I know that you've thought a lot about this in relation to Jesus,

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,640
 and the ways in which Jesus, both with His disciples and others,

83
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,960
 model this kind of spiritual friendship and love in the heart of that.

84
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,560
 Can you tell us a little bit more about what you see in Jesus and how Jesus models this for us in our relationships?

85
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,720
 Right, yeah.

86
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,240
 You know, Jesus spent three years with His disciples.

87
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,120
 They did everything together.

88
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,120
 And on the eve of His crucifixion near the end of His life, He wanted to have dinner with them one last time.

89
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:25,080
 And, you know, it's funny, all the ministry they did, all the traveling they did, and the teaching,

90
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,760
 John describes the relationship between these men in this way.

91
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:39,240
 He says that Jesus loved His disciples during His ministry on earth, and now He loved them to the end.

92
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,720
 And another version says that He showed them the full extent of His love.

93
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,440
 And of course we know at this dinner, the way that Jesus demonstrated His love

94
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,600
 was by taking off His robe and washing the disciples' feet.

95
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,800
 And then He told them to do the same.

96
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,680
 And then as they talked and Jesus was sharing more, you know, really what was pressing on His heart,

97
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,120
 this is the eve of His crucifixion, you know, and He tells them He's going away.

98
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,360
 And, you know, the disciples are all like, "Wait, where are you going?

99
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,880
 Show us the way."

100
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,560
 And Jesus does say something really interesting.

101
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,440
 He says, "You do know the way."

102
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,320
 And He said, "I am the way."

103
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,760
 You know, the disciples wanted instructions.

104
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,800
 They wanted directions to follow Jesus, but Jesus actually gave them Himself.

105
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,880
 And so in the end, you know, it came down to love.

106
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,840
 It came down to relationship.

107
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,000
 And of course we know He went to the cross the next day.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,800
 And when we think of the cross, you know, we think about Jesus dying.

109
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,000
 We think about how that brought us salvation.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,440
 But actually, the way that John says in that really well-known verse that most of us know,

111
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,560
 "For God so loved the world that He gave us salvation."

112
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,600
 No, it doesn't say that.

113
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,120
 It says that God demonstrated His love for us.

114
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,520
 He loved the world, so He gave us His one and only Son.

115
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,720
 So the cross isn't primarily about salvation.

116
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:19,440
 It's really about love and Jesus, or Jesus giving Himself, and the Father giving us Jesus in love.

117
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,760
 I think this is kind of an interesting thing to bring up that perhaps is something we don't reflect on a lot,

118
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,480
 which is the idea that actually we have this God who offers Himself,

119
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,160
 like not offering a ministry or offering even the church.

120
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,040
 The church was a beautiful thing that came, but Jesus gave us Himself

121
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,240
 and still continues to give of Himself today.

122
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,880
 How do you think Jesus was able to do that?

123
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,560
 What was it about—now, we know Jesus was the Son of God,

124
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,160
 but what was it about Jesus that enabled Him to kind of offer Himself

125
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,720
 in this kind of self-sacrificial way to those that He truly loved?

126
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,880
 And what can we see in that that might encourage us as we think about doing that for one another?

127
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,200
 Yeah, you know, He was able to do that because He knew who He was.

128
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,600
 But first I want to talk about how practicing life-giving relationships with one another,

129
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,160
 it really flows out of practicing life-giving relationship with Jesus.

130
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,680
 You know, in keeping the greatest commandment to love God and to love others as we love ourselves,

131
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,080
 you know, the action is love, but that action comes from us.

132
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,800
 You know, we love God, we love others, and we love ourselves.

133
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,320
 And like the rest of the law, you know, even though God tells us and requires it of us,

134
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,120
 we will fall short because our love is flawed.

135
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,080
 Our love will fall short.

136
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,640
 So after Jesus demonstrated His love for His disciples, He gave them a new commandment.

137
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,000
 And the new commandment says, "Love one another," the same, you know, action is love,

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,040
 but He said, "As I have loved you, so you must love one another."

139
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,720
 So the new commandment gives us the power to obey the greatest commandment

140
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,080
 because Jesus shows us the way of love.

141
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,560
 You know, we don't have to find that love from within ourselves

142
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,920
 because that love will already be in us if we receive it from Jesus.

143
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,680
 So our ability to love is really rooted in Jesus.

144
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,800
 And then, like I said, He was able to do that because He knew who He was.

145
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,000
 You know, John says that before Jesus washed the disciples' feet,

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,080
 he says a little bit earlier in the passage that Jesus knew the Father had put all things

147
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,440
 under His power and that He had come from God and that He was returning to God.

148
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,760
 And so He got up and He was able to wash the disciples' feet.

149
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,640
 You know, Jesus was able to humble Himself because He knew who He was.

150
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:06,560
 He was rooted deeply in the Father's love for Him and the relationships that they had together.

151
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,800
 Yeah, I think it's really interesting.

152
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,200
 Pastor Tim spoke to us last week on love and love in community.

153
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,360
 And now you're kind of picking up on that same sort of idea of,

154
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,760
 you know, because we have received His love, we're able to love one another.

155
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,520
 And really, in many ways, spiritual friendships is this kind of sense, isn't it,

156
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,120
 of actually walking in love with one another,

157
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,520
 but doing so in a way that actually sort of gives ourselves to that person.

158
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,720
 And I think this is also then ironically one of the challenges of spiritual friendships,

159
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,800
 because it is about me giving myself to you or whoever it is that I'm walking in relationship with.

160
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,120
 But you know what? That sounds exhausting.

161
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,960
 You know, it sounds tiring.

162
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,160
 Like we're already feeling it, aren't we, from this whole kind of COVID situation.

163
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,920
 We're all a little bit tired and burnt out.

164
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,880
 And now you're asking us to enter into a relationship where I have to give myself to somebody else.

165
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,000
 What are some of the reflections you have around that?

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 For those that might be watching this right now and kind of freaking out a little bit,

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,040
 that we're asking them to give even more of themselves in a time when they're already quite tired.

168
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,960
 Yeah, no, I agree. It can sound challenging,

169
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:16,800
 especially if we feel like we have to dig deep and find that, you know, find what we need to give away.

170
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,920
 You know, let me tell you a little bit about my story.

171
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,400
 You know, I am an introvert, naturally.

172
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,160
 And so I often feel awkward around people.

173
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,840
 And I sometimes in relationship, I don't even know where to begin.

174
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,480
 And just like everybody else, you know, the past couple of years,

175
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,440
 I really did experience a lot of anxiety and stress.

176
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,880
 And, you know, the collective trauma that we experience,

177
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,520
 I really brought up for me the trauma from my childhood.

178
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:55,000
 And so last fall, when I was already feeling so overwhelmed and frankly, I was really just physically exhausted.

179
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,640
 And around that time, you know, my husband, Sam, and I were wrestling with a decision to move out of Hong Kong.

180
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,320
 And it wasn't moving to go back home to where our family is.

181
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,680
 It was really to go to a new country.

182
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,680
 And just that whole that whole situation just really pushed me close to burnout.

183
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,680
 And so I reached out, you know, I knew I needed help.

184
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,920
 I reached out to professionals, but really it wasn't enough for me.

185
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,960
 Because I felt that I wanted someone who loved me.

186
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,760
 I wanted someone who could see me.

187
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:39,000
 And so I reached out to a really close friend that I meet with regularly.

188
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,760
 And I said, look, this is where I'm at right now.

189
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,320
 I just laid it all out.

190
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,360
 And I said, how would you feel if we took our friendship to the next level?

191
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,760
 And, you know, would you look into my life?

192
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,640
 And I gave her permission to speak honestly, to speak truth.

193
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,560
 And really in return, I offered really more access to my heart.

194
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,040
 But also that I would do the same in return for her.

195
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,480
 And so, you know, it's interesting.

196
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:20,360
 I really want to make the point that even though I was seeking healing at that time, I knew it wasn't about my healing.

197
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,120
 Because I knew then I would really be tempted to make it about myself.

198
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,240
 Right, yeah, exactly.

199
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,480
 So my goal really was to go deeper into love.

200
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,440
 Because I knew the deeper I experienced love, that the more healing I would experience.

201
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:44,840
 And I also knew that the more healing I experienced, that I would be better at loving myself, loving God and loving others.

202
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,800
 I think you pick up on something there that I see as key, and that is courage.

203
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,840
 You know, everything you just spoke about with your own story, and thanks for sharing your personal story with us today.

204
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,800
 That takes a huge amount of courage to say to someone, "Hey, we've been friends for a while, but I actually need you.

205
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,320
 I need you at a deeper level.

206
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,520
 I need you to love me.

207
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,880
 I need to open my... and I want to take that courageous step to open my life towards you."

208
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,120
 That's not an easy thing, but I think that is such an important catalyst to spiritual friendship.

209
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:24,280
 It reminds me of the story in Mark chapter 2, and it's quite a well-known story of Jesus returning to Capernaum.

210
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,720
 And there He is in a house, doing a house meeting, and these friends make a hole in the roof.

211
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,480
 And they kind of let down their buddy who's on a stretcher down before Jesus' feet.

212
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:43,600
 And when you read that story, it's such a beautiful picture, really, of the care and the concern that these four friends on the roof have for the person on the stretcher.

213
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,800
 And Jesus looks up and sees their incredible faith, and because of that faith, He responds.

214
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,080
 But what I think about that story is, so often we actually think of ourselves as the guys on the roof.

215
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,600
 It's like, "I want to be the person on the roof. Like, who? I've got this great faith that's like healing my friend."

216
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,160
 When actually, a lot of times, we're the person on the stretcher.

217
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,440
 And it's the courage to say—and I think in that Bible story, you see both elements of what spiritual friendships is about.

218
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,520
 And this is one of the beautiful things about it, right?

219
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,600
 Let's say you and I are in a spiritual friendship relationship.

220
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,480
 There's going to be seasons where you're like you've just described.

221
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,520
 You're facing a really tough life choice, a decision. You're feeling burnout.

222
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,680
 I'm going to be the person on the roof, letting you down before Jesus, and speaking life over you, and praying for you.

223
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,560
 But in just another month's time or so, I know I'm going to be the person on the stretcher.

224
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,920
 I'm going to need to then have you step in from where you're at.

225
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,000
 And I think it's that kind of partnership together of being able to really honor each other.

226
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,640
 You're not always—spiritual friendships is not always about giving out towards the other.

227
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,560
 It's also about that place of receiving.

228
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,120
 And sometimes, when we're like the paralytic, when we're on the stretcher itself,

229
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,280
 we desperately need those people to reach out to us.

230
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:01,000
 And maybe ironically, I know that you've had your own physical kind of story recently of kind of being on the stretcher.

231
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Do you want to tell us a bit about that?

232
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,280
 So, about a month ago, I had surgery on both of my feet, which, you know, I don't advise it.

233
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,880
 Both at the same time. That's smart, Sarah. Nice one.

234
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
 But one recovery.

235
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,800
 So, I, you know, literally, I still have trouble walking right now, and I need lots of help.

236
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,360
 But especially in that first week when my feet were just in so much pain,

237
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:34,680
 and I literally just had to sit all day with my feet propped up, and just really aware of the pain.

238
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:40,680
 And at that time, I was thinking a lot about Jesus washing the disciples' feet.

239
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:46,120
 And it was just the most intimate experience.

240
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:54,840
 I can't even really describe it, but I experienced Jesus holding my wounded feet in his hands,

241
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,840
 like, all day long.

242
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,520
 And it really was life-changing for me.

243
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:11,800
 And I think I just realized in those days that I need, I don't just want to experience Jesus' love for me, I need it.

244
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,920
 I need to walk in that kind of connection with Jesus.

245
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,480
 Because without him, without receiving that from him, I really couldn't do anything.

246
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,920
 And then, as I continue to heal, you know, I'm still depending a lot on my friends and family.

247
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,120
 And I'm still, you know, quite frankly, I'm still healing from my burnout.

248
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,200
 I've just been realizing that I need to walk.

249
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,080
 I don't just want to walk. I need to walk with others in humble, vulnerable interdependence.

250
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:53,880
 And it's kind of ironic because in this time when I can do so little for myself, I can do so little for other people,

251
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:02,840
 I feel like I'm learning so much about what it means to experience love and give love in return.

252
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,280
 And I have these crutches I have to use.

253
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:13,080
 And the doctor said, "Even if you don't feel like you need it, always use them when you go in public."

254
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,720
 Because they're like a physical, visual reminder that I'm delicate, I'm vulnerable,

255
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,920
 and that, you know, please be gentle around me.

256
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:29,240
 So, it's really like wearing my vulnerability on the outside, you know, which has been really a blessing.

257
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,640
 It's humbling, but it's a blessing to do that.

258
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,840
 Well, let me pull together some of the threads actually of this time

259
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,560
 and what we've been talking about just to help us to kind of track along, I think,

260
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,560
 with some of what Sarah is sharing.

261
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,200
 You know, we're talking about the reality that spiritual friendships are about relationship.

262
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,800
 They're about love being at the center of those relationships.

263
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,600
 We talked about how that love is given to us by God.

264
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,320
 There's a storehouse, a reservoir of that love that we receive in order to give.

265
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,760
 We talked about how spiritual friendships are about self-sacrifice towards the other,

266
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,000
 and also about courage and vulnerability.

267
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 They're about us being courageous enough to say, "You know what? I need help. I need some support in this time."

268
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,240
 And us also realizing that when we have those trusted relationships with others,

269
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,040
 that they're also going to be there for us in those moments where we need them as well.

270
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,480
 And so, it's not just all about giving, but it is also about receiving.

271
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,440
 And in that sort of cooperative relationship, we're able to then really give to one another

272
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,200
 that kind of love and support that really the Scriptures speak about.

273
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,600
 So, we covered quite a lot of ground, I think, in terms of the theory of what spiritual friendships is

274
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,120
 and some of the important elements of that and how we see that in Jesus.

275
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,720
 What about some practical tips?

276
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,080
 What are some ways that you would suggest we can practically maybe start some of these relationships?

277
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,560
 Perhaps some who are watching this right now, they already have these relationships in their lives,

278
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,520
 or maybe they don't.

279
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,480
 So, what's really some practical tips you'd share?

280
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,440
 Well, the most important tip I can give is just to show up.

281
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,760
 Show up and begin.

282
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,240
 And, you know, we've lost so much control over many things in our life,

283
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,520
 but there are things within our control that we can begin with.

284
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,680
 So, I would say begin with yourself.

285
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
 Begin where you are, not where you're not.

286
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,120
 Don't worry about that.

287
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,240
 And begin today.

288
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,440
 Don't put it off.

289
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,160
 You know, every one of us has the power to cultivate deeper friendships

290
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,400
 instead of waiting for them to happen.

291
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,080
 So, you know, maybe you feel like you need help yourself.

292
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,520
 You know, you can begin with your friendship with Jesus.

293
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,640
 He's already passionate about having a relationship with you.

294
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,880
 He's already given himself to you.

295
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,600
 So, you know, invite him into your need.

296
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,280
 Let him come to you and let him fill your love tank.

297
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,360
 And maybe some people watching are ready to take action.

298
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:59,080
 You know, I would say think about how you can be the kind of friend that you want to have.

299
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:05,480
 And, you know, for example, if you want to have more open, vulnerable sharing with your friend,

300
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,800
 think about like how can I, how can you cultivate that vulnerability within yourself?

301
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,400
 You know, in my own life, you know, right now in this area,

302
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,000
 I'm working on admitting my mistakes.

303
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,800
 So…

304
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,360
 I don't have any of those.

305
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,240
 Not you, but me.

306
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,440
 Okay, you. You're talking about you.

307
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,080
 Carry on.

308
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,560
 Yeah, so, you know, not only admitting them to myself and to other people,

309
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,400
 but letting Jesus again come into it and walk with me in it.

310
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,960
 That's something that's been really precious to me these days.

311
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,840
 So, and like me, like what I did with my friend,

312
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,280
 maybe you already have a friendship that you really want to take to the next level.

313
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,880
 Maybe you can have a conversation with that friend to, you know, talk about what can you do?

314
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,400
 Can you meet more regularly?

315
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:57,960
 Can you share certain things that you haven't opened up until now and reserve judgment?

316
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,800
 Don't give advice, those kinds of things.

317
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,560
 I think it's a great thought about not giving judgment, you know,

318
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,080
 and I think if you've got a trusted friend like that, then that's really a possibility.

319
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,880
 You can do that and know that they're going to hold that judgment back

320
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,240
 and just pray for you and love on you.

321
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,560
 So, hey, you know, as we've been doing each week,

322
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,440
 we also want to tell you about the toolkit that is available

323
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,040
 because everything we've been talking about today,

324
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,200
 we've captured the essence of this in our Spiritual Formation Toolkit.

325
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,160
 Again, you can go to vineschurch.live/resources and you can find it there.

326
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,840
 But in this particular section under Spiritual Friendships that we're releasing today,

327
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,600
 there are two segments.

328
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,320
 There's the action steps and going deeper.

329
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,800
 And we just want to tell you about a couple of the things that you can use this toolkit for

330
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,440
 immediately to deepen these friendships in your life.

331
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,120
 In the action steps, there's this one called sharing your life story.

332
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,240
 And this is something actually that I've made a practice with some of my friends over the years.

333
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,080
 And I call it the one-hour walk.

334
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,400
 So, what you do is you start in some location with your friend

335
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,040
 and then for half an hour, you walk in one direction.

336
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,480
 It doesn't matter where, but you walk forward in a direction for half an hour.

337
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,440
 And only one person speaks during that half an hour.

338
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,680
 And that's the person sharing their life story.

339
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,240
 And they're talking about all the things that they might want to talk about,

340
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,920
 about what's happened in their lives, how they've grown and developed as a human being.

341
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,520
 And the other person is just listening.

342
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,120
 And when you get to the 30-minute mark,

343
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,680
 you turn around and you walk back to where you started.

344
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,520
 And it's the other person's time to speak.

345
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,640
 And they get to share their life story and you get to listen.

346
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,960
 And again, it's all about practicing active listening.

347
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,880
 It's not about judging or making comment.

348
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,480
 It's just about listening.

349
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,160
 And when you get to the end of that hour, you find a coffee shop, you sit down,

350
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,120
 and you tell each other what you heard in their story.

351
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,840
 And trust me, I've done this a number of times, as I've said.

352
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,600
 And it's such a powerful thing to be able to get to know somebody deeper.

353
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,200
 But you'll also be amazed about what people hear in your story.

354
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,880
 And they're able often to point out things that perhaps you never would have thought of

355
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,400
 that God has been doing in your life.

356
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,640
 And they're like, "Hey, did you recognize that you shared this?

357
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,920
 And I was so encouraged by that."

358
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,920
 So, the one-hour walk, I can't recommend it enough.

359
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,160
 What else is in that action steps segment?

360
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,000
 Yeah, you know, we talked about being vulnerable and open and honest,

361
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,840
 and that it takes courage, right?

362
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,520
 So, in the toolkit, there's a link to this book called Daring Greatly by Brené Brown.

363
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,720
 And it really shares stories and just really heartfelt stories,

364
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,160
 even personal stories from the author and research about openness and vulnerability.

365
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,840
 And I can't recommend this book enough, you know.

366
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,040
 It's really important to learn to be vulnerable, to live lives,

367
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,520
 and also to have relationships of significance.

368
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,400
 We also have a teaching series that we did at the Vine a number of years ago

369
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,480
 on spiritual friendships.

370
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,400
 I think it's a four or five-week series.

371
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,440
 That's also linked in the action steps segment.

372
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,120
 And if you haven't listened to those talks,

373
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,640
 there's a lot of deeper teaching, as well as practical advice

374
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,240
 contained in that teaching series.

375
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,200
 So, that's something I definitely encourage you guys to check out.

376
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,080
 Yeah, and also in the action steps,

377
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,000
 there's some information about how to be a safe person for another person.

378
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And you mentioned active listening.

379
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,160
 You know, there's some information and tips about active listening.

380
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,000
 You know, most of us don't listen very well to other people.

381
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,440
 And so, look at the resources to put into practice

382
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,600
 some of the things we've been talking about this morning.

383
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,320
 Yeah, and finally, there's a going deeper section.

384
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,400
 And the going deeper section really just highlights something

385
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,040
 that I think is so important in spiritual friendships.

386
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
 Not something we've been able to talk much about today,

387
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,440
 but something we definitely want to encourage you to read about.

388
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,560
 And that's boundaries.

389
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,320
 You know, we talked a lot about self-sacrifice and giving of yourself,

390
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,600
 but there's also the appropriate boundaries in which you do that.

391
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,520
 And sometimes you've got to create those boundaries

392
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,240
 and make sure that those boundaries are clearly communicated

393
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,920
 and to respect one another's boundaries and confidentiality

394
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,160
 in your spiritual friendship relationship.

395
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,640
 So, in the going deeper section, we talk a little bit more about that.

396
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,440
 Sarah, it's been so great to be able to spend this time together today.

397
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,560
 And I know that many of you guys watching from home,

398
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,640
 you've been welcomed into this kind of conversation.

399
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,840
 Sarah's really opened up a lot about her own personal life

400
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,520
 and how she's had to journey through this.

401
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,120
 We've talked about those relationships, about love,

402
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,040
 about the reality of the self-sacrifice, about the courage and vulnerability.

403
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,800
 We've shared some of those practical tips.

404
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,600
 We've pointed you forward into the toolkit.

405
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,640
 So, our heart is really that all of that has really spurred some inspiration in you.

406
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,480
 You know, that's the point of doing this Flourish series here

407
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,520
 at the beginning of the year.

408
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,160
 We want to inspire you to really think about

409
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,720
 how you're deepening your spiritual foundations in 2021

410
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,080
 and who you are deepening those spiritual foundations with.

411
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,840
 And that's what spiritual friendships are.

412
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,640
 They're choosing a few people to go deeper in your maturity with Christ,

413
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,440
 getting the support that you need and the love that can be encountered

414
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,480
 through another human being, being Christ to you

415
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,120
 in some of the hardest moments of your life.

416
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,160
 So, thanks, Sarah, so much again for being here.

417
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,440
 And I know it would be a blessing for all of us if you just spent some time

418
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,280
 maybe just praying over us as a church and praying into us

419
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,200
 as we all seek to step out a little bit deeper in these relationships.

420
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,160
 Sure. Yeah.

421
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:29,480
 Father, Abba, we are so grateful that, first of all, you love us,

422
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,920
 but you didn't love us from afar.

423
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,760
 You demonstrated your love for us.

424
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:43,000
 And you gave up to us the most precious thing to yourself, which was your son.

425
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:52,520
 So, Lord, we really just want to open ourselves to receive from you

426
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,280
 this incredible love that you have for us.

427
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:03,080
 And we just ask that you would, just every person in this room,

428
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,000
 but also watching, Lord, that you would just pour out this love

429
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,720
 that we can feel it tangibly in our lives, Lord.

430
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,080
 We really can't do things without you, Lord.

431
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,720
 We can't be the kind of friend.

432
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,320
 We can't be the kind of spouse or mom or daughter or son

433
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,720
 that we want to be from within ourself, Lord.

434
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,600
 We need you.

435
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,400
 And so thank you for giving yourself.

436
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,360
 We receive you.

437
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,960
 We love you.

438
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,360
 Lord, would you just unleash compassion and freedom in us

439
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,240
 as we receive from you, Lord.

440
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,800
 Bless our relationships.

441
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,160
 Bless our families, Lord.

442
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,600
 We thank you, Lord.

443
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,520
 In Jesus name.
