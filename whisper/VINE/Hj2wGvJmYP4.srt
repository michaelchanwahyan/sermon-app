1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 In Genesis 3, when Adam and Eve take that fruit

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,360
 that they were told not to eat and they ate it.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,760
 Scripture says that their eyes were opened

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,200
 and they realized that they were naked

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,300
 and they were ashamed.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,720
 And then you fast forward in Scripture many, many years

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,120
 to the death and resurrection of Jesus

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,460
 and those two disciples walking on the road

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,460
 after the resurrection of Jesus.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,160
 And they're talking about what's just happened in Jerusalem

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,960
 trying to get their heads around it.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,920
 Scriptures say that Jesus comes alongside of them

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,720
 and has that conversation with them.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,480
 And then they sit down at the end of the day

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,000
 with this stranger, they don't know who he truly is.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,560
 And he brings them around the communion table,

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,400
 what we've just shared together as a fellowship.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,160
 And as they break bread and they share the cup,

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,880
 the Bible says that these two disciples,

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,280
 their eyes were opened and they were able to see Jesus

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,520
 for who he truly was.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,040
 And there's this beautiful sort of balance in Scripture

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,680
 between sin opening our eyes to horror and terror

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
 and darkness and chaos.

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,960
 And yet Jesus' sacrifice, his death and resurrection

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,360
 opening our eyes to his glory, to who he truly is.

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,480
 We now get to stand on that side of the resurrection

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,560
 and I wanna encourage you in this room

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
 that we've just been singing that song,

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,960
 Dead Things to Life.

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,120
 And I feel like some of us as we're singing that song,

32
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,240
 our eyes were closed to the beauty

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,560
 that God has put all around us.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,600
 That our eyes are perhaps closed at this time

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,240
 to the hope that there is in a situation

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,360
 that you're struggling with.

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,680
 Sometimes the enemy will close our eyes,

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,040
 keep us blind from the goodness of God.

39
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,840
 This is why so many times in Scripture,

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,600
 a person of God has to declare,

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,560
 I will see the goodness of God in the land of the living.

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,800
 I wanna speak out over you

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,560
 that no matter how dark it might seem for you at times,

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,360
 that there is hope, that Jesus is here present.

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,880
 And sometimes we need our eyes open to see him.

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,720
 We get to celebrate in just a few moments,

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,840
 21 people getting baptized down in Repulse Bay Beach

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,720
 as a symbol really of their eyes being open

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,280
 to seeing Jesus more fully.

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,440
 And I wonder whether you just in this moment

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,120
 want your eyes to be opened again,

52
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,520
 to see him for who he truly is in your life

53
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,760
 and all the things that are happening.

54
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,680
 So I wonder whether you just open your hands with me

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
 as I pray for us.

56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,360
 Father, I pray for each person in this room.

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,640
 Lord, the eyes of our hearts, Lord,

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,200
 can be often shut to the work of your glory

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
 and goodness and beauty in our lives.

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,800
 (gentle music)

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,880
 And Lord, we know that you paid that price on the cross,

62
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,000
 rose again so that we would know forgiveness

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,240
 and grace and mercy and new life.

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,520
 So just like those two disciples around that table,

65
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,480
 our eyes would be open and we could see you,

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,000
 see the hope that there is in you,

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,280
 see the life that comes in you,

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
 see the forgiveness and experience that

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,760
 that comes from your mercy and your grace,

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
 like those who are getting baptized today

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,160
 are testifying too.

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,720
 And Lord, I pray for each person here

73
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,360
 who's going through a dark time,

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,760
 where struggle or suffering or strife or tiredness

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,760
 or just whatever it is, it's just overwhelming.

76
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
 Lord, I wanna pray for the opening of eyes today.

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,640
 Lord, you don't guarantee that you're gonna pull us

78
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,040
 magically out of all of the bad stuff,

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,920
 but you do help us to lift our eyes up to see you,

80
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,880
 to know where our help comes from.

81
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,760
 You come and walk beside us as we go through

82
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,440
 the valley of the shadow of death.

83
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,680
 You take our hands and you show us what you've placed

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,200
 in them for your glory in this time.

85
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
 So Lord, for whoever it might be in this room,

86
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,440
 wherever they might be that they're struggling or in need,

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,080
 would you open their eyes, Holy Spirit, now

88
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,680
 to your presence and your goodness,

89
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,320
 to your faithfulness, Lord.

90
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,560
 And we declare as a church, as the psalmist would,

91
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,520
 that we will see the goodness of the Lord

92
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,200
 in the land of the living,

93
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,120
 that in this place, in all of its faults,

94
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,400
 in all of its struggles, in Hong Kong,

95
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,920
 in this time, in this hour, just like Jethro led us to pray,

96
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,240
 we will see the goodness of God in this city.

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,320
 Lord, I open our eyes to the majestic things

98
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
 that you're doing.

99
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,320
 And then they call us to partner with you in those things

100
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,120
 so that they would be for your name,

101
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,120
 your fame and your glory.

102
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,360
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

103
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,320
 Everyone says, amen.

104
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,440
 We put our hands together for our worship team.

105
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,080
 So grateful for them.

106
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,320
 Welcome to the Vine, have a seat.

107
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,960
 Welcome, welcome, if you're here for the first time,

108
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,960
 we're so glad you are here.

109
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,920
 If you're joining us because maybe a friend

110
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,400
 or a family member is getting baptized,

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,080
 we're also so glad you're with us today.

112
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,480
 My name is Andrew.

113
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,320
 All right, how we doing?

114
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,160
 There you go.

115
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,000
 My name is Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here,

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,100
 and it's great.

117
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,700
 We're in week two of a short two-week series

118
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,080
 on the biblical vision of beauty.

119
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,360
 And we started off last week really trying to unpack

120
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,000
 the theological foundations of beauty.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,360
 And we talked about last week

122
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,800
 how there's this interesting phenomenon

123
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,360
 where beauty and suffering so often go together.

124
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,020
 We talked last week about the reality

125
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,920
 that we often wanna bring flowers to a funeral,

126
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,520
 or we wanna write a beautiful get well card

127
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,260
 to someone who's in the hospital.

128
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,260
 We have this innate desire in us to partner beauty

129
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,120
 and suffering alongside of each other.

130
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,160
 And I gave us a provocative question last week.

131
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,620
 I said, if that's the case,

132
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,320
 then could it be actually that beauty could save the world?

133
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,520
 And we said last week that, well,

134
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080
 perhaps not the beauty that we normally think of

135
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,060
 when we hear the word beauty.

136
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,200
 You know, the subjective, aesthetic,

137
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,960
 eye of the beholder kind of beauty,

138
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,920
 the sort of beauty where everybody has an opinion

139
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,760
 as to whether something is beautiful or ugly.

140
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,920
 And when you look at beauty in that way,

141
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,760
 you might be forgiven for thinking like,

142
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,880
 how can there be any hope in that kind of flimsy beauty?

143
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,440
 That there can't be surely any way

144
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,840
 that that type of beauty could impact suffering.

145
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,480
 And so I challenged this last week

146
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,760
 that perhaps the way we define beauty is wrong.

147
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,040
 Perhaps the way that the world considers and looks at beauty

148
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,000
 is actually not the way that the scriptures speak

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,820
 of what beauty truly is.

150
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,680
 And so we went on a little journey last week

151
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,200
 of opening up the Old Testament and the New Testament

152
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,920
 for this concept of beauty.

153
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,560
 And we saw that beauty has actually a lot less

154
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,640
 to do with aesthetic subjectiveness

155
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,200
 and much more to do with objective goodness.

156
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,920
 That beauty as scripture defines it

157
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,280
 is about splendor and majesty and wonder and mystery.

158
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,420
 And ultimately always pointing us

159
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,360
 towards the concept of glory.

160
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,660
 That beauty speaks of the reality

161
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,400
 that there is a divine objective goodness in the world

162
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,720
 that's been woven into the fabric of creation.

163
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,040
 And we can know that kind of beauty

164
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,340
 and that beauty can set us free.

165
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,840
 We looked at the reality of that beauty,

166
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,440
 didn't we last week in Genesis one and two.

167
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,840
 And we said that we see this beautiful picture

168
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,160
 right at the beginning of scripture

169
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,140
 on what beauty is all about.

170
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,140
 We saw a formless, dark and shapeless world

171
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,560
 but the Holy Spirit hovering over it,

172
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,000
 waiting to bring it into life.

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,360
 And then as God speaks, let there be life,

174
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,160
 we see that God in his creative goodness

175
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 creates the world, brings order out of that place of chaos.

176
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,720
 And at the end of every day of that creativeness

177
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,680
 of taking something that is chaotic

178
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,360
 and bringing it into a place of order,

179
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,860
 God stands back and says, this is good.

180
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,540
 The actual Hebrew word there is the same word for beauty.

181
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,960
 This is beautiful.

182
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,200
 It's beautiful because what was chaotic

183
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,760
 now has order and structure and shalom and peace to it.

184
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,480
 And we saw last week that the culmination

185
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,840
 of that creation is humanity made in God's image.

186
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,720
 In other words, we are made beautiful in him

187
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,920
 so that we can then partner with God

188
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,220
 in the outworking of beauty in the world.

189
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,580
 But we see what happens in Genesis three,

190
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,000
 where humanity through its choice to sin in that moment

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,480
 takes the world back into a place of chaos.

192
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,680
 And the rest of scripture really is the big question

193
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,000
 of can we ever know and encounter beauty again?

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,340
 Like would order ever come to the chaos that sits in us?

195
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,120
 We said last week that of course Jesus is that answer,

196
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,960
 isn't he?

197
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,320
 His life, his death, his resurrection.

198
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,040
 He's the one who comes to create that order in us again.

199
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,920
 And as we see the work of the cross

200
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,980
 and the way that Christ sheds his blood

201
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,540
 so we would know redemption of our sin,

202
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,300
 so that we would come into a place of order again with him,

203
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,980
 forgiveness and mercy and grace

204
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,220
 so that we can live a new creation as Paul speaks of it.

205
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,480
 As we see that journey,

206
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,700
 we get to understand the power of the glory of God.

207
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,660
 And we receive then the calling on us as his people

208
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,060
 to be those people that can walk out that glory

209
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,060
 in the world around us.

210
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,940
 So I said to us last week that the definition,

211
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,980
 a biblical definition of beauty is this,

212
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,340
 that beauty is the objective creative work of God

213
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,700
 to bring order out of chaos.

214
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,500
 Making sense, still with me?

215
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,740
 That that is the journey that God is in in our lives.

216
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,300
 That's what he's done in each one of us.

217
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,900
 And so I can stand before you today

218
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,100
 looking at every single one of you in this room and online,

219
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,820
 and I can say you are beautiful.

220
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,620
 I mean, you really are beautiful.

221
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,060
 And I can give you two biblical reasons why

222
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,900
 when you woke up this morning and looked in that mirror,

223
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,400
 you don't see ugliness, but you should see beauty.

224
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,900
 Because you are one that God has taken by his spirit

225
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,220
 and has begun to rejuvenate by the work of his power

226
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,120
 and his mercy in your life.

227
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,980
 You are one who was chaotic in your sin

228
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,860
 and now is walking in a place of sanctification.

229
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,980
 It's just a biblical word.

230
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,820
 That means we're going from one aspect of glory

231
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,340
 to the next, becoming more and more like his son, Jesus.

232
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,980
 Ephesians 4 welcomes us, doesn't it,

233
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,380
 into this beautiful invitation that we would know

234
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,900
 the wholeness of the wholeness of Christ.

235
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,500
 And so you are beautiful because the spirit of God

236
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,460
 is at work in your chaos,

237
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,300
 bringing you into a place of order.

238
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,860
 Does that make sense?

239
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,380
 But you're also beautiful because God has called you

240
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,340
 not just to be one who receives the work of beauty

241
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,060
 in your life, but one who actually then commits yourself

242
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,300
 to living out acts of beauty in the world.

243
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,540
 In other words, you're not just saved

244
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,540
 so you would know order.

245
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,260
 You're called by God as a human being

246
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,660
 to now be one who goes into the world

247
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,340
 and brings the offer and the hope of that order

248
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,900
 for them themselves.

249
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,340
 And there are 21 people getting baptized today

250
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,020
 who can testify that somebody somewhere in their life

251
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,460
 has shared the good hope of Jesus with them

252
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,260
 and they're moving into the waters.

253
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,740
 We go down into the waters of baptism

254
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,020
 to say that we go down into that darkness

255
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,620
 that we used to have and we come up out of it

256
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,260
 washed clean by the hope of Jesus.

257
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,340
 That, my friends, is beauty.

258
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,100
 And we come out of it clean,

259
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,160
 not so that we can just get our ticket to heaven

260
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,620
 and be more holy people.

261
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,020
 We come out of it now with a mandate

262
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,700
 that we ourselves are called to go into the world

263
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,140
 with evangelism and mission and hope

264
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,780
 to share the good beautifulness of God in our lives

265
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,740
 with everyone around us.

266
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,780
 That's the journey of the Christian life.

267
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,360
 So let me say this to you,

268
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,460
 and it's really important you hear this.

269
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,460
 Christians should be curators of beauty.

270
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,340
 I mean, we are the ones who go into the world

271
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,180
 and announce what is beautiful

272
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,980
 by partnering with the Holy Spirit

273
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,980
 to do acts that bring goodness and peace and shalom

274
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,060
 to all of the chaos around us.

275
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,060
 That's what we've been invited into, friends.

276
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,540
 That call came right at the beginning in Genesis 2

277
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,500
 where he said, "I want you to go and steward

278
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,120
 "all of creation.

279
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,600
 "You can see what's beautiful around you.

280
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,540
 "Now go and be my beauty in the world."

281
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,300
 And that same calling now sits on us today

282
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,960
 that we get to move into the world

283
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,960
 offering the hope of Jesus, doing acts of beauty,

284
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,940
 speaking life where there is chaos,

285
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,920
 bringing light where there is darkness,

286
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,900
 participating with the hope of God.

287
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,420
 Now that's really good news.

288
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,600
 That's really good news right now for the city of Hong Kong.

289
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,860
 A theologian once put this whole work of beauty like this.

290
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,780
 He says, "God gave us grain and grapes,

291
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,140
 "and in return we give him bread and wine."

292
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,180
 There's a participation with the Holy Spirit

293
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,900
 in taking the things that God has done in our lives

294
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,380
 and creating something that can show the world

295
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,820
 the beauty and the glory of God.

296
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,780
 And I think if that's true,

297
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,700
 then us Christians need to lean in

298
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,460
 perhaps more than anyone else

299
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,780
 to the creative impulses that are placed in us.

300
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,100
 That those creative impulses

301
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,820
 that cause us to want to create something,

302
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,460
 do something, say something, help somebody,

303
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,100
 pause for a moment in our offices,

304
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,940
 walk with someone, listen to them,

305
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,060
 look at the things that are happening around us

306
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,100
 and try to bring some goodness and peace

307
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,300
 and shalom into the world.

308
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,140
 Why?

309
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,240
 Because to do so is a sacramental act, much like communion.

310
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,060
 To partner with the Holy Spirit

311
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,540
 to see more hope and joy and peace and life

312
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,340
 come into the world is sacramental.

313
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,780
 It's taking something that is an earthy action

314
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,860
 and partnering with the divine objective goodness of God

315
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,380
 to create something that was not there before.

316
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,900
 And when we do that, we are bringing beauty into the world.

317
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,940
 And here's your mandate.

318
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,100
 Here's what it means for you to be alive in Hong Kong

319
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,220
 in 2021.

320
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,900
 And you are gifted in so many ways,

321
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,740
 but your primary goal

322
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,120
 is to be a creator of beauty in the world.

323
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,460
 And some of you are sitting there thinking,

324
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,780
 I'm not very creative.

325
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,860
 Like, I don't know, I'm not really very creative at all.

326
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,340
 Remember what we said last week,

327
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,360
 untangling a child's knotted hair with a hairbrush

328
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,500
 is taking chaos and bringing in the order.

329
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,780
 Being willing to sit with someone

330
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,940
 that you're broken in relationship with

331
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,660
 and doing your best to reconcile that relationship with them

332
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,320
 is bringing beauty into the world.

333
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,640
 In many small and large ways,

334
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,980
 we get to contribute creatively with the Holy Spirit

335
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,980
 to see this world change and grow.

336
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,980
 And if all of this is true, guess what?

337
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,980
 The church is the best positioned organization

338
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,960
 and family and community in the world

339
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,940
 to be able to bring beauty,

340
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,660
 the healing balm of beauty to a broken community.

341
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,620
 I mean, there is nothing else in this world

342
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,540
 that is better primed and ready

343
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,340
 to administrate the healing beauty

344
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,300
 of God's love to the world.

345
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,900
 I mean, take a look at this moment right here,

346
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,800
 right now in this room.

347
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,220
 I mean, we have this space, don't we, which is such a gift.

348
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,940
 We have art all around us.

349
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,900
 Have a look at the posters that are in the stairwell

350
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,020
 on the way out.

351
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,380
 We have music that's created to enable us to worship.

352
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,100
 We have conversation and sharing.

353
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,740
 We have community with one another.

354
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,760
 All of those things can testify to the beauty of God

355
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,800
 and the Spirit's transformative work in us.

356
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,420
 But when I say that the church is most primed

357
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,820
 to bring the healing balm of beauty into the world,

358
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
 I'm not actually just talking about the 90 minutes

359
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,800
 of us gathering here on a Sunday.

360
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,660
 What I'm actually talking about is you,

361
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,380
 the incredible people that are sitting here

362
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,940
 and watching online right now,

363
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,860
 that each one of you is a gift of God's beauty.

364
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,300
 You are carrying in you a testimony

365
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,900
 of what the Holy Spirit has done in your life.

366
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,980
 And each one of you has gifts and talents and callings

367
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,020
 and are placed in spheres of influence.

368
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,060
 And if there is anyone who has ever been primed

369
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,800
 to make a difference in the world, surely it is us.

370
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,640
 We saw last week in Isaiah 61, verse three,

371
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,400
 that right at the end of that passage is a challenge.

372
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,280
 God says, "I'm gonna replace your ashes for beauty.

373
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,840
 "I'm gonna put beauty on you instead of ashes."

374
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,680
 Why?

375
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,740
 "So that you would be a planting of the Lord

376
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,200
 "for the display of His splendor."

377
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
 I want you to think about this.

378
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,160
 A planting of the Lord for a display of His splendor.

379
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,280
 Both of these things are important.

380
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,460
 If you are a Christian, you are a planting of the Lord.

381
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,320
 That God has done a transformative work in you.

382
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,480
 Paul would say, "Your old is gone, your new has come.

383
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,500
 "You've come out of the waters of baptism,

384
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,960
 "sanctified in Him.

385
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,680
 "You have new hope, new life.

386
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,620
 "The Spirit has regenerated you,

387
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,160
 "and you're walking now in glory to glory."

388
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,680
 That's the wonder of being a planting of the Lord.

389
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,940
 "But you're not just that," the writer of Isaiah says.

390
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,960
 "You're also that in order to display the glory of God."

391
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,660
 In other words, if all you do is get yourself saved

392
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,460
 and then hide in a little Christian bubble,

393
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,220
 then you're not actually the fullness

394
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,500
 of what God has called you to be.

395
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,660
 You are also not just a planting of the Lord,

396
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,620
 but to be displaying His glory to the world.

397
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,740
 A display of His glory.

398
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,420
 In other words, there's gotta be something you're doing

399
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,380
 or saying or acting or being

400
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,860
 that shows the sphere of influence around you

401
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,280
 that Christ has made a difference in your life.

402
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,740
 That's the wonder of what it is

403
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,700
 to call yourself a Christian,

404
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,280
 to hold the name of Christ in you.

405
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,700
 And this is such a gift.

406
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,140
 The early church was really passionate

407
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,700
 about Christians' understanding

408
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,020
 that they get to display the beauty,

409
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,480
 the glory of God to those around them.

410
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,900
 See, if evangelism and missions

411
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,980
 is about the glorification of God,

412
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,860
 about telling the world of God's glory,

413
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,680
 then we are never more beautiful

414
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,480
 than when we're actually outworking mission

415
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,160
 and evangelism in and through our lives.

416
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,120
 That's when we're most beautiful,

417
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,520
 when we're actually pointing people towards hope,

418
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,360
 pointing people towards the glory

419
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,240
 that God has placed in their lives.

420
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,840
 And this is what the early church writers

421
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,280
 were all focused on,

422
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,620
 wanting the church to know they're a planting of the Lord,

423
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,480
 but also a display of God's glory.

424
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,940
 Because if they didn't display His glory,

425
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,080
 how could the world know that there is hope?

426
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,060
 And could the greatest call

427
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,340
 in the church in Hong Kong right now

428
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,180
 be the need for us to be a display of the glory of God,

429
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,820
 because the world and this city

430
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,200
 desperately needs to find fresh hope?

431
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,740
 I wanna show you how Peter actually positions

432
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,180
 the call of the church into acts of beauty,

433
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,900
 in being the very people that Christ has saved them to be.

434
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,560
 This is Peter writing to the church.

435
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,940
 And he says this in 1 Peter 2, starting in verse one.

436
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,780
 He says, "Therefore,"

437
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,660
 he, by the way, he's just talked about the gospel,

438
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,740
 he's just talked about the saving power of Jesus.

439
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,420
 And he said, "Therefore, because of Jesus,

440
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,780
 "rid yourself of all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy,

441
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,100
 "envy, and slander of every kind.

442
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,480
 "Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk,

443
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,140
 "so that by it you may grow up,"

444
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,020
 notice this, "grow up in your salvation.

445
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,020
 "Now that you have tasted and seen that the Lord is good."

446
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,740
 I want you to follow what Peter is saying here.

447
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,540
 He's saying, you have, because Christ has saved you,

448
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,860
 because he's come into your life,

449
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,320
 you've tasted and seen that he is good.

450
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,260
 That word good in the Greek is the same word for beauty.

451
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,620
 You've tasted and seen the beauty of God.

452
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,540
 That beauty has encountered you.

453
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,320
 You were chaos, you've come into a greater place of order.

454
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,580
 That's been good for you.

455
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,940
 So now rid yourself of all of the stuff

456
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,020
 that's gonna take you back into chaos

457
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,420
 and crave this pure spiritual milk.

458
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,560
 Come to the Lord, ask for his spirit to continue to fill you,

459
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,260
 to change you, to rejuvenate you,

460
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,420
 because you have seen his beauty

461
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,220
 and you are becoming more and more the beauty of God.

462
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,520
 You tracking this?

463
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,580
 Okay, now notice what he says next.

464
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,060
 "As you come to him, the living stone," that's Jesus,

465
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,300
 "rejected by men, but chosen by God and precious to him,

466
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,360
 "you also, like living stones,

467
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,140
 "are being built up into a spiritual house

468
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,900
 "to be a holy priesthood,

469
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,940
 "offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God

470
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,220
 "through Jesus Christ."

471
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,420
 He's basically saying here,

472
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,260
 your salvation is not just for you personally on your own.

473
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,040
 As much as you have tasted and seen that the Lord is good,

474
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,700
 now come with other fellow believers and become the church.

475
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,660
 You are together, what Peter here says,

476
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,060
 is a holy priesthood.

477
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,500
 The priests in those days were the ones

478
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,260
 who facilitated the relationship

479
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,460
 for people to encounter God.

480
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,180
 Are you tracking the scripture?

481
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,740
 So Peter is saying, guess who are the people now

482
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,940
 who are gonna facilitate the encounter of people to God?

483
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,080
 The priests are now us, the church.

484
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,260
 This is Peter saying the church must be active in the world,

485
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,020
 saying that the church is the signpost

486
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,220
 to the glory of God.

487
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,900
 You who have encountered beauty are now to be together,

488
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,940
 building up a spiritual house

489
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,140
 that can be a royal priesthood

490
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,780
 so that anyone outside could see and know the glory of God.

491
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,140
 Peter's passionate about this.

492
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,480
 Let me jump down to verse nine.

493
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,460
 He carries on the thread of the conversation.

494
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,900
 He says, "But you, the church, are a chosen people,

495
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,740
 "a royal priesthood, a holy nation,

496
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,260
 "a people belonging to God,

497
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,820
 "that you may declare the praises of Him

498
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,100
 "who's called you out of darkness into His wonderful light."

499
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,340
 Do you see the theological thread of beauty here, right?

500
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,740
 Remember, beauty is order out of chaos.

501
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,620
 He says, "You guys have gone from darkness into light."

502
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,700
 That's the trajectory you've been on.

503
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,020
 It's an amazing thing.

504
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,580
 Now, don't waste what it is that God has done.

505
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,900
 Verse 10, "Once you were not a people,

506
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,840
 "but now you are a people of God.

507
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,480
 "Once you had not received mercy,

508
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,060
 "but now you have received that mercy.

509
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,600
 "So dear friends, I urge you,

510
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,900
 "as aliens and strangers in this world,"

511
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,620
 because now you're a part of this new creation

512
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,200
 in Christ Jesus, "to abstain from sinful desires

513
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,920
 "which will war against your soul

514
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,700
 "and just bring you back into more chaos."

515
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,120
 Verse 12, "Here's what you should do.

516
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,920
 "Live such good lives among the people around you

517
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,440
 "that though they accuse you of doing wrong,

518
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,240
 "they may see your good actions,

519
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,720
 "your good works, your good deeds,

520
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,720
 "and glorify God on the day that He returns to us."

521
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,140
 This blows my mind, what Peter's saying here.

522
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,140
 I need you just to sit with this for a moment, okay?

523
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,080
 Turn on those brains for a second, okay?

524
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,020
 This will blow your mind.

525
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,780
 Here's what Peter's saying.

526
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,300
 He's saying that there is a moment,

527
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,620
 there is a time when Jesus is going to come back.

528
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,220
 In the first century when they were writing,

529
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,420
 they thought that would happen at any moment.

530
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,660
 He's like, Jesus is going to come back.

531
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,180
 And when He comes back, everybody in the world,

532
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,300
 whether they're Christian or not,

533
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,300
 will know, taste, and see the glory and the goodness of God.

534
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,680
 That's going to happen.

535
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,080
 And he's saying, "Live such good lives today

536
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,780
 "that when Jesus comes back

537
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,540
 "and the people encounter the glory of God,

538
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,240
 "they connect the goodness and the glory of God

539
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,200
 "to what you had been doing back in that time.

540
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,960
 "And when they make that connection, they will praise God."

541
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,400
 In other words, their praising of God will come

542
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,060
 because they'll connect the glory

543
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,840
 that they'll know of Jesus in that moment

544
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,960
 to the glory that they tasted when you were around them.

545
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,520
 When you didn't slander them, you weren't malice.

546
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,320
 When you walked in the opposite spirit,

547
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,240
 where you've had hope

548
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,880
 when everybody else seemed to be depressed,

549
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,200
 where you were a flower at a funeral,

550
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,080
 when you were trying to live

551
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,500
 with a different spirit in the world.

552
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,640
 In all of those moments, they may slander you now,

553
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,900
 but when Jesus comes back, they will go,

554
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,220
 "Jesus was always with us."

555
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,580
 They're making sense?

556
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,200
 Jesus was always with us.

557
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,640
 They'll connect the glory then to the glory now,

558
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,660
 and that will cause them to worship God.

559
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,340
 That's an amazing statement.

560
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,380
 Peter's saying, "Understand how important it is

561
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:43,140
 "to be these displays of the beauty of God."

562
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,020
 The word, interestingly, that Peter chooses here

563
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,900
 for good in verse 12 is the exact same word

564
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,780
 that Plato would use so often to speak about beauty.

565
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,220
 Peter's writing about 300 years

566
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,720
 after Plato wrote "The Republic,"

567
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,620
 and he's writing into a Greco-Roman culture and context

568
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,540
 where they understood that it was shaped

569
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,260
 by much of what Plato, Aristotle,

570
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,540
 and the other philosophers had created.

571
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,620
 And they would have recognized that this word

572
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,940
 that Peter is using here connects to the very same thing

573
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,180
 that Plato was speaking about,

574
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,380
 the idea and the concept of beauty.

575
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,100
 And Peter is saying, "Live such beautiful lives,

576
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,100
 "lives that are dedicated to walking out of chaos

577
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,240
 "into order, live such beautiful lives

578
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,120
 "that when people see the glory of God,

579
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,740
 "they'll connect it to the beauty that had been there,

580
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,620
 "and they will praise Him."

581
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,700
 It's a challenge by God to walk in beauty.

582
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,700
 And we get to do this in big and small ways

583
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,940
 in all aspects of our lives.

584
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,060
 Let me share a quick story with you.

585
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,340
 Last, about a month ago,

586
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,620
 I finished my message here at the Vine.

587
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,140
 I think it was the 11 o'clock service,

588
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,900
 and I finished my message.

589
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,100
 And as I normally do, you might notice sometimes

590
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,500
 I walk out of the service before the service finishes.

591
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,820
 Don't worry, I'm not going away to lunch early.

592
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,820
 I normally go and stand at some point,

593
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,580
 whether in the upper house or here in the lower house,

594
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,780
 and say goodbye to you all as you leave.

595
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,880
 I was about to do that.

596
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,340
 I went out here, out the back,

597
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,540
 and I was gonna come around to stand over here

598
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,000
 to say goodbye to you guys.

599
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,140
 As I was out in the lobby,

600
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,460
 as the final worship song was playing in here,

601
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
 and you guys were all worshiping,

602
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,860
 somebody from our staff came up to me and said,

603
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,460
 "There's a gentleman crying in the staircase."

604
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,660
 And so I go into the staircase,

605
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,180
 and sure enough, there's a young boy.

606
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,620
 He's probably like 24, 25 years old.

607
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,380
 Young Chinese, local kid.

608
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,920
 And he's crying his eyes out.

609
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,820
 And I sit down and I introduce myself.

610
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,520
 "Hey, I'm Andrew, one of the pastors here.

611
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,100
 "Can I help you?"

612
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,140
 He can barely talk.

613
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,060
 He can't explain what's happening.

614
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,220
 He's just weeping and weeping.

615
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,060
 And I'm sitting there with him.

616
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,700
 And then, of course, the service finishes,

617
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,100
 and some 200 and something people

618
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,420
 are now rushing past us to get out.

619
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,660
 And he's still crying, and it's a little bit awkward,

620
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,740
 and he needs some privacy.

621
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,980
 So I help him, and we go into the little quiet room

622
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,620
 that's just in the back here.

623
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,460
 And I sit down with him.

624
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,420
 And for half an hour, I just try to draw out his story.

625
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,340
 And slowly, he begins to unpack the reality

626
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,460
 that he's a drug addict.

627
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,120
 And he's been a drug addict for somewhat

628
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,420
 about two to two and a half years.

629
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,840
 And he can't break his addiction.

630
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,720
 And it's really been difficult, of course,

631
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,740
 for him and his family.

632
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,560
 And he's trying to get sober.

633
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,200
 So by the time that I met him, he was a week sober,

634
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,560
 about six days into sobriety, not having taken drugs.

635
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,960
 And his whole body was screaming for the drugs, right?

636
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,400
 And so there was this complete internal turmoil,

637
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,800
 chaos happening for him.

638
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,000
 And he's not a Christian,

639
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,220
 and he just thought a church might be able to help him.

640
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,620
 He was so desperate that he literally showed up at the Vine,

641
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,460
 didn't come into the service,

642
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,580
 just out there in the corridor.

643
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,820
 And so I had the opportunity to share the gospel with him.

644
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,500
 Simple, nothing too fancy.

645
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,020
 Just this is why we're here.

646
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,020
 I can't change you.

647
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,300
 A church isn't gonna change you,

648
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,980
 but Jesus might be able to help you, can help you.

649
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,940
 Power of God to love and forgive you.

650
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,480
 And I start telling him about the gospel,

651
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,780
 and he seems to calm down a little bit.

652
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,620
 I said, "Are you hungry?"

653
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,440
 'Cause I'm hungry.

654
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,340
 He's like, "Yeah, I'm starving."

655
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,260
 So we went for Japanese food for lunch.

656
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,100
 Treated him to Japanese, it was awesome.

657
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,420
 He had like a crazy fish, and he skinned the fish.

658
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,260
 It was awesome.

659
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,580
 And during the lunch, I was praying in tongues in my head,

660
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,140
 thinking to myself, like, "How can I help this guy?

661
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,940
 "How can I help this guy?"

662
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,860
 And I remembered that I've got some good friends

663
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,620
 in ministries here that help drug addicts.

664
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,940
 And so I called up one of my friends,

665
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,260
 and I said, "Hey, I've got this guy,

666
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,220
 "and he seems to really wanna get off drugs,

667
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,380
 "but I'm not sure if we can help him.

668
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,540
 "I think you guys might be able to."

669
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,800
 And I was able to connect him to that ministry,

670
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,340
 and about four days later,

671
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,740
 he was accepted to go into that ministry.

672
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,860
 And he sent me a WhatsApp last week,

673
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,660
 and he said, "It's been really hard,

674
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,640
 "but I'm going into the ministry.

675
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,680
 "I'm committing to the ministry,

676
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,940
 "and I just wanna say thank you for the hope

677
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,860
 "that I have now."

678
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,620
 Now, I didn't really do much at all,

679
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,540
 other than take the time to listen to him,

680
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,460
 buy him some lunch, get him connected to someone.

681
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,680
 I'm not the guy that's gonna see him come free.

682
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,740
 That's the work of the Holy Spirit in his life.

683
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,840
 But I felt like I was partaking somewhat,

684
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,980
 taking grain and grapes and creating some bread and wine,

685
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,920
 participating with this young man's life

686
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,560
 so that he might experience something different

687
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,880
 in the world, that there might be some more beauty for him.

688
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,700
 And guess what?

689
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,600
 In that process, I felt like there was a little bit

690
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,160
 more beauty for me.

691
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,080
 How about for you?

692
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,420
 Let me challenge you with this.

693
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,440
 How might it be that you could usher

694
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
 in some beauty in this time?

695
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,340
 Where could you be bringing more order

696
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,760
 where there is chaos around you?

697
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,900
 What is it that you could usher in?

698
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,880
 Because that's what you've been created for.

699
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,480
 That's who you are,

700
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,920
 somebody who gets to display the glory of God.

701
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:56,900
 And so I wanna encourage some people in this room.

702
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,760
 If you're a parent in this room,

703
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,480
 particularly if you're a single parent in this room

704
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,760
 who's struggling to raise a child,

705
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,360
 I wanna encourage you that every time you pause

706
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,040
 and take a moment, even in the hardness

707
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,760
 of raising that child, to speak life into them,

708
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,560
 to shape them, to bring some character into them,

709
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,040
 just to see them grow that next step,

710
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,260
 you are ushering in beauty.

711
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,680
 Or let me speak to our domestic workers in this room

712
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
 who so often you're working so hard

713
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,080
 and you don't seem to get appreciation at all.

714
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,820
 You're dedicating yourself to bring order

715
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,360
 in the chaos of the family's home that you are living in.

716
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,760
 And the hours that you put in

717
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,200
 where you never get any thanks for them.

718
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,400
 God sees you and you are beautiful.

719
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,000
 Or if you're a counselor, coach, social worker,

720
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,120
 doctor, nurse, somebody in this room

721
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,840
 that's in the care industry, working on the front lines,

722
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,920
 meeting people daily who are broken

723
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,200
 and hoping that they will become whole again,

724
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,920
 and you're doing your skills and giving your life

725
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,240
 to be able to bring somebody along

726
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,320
 in a healing journey in some way,

727
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,000
 God sees you and you're beautiful.

728
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,920
 If you're a lawyer in here

729
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,000
 hoping to make more justice in our city,

730
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,960
 if you're a teacher here hoping to shape a young life,

731
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,780
 if you're working for the government here,

732
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,960
 hoping to bring some more structure to this place,

733
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,080
 if you're a police officer wanting to walk in integrity

734
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,720
 in the community that you're in,

735
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,800
 if you're a student wanting to study as well as you can,

736
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,480
 if you're a creative hoping to create something

737
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,760
 with your gifts and your skills

738
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,840
 that can say something about beauty in this world,

739
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,860
 if you're searching for employment right now,

740
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,120
 but you have this longing on your heart

741
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,040
 to contribute something to make this world a better place,

742
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,160
 all of you are beautiful.

743
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,360
 And you're being called by God to lean into acts of beauty

744
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,360
 that can truly change the world.

745
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,520
 Can beauty change the world?

746
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,720
 I look around this room, I look at you,

747
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,040
 and I am confident to say yes.

748
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,940
 With what you can bring, with what is in your hand,

749
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,660
 participating in the work of the Holy Spirit,

750
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,740
 beauty can be seen.

751
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,980
 One of the ways that we see beauty so often here at The Vine

752
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,880
 is through one of our ministries called Branches of Hope.

753
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,060
 You may have heard of Branches of Hope,

754
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,060
 it's the work that we do with asylum seekers and refugees,

755
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,620
 as well as the work that we do in anti-trafficking.

756
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,180
 And one of those ministries is stop,

757
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,940
 stop trafficking of persons.

758
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,940
 And when I was writing this message,

759
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,740
 thinking about acts of beauty and the ways

760
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,980
 in which we actually funnel and bring beauty into the world,

761
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,700
 meeting people in darkness, bringing them into the light,

762
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,980
 I thought of the work of Stop,

763
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,460
 because they do this day in, day out,

764
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,060
 but we don't often get to talk about it

765
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,940
 too much on a Sunday.

766
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,800
 And so I thought one of the great ways

767
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,340
 to finish this message would just be

768
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,180
 to have a short little conversation

769
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,380
 with the program director of Stop.

770
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,220
 Her name is Michelle Wong, she's with us today.

771
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,180
 Could you put your hands together

772
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,500
 as we invite Michelle to be here?

773
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,180
 (audience applauding)

774
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,220
 How are you?

775
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,060
 - Good, good, thanks.

776
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,220
 - I like your pink, I got pink today too.

777
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,760
 - Oh yeah, because it's the branding color of Stop.

778
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,620
 - I thought about that when I woke up this morning.

779
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,660
 I even have a pink clipboard here.

780
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,140
 - Oh wow, nice. - Yes, yes, yes, I know.

781
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,380
 All right, so we've been talking a lot in this series

782
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,700
 about darkness, about chaos,

783
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,860
 and about the reality of that in the world.

784
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,120
 And I know the work that you guys do in Stop,

785
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,880
 unfortunately means that you're entrenched

786
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,500
 in a lot of darkness as you're working with people

787
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,140
 that are caught in slavery.

788
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,060
 Could you tell us a little bit

789
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,600
 about that experience for you?

790
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,020
 - Sure, so thank you Andrew for thinking of Stop

791
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,180
 and also the community of trafficking person.

792
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,620
 And it is a privilege for me to speak here

793
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,960
 on behalf of the community as well.

794
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,320
 So ever since I start to get in touch

795
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,280
 with survivors of human trafficking,

796
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,780
 I am shocked that how dark the world can be.

797
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,260
 So human trafficking is a crime.

798
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,260
 So it's by using the means like deception, coercion,

799
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,460
 the threat of violation and also abuse of power,

800
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,260
 the trafficker has a control over another person

801
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,540
 for the sake of exploitation.

802
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,300
 So usually trafficker, they would offer false hope

803
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,420
 so that the people think that they can get

804
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,420
 into a great opportunity for a better future.

805
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,060
 The trafficker use hope and trust as the bait

806
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,820
 to manipulate the vulnerable people

807
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,140
 to fall for their tricks

808
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,420
 and become the victim of trafficking.

809
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,500
 So take one of our clients as example.

810
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,940
 So one of our clients was betrayed by her friends.

811
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,940
 Her so-called friends say that they will arrange

812
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,780
 a job opportunity for her in Hong Kong

813
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,020
 and then our clients paid 20,000 Hong Kong dollars

814
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,700
 to come to Hong Kong just to find out

815
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,580
 that the employment contract was fake.

816
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,580
 And the employer stated in the contract didn't exist.

817
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,900
 And then end up she spent two years staying in Hong Kong

818
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,580
 with no pay, no place to stay,

819
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,580
 fighting for a lawsuit and unable to support their families.

820
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,580
 So usually trafficking victims,

821
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:34,960
 they are trapped by forced labor, sex trade,

822
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,340
 the freedom of movement is restricted.

823
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,600
 And also they are suffering

824
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,320
 from excessive long working hours or debt bondage.

825
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,040
 Yeah, so, but above all,

826
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,040
 no darkness can compare with losing hope in their life

827
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,160
 and also losing trust in people.

828
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,120
 - I think when we think about our world,

829
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,520
 which can be a very dark place,

830
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,560
 and like I say, you guys are experiencing that darkness

831
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,360
 at levels that many of us probably don't.

832
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,460
 But for each one of us,

833
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,960
 when we see that darkness, it can be overwhelming.

834
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,920
 And that often our response to being overwhelmed

835
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,760
 is that we shut down, we kind of avoid,

836
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,120
 or we run away or we don't actually walk in and offer hope.

837
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,240
 We wanna kind of just avoid it

838
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,200
 or pretend it's not even there.

839
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,120
 What are some ways that you guys have learned

840
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,000
 to kind of handle the darkness,

841
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,080
 or at least to kind of not walk away,

842
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,320
 but actually walk towards it?

843
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,260
 - Yes, human beings, so we empathize.

844
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,260
 So we built to show compassion to each other.

845
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:46,100
 And we feel bad when we see someone is suffering, right?

846
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:52,320
 For instance, I remember one of our friends,

847
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,140
 we come across this case few years ago.

848
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,260
 She was a drug mill.

849
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,880
 So she was framed by a stranger in the airport.

850
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,460
 And someone put drugs in her suitcase.

851
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,220
 And right now she is halfway through

852
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,620
 her 10 plus year sentences in Hong Kong.

853
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:18,220
 So stop team, we write letter to her regularly,

854
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,380
 and just to show her that someone out there

855
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,540
 is still supporting her and care about her.

856
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,580
 But in this kind of situation,

857
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,100
 there's not much we can do.

858
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,380
 So I think that sometimes when we see

859
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,380
 this kind of suffering, this is larger than us,

860
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,940
 seems like we feel quite helpless with that.

861
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:48,180
 So people try to avoid this kind of problem.

862
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,180
 So to pretend that there's nothing bad

863
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,380
 happening in the world.

864
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,380
 So there's a term called vicarious traumatization.

865
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,500
 So usually it means that when we are indirectly exposed

866
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,300
 to this kind of bad things, chaos in the world,

867
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,180
 even us as an outsider, we will feel traumatized.

868
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,340
 So I think that's why people want to live

869
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,260
 in their own little bubbles.

870
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,780
 But that doesn't mean it would go away by itself.

871
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,220
 So yeah.

872
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,540
 - So for me, in the past years,

873
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,260
 for working with marginalized people,

874
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:39,140
 I often feel inspired by the strength of the survivors.

875
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,220
 The more time I spend with them,

876
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:47,300
 the more admire from me to them

877
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,900
 about their strength and resilience.

878
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,060
 So later on, I come across a term

879
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,780
 called vicarious resilience.

880
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,780
 It means that positive transformation and empowerment

881
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,780
 just by witnessing the survivors

882
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,340
 being able to fight and strive.

883
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:12,140
 So here I want to quote

884
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:19,980
 2 Corinthians 1.

885
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,980
 "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

886
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:31,980
 the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,

887
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,300
 who comfort us in all our troubles

888
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,300
 so that we can comfort those in any troubles

889
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,260
 with the comfort we ourself receive from God."

890
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,780
 So as us, we are very blessed being here.

891
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,900
 And we, as a chosen one, I encourage you all

892
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,220
 to be the light for someone in the darkness.

893
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,220
 - Yeah, that's great.

894
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,380
 What are some ways that, I think on Friday,

895
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,740
 we just celebrated the global day

896
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,340
 of kind of standing against those that are trafficking.

897
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,380
 So that was a really important day

898
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,540
 for you and the work that you do.

899
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,220
 But what are some ways that we can practically,

900
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,540
 as a church, continue to walk with stop,

901
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,500
 maybe support the work,

902
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,380
 or even use our sphere of influence

903
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,220
 to raise awareness, to shed that light

904
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,660
 in a pretty dark thing?

905
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,860
 - Yeah, so last Friday was World Day

906
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,980
 against trafficking in person.

907
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,900
 So we had a little gathering with our clients,

908
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,580
 and our volunteer cooks meals with the clients,

909
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,060
 and we shared food, and then we play a little games.

910
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,900
 So we had a great time with lots of laughter.

911
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,700
 Yeah, so I think for the church here,

912
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:48,700
 we are all here to support the vulnerable

913
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,660
 and marginalized people.

914
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,660
 So I have few things that I want to ask you to do right now.

915
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,860
 Can you all look at your phone out?

916
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:04,860
 And then, yeah, so can you see there's a QR code here?

917
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,500
 So the first thing I encourage you all to do

918
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,540
 is to educate yourself,

919
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,180
 to know more about human trafficking issue

920
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,220
 by following us on Facebook and Instagram.

921
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,100
 Sometimes our team would jokes about

922
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,100
 we are being like an influencer.

923
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,500
 So I think everyone is an advocate here.

924
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,220
 So just by learning about human trafficking issue,

925
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,380
 we can avoid contributing to the chain of modern slavery.

926
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,380
 So if you feel resonated, you can share our post

927
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,620
 to let your friends know about modern slavery,

928
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,060
 the human trafficking,

929
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,060
 this kind of chaos that's happening in the world.

930
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,100
 It can help to change the world a little bit by little bit.

931
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,380
 That's great.

932
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,380
 And there's an info session coming up as well.

933
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,420
 Yes, yes.

934
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,140
 So last week we have this little postcard

935
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,420
 putting on the seats,

936
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,940
 but this time if you want to get it,

937
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,100
 you can find our booth outside of the auditorium.

938
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,460
 And this is a card that we made for World Day Against Trafficking.

939
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,820
 It said, "Illuminating another's path always brightens yours."

940
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,420
 So we got like six ways that you can join us

941
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,100
 to combat human trafficking with us.

942
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,900
 And then on 15th of August,

943
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,100
 we have an info session for Stop in here in the Vine Church.

944
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,980
 So if you want to know more about Stop's work

945
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,620
 and also want to know more about the volunteer opportunities,

946
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,100
 you can scan the QR code here

947
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,420
 and then find more information and get to the sign-up link.

948
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,980
 So I hope to see you all on that day.

949
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,340
 Well, we really admire you, Michelle, and your team

950
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,580
 for the incredible work that you do,

951
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,340
 'cause it's not easy work.

952
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,780
 But I think if there's ever an example

953
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,300
 of what acts of beauty look like,

954
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,900
 helping people to go from that place of chaos to order,

955
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,020
 it's what you guys are doing.

956
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,860
 So we honor you.

957
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,460
 Can we put our hands together and just...

958
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,620
 Bless, Michelle, thank you so much.

959
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,020
 Can you guys stand with me?

960
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,980
 And I wanna pray for us.

961
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,380
 I wanna challenge and encourage you to consider

962
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,780
 what it is that you could do to bring more beauty

963
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,740
 into your sphere of influence,

964
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,420
 as you think about partnering in participation

965
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,300
 with the Holy Spirit in evangelism and mission

966
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,940
 and helping to see that order come

967
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,060
 from the chaos around us.

968
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,340
 So why don't we pray together?

969
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,700
 Let's pray.

970
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,700
 Father, we just thank you for each person in this room,

971
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,740
 each sphere of influence that they have

972
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,700
 and where you have planted them, Lord.

973
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,740
 As we heard in that Isaiah passage,

974
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,060
 they are a planting of the Lord, each person here.

975
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,060
 But they are also to be a display of your splendor,

976
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,860
 your glory, your goodness, your beauty.

977
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,420
 And Lord, we do that by reaching out

978
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,780
 in the various ways that we can,

979
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,940
 sharing your gospel,

980
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,540
 living such good lives as Peter challenges us

981
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,540
 before those in this world,

982
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:05,060
 that they can see a glimpse of what your beauty is,

983
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,020
 so that when you come into their lives,

984
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,860
 they will be able to connect those things together

985
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,540
 and praise you.

986
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,860
 And Lord, we thank you for the 21 people

987
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,900
 getting baptized today,

988
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,340
 who are a beautiful picture to us

989
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,740
 of what that beauty looks like.

990
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,220
 And Father, each one of us has our own testimony

991
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,340
 of the work that you've done in our lives in this area.

992
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,860
 So Lord, would you give us better insight and wisdom

993
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,940
 how we can begin to do this more and more

994
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,940
 in the world that is around us?

995
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,060
 Would your spirit,

996
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,860
 because we recognize it is a work of your spirit,

997
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,860
 would your spirit fall on us,

998
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,020
 so that we may participate,

999
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,460
 taking that grain and the grapes,

1000
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,020
 turning it into bread and into wine.

1001
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,180
 We thank you that you call us into that.

1002
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,660
 What a privilege it is to be your people,

1003
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,060
 your chosen people, your royal priesthood.

1004
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,460
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name,

1005
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,060
 everyone says, amen.

1006
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,620
 Why don't we respond together in a time of worship?

1007
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:07,620
