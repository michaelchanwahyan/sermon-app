[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   We thank you for this in Jesus name.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Everyone says, Amen.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.640]   Hey, can we thank our worship team?
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.640]   Thanks guys so much.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.840]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.280]   We're really full today. So I know there's a bunch of people looking for seats.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.920]   So if you've got a seat next to you, maybe you can just put your hand up in the air.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.240]   And we'll be able to get our host to, there's a seat right here at the front if someone wants to take that.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.720]   Yes, you. I can see it on your face. You're like, yes, I want to sit in the front.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.400]   I'm so excited for Pastor Andrew to spit on me whilst he's speaking.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.120]   That's so great.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.720]   Just got my splash warning in the front here.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.240]   Hey, we're so glad if you're joining the Vine for the first time, we're so glad that you're here with us.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.640]   My name is Andrew, one of the pastors here and
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.440]   it's such a joy.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.840]   I had the privilege of becoming senior pastor here on the 1st of November, 2013.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.120]   As you can imagine, it was the day of great excitement for me and my family.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.560]   I'm not sure if it was the day of great excitement for anyone else, but it was for me and my family.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.880]   And you know, I was 38 years old at the time and
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.080]   you can now find out how old I am, but don't do the math.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.440]   But I was 38 years old at the time and
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.360]   it was a day of joy, but it was a day where I was really unaware
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.760]   and in many ways, maybe not ready within myself for what I was stepping into.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.800]   I wonder if you've ever had an experience in your life where
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.600]   something's opened up for you,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.400]   you've got an opportunity and you work really hard for that opportunity and you kind of get into that opportunity and suddenly things maybe don't
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   turn out quite the way you thought it was going to turn out.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   And I remember that I had been so beautifully
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.640]   prepared for this leadership role here at the Vine by our two founding senior pastors, Tony and John.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.640]   Tony's in this room right now. He's gonna hate this, but I'm gonna point him out.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.520]   This is Tony Reed. Tony, could you put your hand up in the air so that everybody could honor Tony?
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.320]   And
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.360]   John will be watching online as he does so faithfully every week.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.480]   So John, we honor you too, but Tony and John, founding pastors here at the Vine.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.600]   They had prepared me over about a four to five year process privately,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.240]   just in terms of us as our leadership.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.120]   But then in terms of publicly about two years before the church. So there was a real clear
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.400]   process of transition from John and Tony to myself as the senior leader here.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.760]   And so I just honor the fact that they did such a great process.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.040]   But the reality was, I don't know if you've been married here,
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.520]   you know, like you might prepare yourself for marriage and then you get married and you realize that you have no idea what it is
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.920]   to be a husband or a wife. I was well prepared to be senior pastor,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.320]   but then as soon as I became one, I had no idea how to actually do it.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.520]   And in the first couple of months, I was overwhelmed by insecurity,
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.360]   by self doubts, by imposter syndrome.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   Anyone ever had imposter syndrome ever before?
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.080]   Feeling like I was unqualified
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.920]   and in many ways not worthy of being in the role that I was in.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.240]   And what was interesting for me is that this was kind of
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.320]   sort of catalyzed by a couple of actual physical things
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.040]   that were happening in our church in those first couple of months.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.840]   The first was that as I came in to be senior pastor here,
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.920]   the church had gone through a renovation project of this building a couple of years before then.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.040]   And we had obviously raised a lot of money to be able to do that.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.160]   But the reality was, as I stepped in to be the lead pastor, we were twenty five million dollars
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.440]   Hong Kong in debt.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.720]   And I knew on a on a kind of general level that that wasn't my personal debt.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.280]   I knew that that was just the reality of it.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   And it was something that I had been a part of in terms of creating that debt
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.400]   over the years of doing the transformation of this building.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   But again, as a 38 year old taking on that, that was a big responsibility
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.360]   I placed on my shoulders.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.480]   No one placed it on me other than myself.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.320]   I placed that pressure of, man, I'm going to have to perform
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.600]   really well in order for us to get rid of that debt.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.960]   So that was a weight on me in those first couple of months.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.320]   The other thing that happens and, you know, it's kind of rough when these things happen.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.200]   But oftentimes when there's a leadership transition,
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.160]   there's a shift not just in the transition of leadership, but also in the people themselves.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.720]   And so in the first two months of me leading here, 20 percent of the church left.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.000]   Twenty percent of the church left.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.040]   Now, I can look back on that today and with a bit more wisdom and maturity,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.400]   realize that that wasn't probably a personal thing directed at me.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   But in the moment, that felt very personal and very directed at me.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.720]   And I took that reality on my shoulders and the pressure began to build inside of me.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.440]   And the pressure was that John and Tony had done such a great job
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.920]   and had hand over to me.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.760]   And the worry and the concern I had was that in six months, in one year,
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.640]   in a year and a half, the vine will go from this great church
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.760]   that had been built by these two incredible legends to a church
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.920]   that was going to crumble and disappear under my leadership.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.000]   And again, I placed that stress and that burden on me.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.360]   Now, here's what I did over the first six or so months feeling that pressure.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.440]   I, of course, didn't tell anyone about it.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.200]   I just sat in the privacy of my anxiety.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.640]   I wonder if anyone's ever done that before.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.520]   Just sat in the reality of the brokenness, the privacy of my anguish,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.640]   my anxiety, the imposter syndrome.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.720]   And here was the thing.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.680]   I didn't want to tell anyone about it
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.560]   because I wanted everybody to think that everything was fine.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.680]   So I go online and watch sermons from back in that first year.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.760]   And here's Andrew up front preaching his heart out.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.800]   But I know that the Andrew inside was in great turmoil.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.320]   And by God's amazing grace, the church managed to still grow and thrive,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.400]   even though the pastor was dealing with some pretty dark thoughts
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.400]   inside of himself.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.480]   And this duality, the privacy of my anxiety
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.160]   and the public woohoo that I was on a Sunday
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.320]   was eating away at my soul.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.080]   And I remember about a year into leading here,
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.720]   I remember just this feeling it was like an air bubble
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.360]   was inside of me of stress and anxiety, and I felt like
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.920]   it was just building and building, the pressure was building and building
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.960]   and that I had to let it out.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.840]   I had to finally do something about it.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.520]   And I remember I got the courage to WhatsApp my wife, Christine.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.160]   I didn't have the courage to talk to her about it,
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.840]   but I had the courage to WhatsApp her.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.680]   And I WhatsApp her and I said, we need to go out for dinner tonight.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.120]   And she's like, what's up?
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.200]   And I'm like, I need to talk to you about something really serious.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.000]   Now, my wife thinks that I'm, I don't know, like going to talk about
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.920]   I'm not happy in our marriage or something like.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.280]   So Chris is like freaking out the whole day.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.120]   We get together for dinner.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.480]   We're living in Discovery Bay at the time.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.640]   We're in this very public restaurant, this big restaurant.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.760]   And we sit down and immediately I just start weeping
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.520]   in this big public restaurant and not just like a little tear
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.800]   rolling down my cheek, but I'm like snot bubbles,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.640]   you know, kind of weeping, like just weeping and weeping.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.480]   And Chris is just sitting there going like, oh, my goodness,
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.680]   I don't know what's happened, but this is serious.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.920]   And I said this to her, I said, I said, honey,
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.200]   I said, if I fail, if
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.680]   if the church continues to reduce in numbers,
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.960]   if I'm the worst pastor that there has ever been
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.480]   and if I don't do a good job, will you still love me?
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.400]   And that question betrayed the anxiety
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.520]   and the faulty thinking that was inside of me,
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.040]   because it was like in my mind, it was like performance earned love.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.800]   So if I failed, then she has the right to hate me like everybody else
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.080]   and think I'm a failure and leave.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.000]   But if I do well, you know, she should love me.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.040]   But if I fail, will you still love me?
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.880]   Now, of course, she reached over the table and she grabbed my hands
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.480]   and, you know, beautifully, of course, I love you, honey, I always love you.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.280]   You know, it was so awesome.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.400]   But she then said two things.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.800]   Two things that became one of those life transforming moments in your life.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.600]   Right. And she said these two things.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.960]   She said, first of all, you need to remind yourself
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.680]   that success in the kingdom of God is not based on achievement, but faithfulness.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.920]   And then number two.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   And this was weird to hear at the start, but I kind of followed with her.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.600]   She said, there are people better than you.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.360]   Thanks, hon.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.040]   Feel so much better now.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.600]   She said, there are people better than you.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.920]   There's going to be some pastor out there is a better person.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.360]   There's going to be some preacher out there is a better preacher.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.160]   There are people who are better than you,
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.120]   but no one else has been called to lead the vine than you.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:04.120]   Now, those two things I knew
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.640]   because those two things I had held in my spirit
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.160]   when I came into becoming senior pastor a year before.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.000]   But in the privacy of my anxiety,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.560]   in the isolation that I had created by not sharing with anyone
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.960]   as I had buried the reality of those two truths
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.040]   and allowed other thoughts to dominate in my mind.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.560]   It was only after I had decided to have the courage to pop the lid,
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.240]   to finally be honest about what was going on inside of me,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.520]   that my wife, the person that I love the most,
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.760]   the person that was my trusted confidant the most, was able to speak truth
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.320]   that was there, but deeply buried.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.600]   Truth that I had forgotten and had kind of isolated myself from.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.280]   She was able to bring those two truths out to me.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.240]   And this was a significant turning point in my life.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.040]   I am not making this up when I say to you that I think the primary reason
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.240]   why I'm still standing here today and leading this church
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.760]   is because of that moment in that restaurant.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.360]   Because those words shifted something inside of me.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   And if I had not had the courage
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.160]   to finally be honest about what was going on in here,
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.880]   I don't think I would have lasted.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.640]   And as she said, it's not about achievement, but faithfulness.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.120]   You're called and you have to hang on to that calling,
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.080]   even though you might see things going on.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.880]   You've got to hang on to that calling.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.960]   Those words brought life.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.720]   My most significant journey of personal transformation
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.200]   started that evening.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.680]   Now, it didn't happen all quick.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.920]   It wasn't suddenly like, oh, imposter syndrome gone, all that anxiety gone.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.320]   Twenty five million dollars debt gone, right?
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.760]   There was a journey, of course.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.760]   That journey was a long one.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.200]   I went into counseling and I needed counseling to deal with my anxiety.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.480]   I confess with some brothers and I Hudson's here,
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.160]   some really good brothers of mine who are accountable partners
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.800]   that I pray with regularly and confess with them.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.920]   And they stood and prayed for me as well.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.200]   It was a journey of Chris and I in our marriage, reconstituting
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.760]   what was going on there, because in that year I had isolated her
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.240]   from some of the deep things.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.280]   So there was a journey of healing, but it started
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.760]   because there was a significant pivot that took place
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.120]   when I went from a place of private anguish to public confession.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.120]   As we continue our journey and personal transformation
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.120]   in this theme that we're in over these weeks,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.160]   looking at the book of Ezra and particularly Ezra chapter three,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.360]   where where Israel's come out of their brokenness in Babylon,
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.200]   they've come back into a place of standing in that ruins
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.800]   and the rubble of the old temple that had been destroyed.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.600]   And in chapter three of Ezra, we see this beautiful picture
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.040]   of the builders coming out with the cornerstones and placing
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.960]   the first stones down for the rebuilding of the second temple.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.360]   In that story, we see seven words,
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.120]   seven words that I believe for some of you here today
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.600]   are going to be a pivotable transformation moment in your life.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.080]   Simple seven words that I think if you can understand the truth
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.200]   behind these words could be a little bit like what it was like for me
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.800]   to sit in that dinner and hear my wife speak truth into me.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.400]   Perhaps God's word wants to speak some truth into you today.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.440]   This series so far has been helpful for you.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.680]   If you've been thinking and reflecting over the last couple of weeks
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.240]   about the rubble within you, if you're praying and longing
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.760]   for that rubble to be renewed, my prayer is that these seven words
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.320]   would set your heart today alight.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.240]   Let me read this to you.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.360]   I'm going to jump back a few verses so that we can stay connected
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.280]   to the bigger picture of what we're looking at.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.040]   This is Ezra three, starting in verse eleven.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.560]   And all of the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.040]   because the foundations of the house of the Lord was laid.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   But many of the older priests and Levites and the family heads
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.920]   who had been who had seen the former temple wept aloud
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.120]   when they saw the foundations of this temple being laid.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.320]   While many others shouted for joy, no one could distinguish
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.520]   the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.360]   because the people made so much noise.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.800]   Here are the seven words.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.920]   And the sound was heard far away.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.080]   Let me say it again.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.360]   And the sound was heard far away.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.560]   Father, as we open up this just small segment of scripture here this morning,
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   I want to pray that you would do something significant for each of us.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.960]   And we thank you for this in Jesus name.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.120]   Everyone says, Amen.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.040]   Ezra describes this crazy moment.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.120]   We saw it last week.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.440]   The power that there was in a community worshiping and weeping side by side.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.920]   And we taught last week that that is the sound of restoration.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.440]   This invitation to be able to be honest with what's happening in our lives.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.360]   And and as you described, that sound is so loud.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.560]   It is so powerful that it mixes together so that no one can distinguish
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.360]   between the either.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.480]   It's like this harmony of sound is created where no one can tell
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.120]   the individual parts, but it's just this loud noise.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   And it's such a loud noise that in these final seven words of the verse,
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.680]   Ezra says, and the sound was heard far away.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.120]   Now, that might seem like a simple thing.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.320]   It might seem like a bit of a throwaway line.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.720]   Perhaps when we study scripture, we read things like this
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.760]   and we just kind of skip over it quite quickly.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.960]   But I think Ezra is wanting to root us into something that is significant
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.720]   in any journey of personal transformation.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.800]   Here's what he's saying.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:36.400]   He's saying, well, the transformation process for Israel was a personal concern.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.200]   It was not a private matter.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.920]   I want you to notice this, Ezra saying the sound of that weeping
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.480]   and worship went out far away.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.400]   There were people far from Jerusalem who could hear it, who could sense it,
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.200]   who were like, what's that noise, intrigued to discover and find out more.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:02.160]   And while the process of transformation from Israel was personal, deeply personal,
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.200]   it was not private, which should challenge all of us,
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.480]   because so often one of the reasons that we use to stay private
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.400]   about the stuff in our lives is because it's personal.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.560]   Come on, church.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.560]   It's like I'm not going to talk to anybody about this because it's super personal,
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.560]   like it's super personal and what's going on in my life and it's personal to me.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.480]   And so I'm going to remain private.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.320]   This was one of the most personal moments in Israel's history.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.920]   We saw last week that the reason why they're weeping is because God has shown
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.160]   them and reminded them about their brokenness,
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.040]   about some of the choices that they had made in the past
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.720]   and the consequences of those choices in their present.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.680]   And when they look at the rubble, they're connecting their personal choices
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.560]   in the past to the personal reality of what's happening there.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.280]   And it tears them up inside and they start weeping.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.120]   Because they realize what their choices have created in their lives.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.480]   Nothing more personal than that.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.480]   And then there's this other group who are praising and cheering and are so excited
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.920]   because they see that God's redemptive and restorative work is now at play.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.040]   And they're beginning to worship and they're beginning to sing praises.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.880]   And these two things are happening there because these two things are the reality
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.320]   of what's happening in that moment.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.520]   And as it goes, even though it's incredibly personal,
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.680]   they are not trying to sweep it under the rug and pretend like it hadn't happened.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.400]   They are exclaiming even the shame of what they have done,
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.480]   but they are not ashamed to proclaim that reality in their lives.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.800]   It was personal, but not private.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.920]   It was happening to them.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.760]   But there were others who could encounter it.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:53.080]   It was their experience, but it was not just their story.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.760]   It's fascinating.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.880]   Because as I've just shared personally out of my own life,
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.880]   I think that's all of our lives to a certain degree.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.960]   I think when there's stuff going on in us, there's rubble within us that we're aware of.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.520]   When we're going on a journey of healing, when we're still feeling sensitive
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.960]   from that brokenness, when the trauma is real, when the anxiety is being felt,
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.880]   when the fear is upon us, us, all of us, our natural temptation,
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.120]   our natural tendency is just to try to keep it from everybody else.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.120]   Just try to be private about it.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.480]   Try to bury it.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.240]   Try to just kind of push it away.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:37.000]   And at least on the surface, just try to make sure that everybody else thinks
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.160]   that we're perfectly fine.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.920]   We have this danger as humans to almost want to do that naturally.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.320]   Just take that pain, bury it as much as possible.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.280]   And as long as I come in on a Sunday, raise my hand, sing songs.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.760]   And if anybody asks me, how are you?
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.840]   I'm great.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.560]   When actually the reality is inside, I'm dying.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.560]   That there's something in here that I can't wrestle with, and I'm just trying
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.880]   to isolate myself from it, and it feels like I'm pulling away from everybody around me.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.680]   Now, don't hear me wrong.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:14.000]   I'm not advocating that you do the exact opposite of that at every moment of your life.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.000]   Trust me, it is not wise to put your whole life on display for absolutely everybody to see.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.280]   Like, "Oh, Pastor Andrew, he preached about taking things that are private
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.120]   and making them public.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.080]   Okay, well, then I need to tell everybody everything that I ever meet.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.760]   I'm going to put all my dirty laundry out for everybody to see."
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.000]   If you go to work tomorrow, come on, church.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.040]   If you go to work tomorrow and say, "Oh, I'm going to put Pastor Andrew's message
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.600]   into application in my life, and I'm finally going to tell my boss everything
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.960]   I really think about them."
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.320]   You will not have a job, okay, on Tuesday.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:46.960]   Are you with me?
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.360]   So we need to be wise, of course, about how we do this, about who we share with,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.560]   when we share, and how we share.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.400]   We don't swing the pendulum to the other way and go, "Everybody needs to know everything
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.720]   about me that has ever happened."
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.520]   That's not a healthy place to be.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.400]   But here's the thing.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.640]   As human beings, as Christians, we do the opposite thing, the opposite extreme more,
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.200]   which is rather than tell everybody about everything, we don't tell anybody
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.640]   about anything at all.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.840]   And we push it down, we suppress it, we bury it, and we come and we do our thing,
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.720]   but nobody actually knows what's truly going on inside.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.440]   And we kind of operate out of that place.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.640]   And here's why we do it.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.080]   And this is so ironic.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.640]   We do it because we think this, "If people truly knew what was inside of me,
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.840]   if they truly knew what I thought about things, if they truly knew the things
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.120]   that I've done, if they truly knew the pain that I'm wrestling with,
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.400]   if they truly understood my thought life, well, they wouldn't want to be my friend
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:45.760]   anymore.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.600]   They would turn away and they would isolate me.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.080]   They would distance themselves from me.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.360]   I would lose my community.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.720]   I would lose my spouse.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.360]   I would lose everything in my life."
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.360]   And so we're so afraid that if we are honest, people will isolate us.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.760]   Here's what we do ironically.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.920]   We choose to isolate ourselves.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.880]   Do you follow that?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.400]   So we think, "If I share, people are going to back away and isolate myself."
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.600]   So instead, we bury within ourselves.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.800]   We choose ourselves to isolate ourselves and on the surface, pretend like
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.720]   everything's fine.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.520]   And we end up living in a duality that is not sustainable.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:31.440]   A duality of private, brokenness, pain, anxiety, whatever, and public, "How are
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.120]   you doing?"
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:38.800]   And these two things wear down your soul over time.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.240]   Listen to this.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:49.080]   When your external behavior operates intention to your internal reality, you
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.680]   will always end up having more rubble and less transformation in your life.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.080]   Come on, church.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:02.640]   When your external behavior operates intention to what is actually true inside
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.160]   of you, everything's great.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.120]   No, it's absolutely not.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.200]   And that lasts over an extended period of time.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.240]   Here's what will happen.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.320]   You will basically deteriorate in your mental, in your emotional, and in your
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.000]   spiritual health, which will also have an impact on your physical health because
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.600]   we're holistic beings.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:31.160]   Here's Israel, and they're going through some deep personal things, things that are
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.680]   making them weep as well as things that are making them praise.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.000]   And here's what happens.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.320]   Those that needed to weep, wept.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.800]   Those that needed to praise, praised.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.640]   In other words, Israel made a decision that they were going to ensure that their
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:53.320]   external behavior actually corresponded to their internal reality.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.640]   So those that were in pain, those that were grieving, those that were feeling bad
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.720]   for the sin that had happened, those that were dealing with the consequences of
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.800]   brokenness, they wept.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.240]   Those who could see the forgiveness of the Lord, who saw the start of a new
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.560]   season, who were excited that God was going to do something for them, they began
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.200]   to praise.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.320]   And both had space to be who they were.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.360]   Both, could be honest, they didn't need to bury.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.680]   They didn't need to be private.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.760]   They didn't need some duality of life.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:27.560]   The sound of restoration was made loud and clear, and it was beginning to change
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:27.880]   them.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.360]   And here's what their honesty created.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.160]   It created two things.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:43.080]   First of all, it created an environment by which they could have a personal
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.200]   community of comfort and healing.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:51.560]   And secondly, it created an environment in which they could have a public place of
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.640]   hope and restoration.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:59.560]   And any work of renewal in your life and in a community's life like this, if it's
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.640]   truly going to have effective impact, these two things have to be operating in
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.080]   that place at the same time.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.440]   A place of comfort and healing, a place of hope and restoration.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:17.600]   And the thing that makes those two things is that courage to take what is buried
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   within and with wisdom and being smart about it, offer it to those that we trust.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.400]   Let's start with the first one.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.520]   See, Israel understood that as they allowed the space for people to weep and
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.760]   for people to pray, everybody had a place.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.040]   And that because of that, they weren't burying anything inside of them.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   They were opening it up, letting it out, getting it up there.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.120]   They were surrounded by this group of people who would be able to come alongside
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.160]   of them and go, "Hey, I see that.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.000]   I feel that.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.240]   I've felt that too.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.600]   I've dealt with that too.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.120]   Hey, can I pray with you?
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.240]   Can I stand with you?
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.640]   Can I create space with you?"
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.600]   It's really interesting.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.680]   You've got to understand it this way.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.240]   When you come into relationship with Jesus, you don't just come into relationship
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.120]   with him, but also relationship with his people.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.680]   This is what church is all about.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.760]   When we are saved, we're not just saved into a new relationship with the Lord.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.160]   We're saved into a relationship with one another.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.720]   And God has created gatherings like this church experience in the ways in which we
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.440]   do it in multifaceted ways.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   He's created it and he said, "Look, I'm going to bless it with my spirit.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.280]   And although, yes, you can open the Bible, read a word and be encouraged.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.160]   Yes, you can come in, sing some songs and I'll speak to you by my spirit."
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.400]   Some of the most powerful, transformative moments that the spirit will do in your
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.720]   life, he will do through somebody else in your life.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:52.760]   And as we embrace the reality of what God has given us, when we have the courage to
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:59.520]   not isolate ourselves from the body of Christ, true change and transformation
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.280]   really takes place.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.960]   See, you are not saved into a private redemptive ticket to heaven.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:14.920]   You're saved into a public here family, redemptive family on earth.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:21.280]   And God, by his great spirit and his grace and the work of Jesus has adopted us into
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.720]   that family. And we now have millions of brothers and sisters all over the world.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.240]   Did you know that God has no grandchildren?
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.560]   Come on, church, work it out.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.840]   God has no grandchildren.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.920]   He has sons and daughters, his children in a family.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.000]   We're that family.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.720]   It's not a redemptive ticket out of here.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.760]   Some private, "Oh, my gosh, now I'm in a good relationship with Jesus.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.520]   I'm saved."
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:53.400]   Our salvation drives us towards one another in this beautiful, redemptive family
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.320]   where as brothers and sisters, we get to stand with each other and walk with each
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.240]   other in some of the hardest moments of life.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.320]   This is why Paul, when he's writing to the church in Romans 12, 15, he says it this
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.600]   way. He says, "Rejoice with those who rejoice.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.160]   Weep with those who weep."
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.160]   A beautiful invitation for the body of Christ to be the body of Christ to one
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.080]   another. Later in 1 Corinthians 12, 16, I think it is, he says this.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.960]   He says, "Look, if any member of the body is suffering, we're all suffering with
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.320]   them."
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.600]   In other words, don't you understand how integrated and connected we are that God
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.000]   has created the church to be a place where we rejoice with those who rejoice,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.560]   weep with those who weep, where when one suffers, we all suffer and we come
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.600]   together in healing and restoration and comfort and joy and love.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.680]   And when people can be honest and say, "You know what?
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.000]   This is a safe place for me to let out some of this stuff that I've been bearing
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.680]   and bearing."
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.080]   True transformation takes place.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.520]   Notice what it says, "Rejoice with those who are rejoicing.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.480]   Weep with those who are weeping."
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:01.280]   It does not say when somebody confesses something or opens their lives up that
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.720]   your job is to try to just cheer them up or that your job is to correct their
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.400]   theology.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:14.200]   It says your job is to meet them in their emotion and sit with them in it.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.560]   Rejoice if they're rejoicing.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.720]   Weep if they're weeping.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:26.080]   Find a place of connection and sit with them because they need, they've taken all
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.880]   this courage.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.400]   I mean, imagine if my wife had leant across the table and she said, "Just suck
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:30.720]   it up."
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:36.560]   Or if she'd leant across the table and said, "Let me just open up Luke chapter
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.240]   15."
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.640]   But we do that to one another.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.160]   That's part of the reason why sometimes we keep things buried and we don't
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:44.480]   share.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.280]   Because maybe we have shared in the past and somebody responded in a way that
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.080]   wasn't what we were thinking, wasn't what we were expecting, and it's hurt us
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:51.520]   even more.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.760]   And we buried and buried and buried.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.160]   We've all had those kind of experiences, but it doesn't stop Paul writing to the
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.600]   church, and it doesn't stop me standing here before you today and saying, "We have
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.840]   to push beyond those bad experiences."
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.960]   Just because somebody didn't respond how I thought doesn't mean the next time I do
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.840]   it, it's going to be the same.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.480]   No, I still have the pain.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.320]   I need someone to pray for me, stand with me, support me.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.200]   Jesus himself did this.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   The night in the Garden of Gethsemane, his greatest personal trial and challenge,
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.800]   knowing that the cross was just a few days away, he brings, notice this, he
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.600]   brings all the disciples with him to the Mount of Olives to pray.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:35.360]   But then, Matthew tells us, he takes his three best friends, James and John and
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.960]   Peter, and he takes them a little bit further and he says these words.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.440]   He says, "Stay with me.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.720]   Pray for me.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.320]   Pray and guard.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.840]   Pray against temptation.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.560]   I need you to stand with me."
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.920]   Because he's like, he's about to sweat blood.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.440]   He's in a place of deep personal anguish.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.760]   Jesus understood this was a personal journey, but not a private matter.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.440]   Come on, church.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:03.160]   And so he demonstrates to us, the Son of God, that he needed his best friends
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.480]   praying and standing with him, supporting and speaking life into him to get him
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.680]   through the darkness of that hour.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.520]   Now, the reality is they fell asleep.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.720]   That's a whole nother story.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.120]   That's a whole nother sermon.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.280]   We're not going to go there right now.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.400]   But do you see what he's demonstrating to the church?
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:26.600]   Some of you here are in the body of Christ, but you are remaining distant and
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.280]   private from the very people God has placed around you.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.040]   Jesus didn't do it.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.160]   Neither should you.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:37.120]   Here's the second thing.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:42.200]   The second thing is, as Israel begins to be honest about the reality in their
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.560]   lives, as they weep and they worship, as they have one another to bring that
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.280]   comfort in life, it's not just that healing and restoration that happens for
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:56.120]   them. Others are able to now hear and see and go, "Hang on a sec.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.760]   Something significant is happening over there and something's beginning to
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.320]   change. What is that?
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.400]   That's interesting."
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.480]   And they can be drawn.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.560]   We don't have time to look at it today.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.520]   But if you follow on with the rest of the story, the other nations begin to
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.320]   hear of the transformative work that's happening in Israel.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.640]   And some of them get scared and want to fight back like we'll see next week.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.200]   Others are drawn near and wanting to understand, "Is there really a God who
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.640]   can change and transform us?"
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:28.240]   The beautiful thing about a redemptive community who are willing to walk in
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.880]   their pain openly before trusted people in their lives is that it creates hope
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.920]   for those who are a long way off.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:42.120]   God changes you not just because he wants to change you.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.120]   He changes you because he longs to change your family member, your colleague,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.520]   the person that you're dating, the whatever it might be.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:59.120]   Our own transformation is always in God's hands for him to use as a demonstration.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:10.320]   Every work of private renewal has potential public power.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.800]   That's, again, what God does in a community like this.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:22.400]   He creates a church and he brings us together so that our sound would be heard
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.200]   far away.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:29.040]   So that when we testify about the transformation that the Lord has done in
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.800]   our lives, when we stand publicly and say, "There was anxiety and there was
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.400]   pain and I shared with someone and they prayed with me and I changed my tune and
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.080]   I began to see myself differently.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.840]   I began to see the world differently."
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.520]   This is the sound that people outside are desperate to hear.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.520]   The ones who are seeing the world's news and they're saying, "Is anything good
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.640]   ever going to come in this world?"
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.680]   The one who are seeing their stocks and their investments go down and are
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.920]   thinking, "Is there anything more to life than what I'm experiencing right now?"
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.080]   And if the church is making the sound of restoration and the only people that can
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:10.120]   hear it are the ones in this room right now, we are not church.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.840]   What's the point?
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.400]   Jesus didn't die on the cross for the church to be a holy huddle.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.600]   Didn't die on the cross so the church could be some thing on the hill far away
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.200]   from the world.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   He died on the cross so that the sound of restoration would be heard by those far
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.680]   away that the thing that the Lord has done in your life, no longer suppressed,
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.920]   but spoken out of and given hope, brought light into, could be the very thing that
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.280]   might bring them new life.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:43.600]   There is always transformative power in the public witness of a private renewal.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.320]   That's a summary of the book of Acts, if there ever has been one.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.120]   At the book of Acts, at the beginning, Jesus says, "You're going to go from here,
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.040]   filled with my spirit, so that you would be my what?
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.680]   My witnesses.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:02.000]   So that what I've done in you would be seen in the world, so that others might
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.240]   find hope in that reality."
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.200]   There is always transformative power in the public witness of a private renewal.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:19.680]   But any time we keep it all buried, we're diminishing the sound that was meant to
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.480]   be heard far away.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.840]   I want to read you just something that Paul says in 2 Corinthians, as he's trying
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.160]   to kind of picture this to his church.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.120]   He says these beautiful words in 2 Corinthians 1 verse 3.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.920]   He says, "Praise be to the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:41.840]   of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in our troubles so that
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.200]   we can comfort only ourselves in private in our services.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:55.680]   Who comforts us in our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.920]   the comfort that we ourselves have received from God."
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.160]   When we read a passage like that, we think Paul is actually speaking
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.160]   specifically about the church.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:07.280]   Of course, he's speaking into the church, but he's using language here where he's
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.800]   saying, "Don't you understand that in the church, when you experience that comfort
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:18.160]   and that renewal in your life, you are then able to comfort any trouble, any
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.600]   person who's got trouble."
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:24.120]   He's not saying just those in church who believe in Jesus and sing kumbaya with
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.280]   you on a Sunday.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.800]   He's saying anyone who has trouble, who is struggling, when Christ comforts you,
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.000]   there is a overflow of that comfort that is not just for those that believe in
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.600]   Jesus, but it's for those that are desperately in need of Jesus.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:46.760]   And that as we begin to operate in a place of public release to the private
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.200]   renewal, the church becomes the church.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:58.480]   One of my favorite stories in Jesus' ministry is this moment where Jesus is
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.160]   walking through the crowds and the crowds by this point, he's been ministering for
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.320]   some time and the crowds have grown and grown and grown.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.120]   And in fact, he's still in Galilee and he's still surrounded daily by these
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.640]   crowds and everybody's trying to get a piece of Jesus.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:15.360]   Everybody's trying to clamber onto him, press around him, try to get a hold of
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:21.520]   him. And in this story, a woman who had been bleeding for 12 years, the kind of
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.520]   bleeding that meant that she was ceremonial unclean all the time, meant
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.000]   that she was cast as an outcast in her community, the sort of bleeding that you
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.920]   would want to keep very, very private, not let anyone know about it, not talk
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.960]   about it with anyone.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:42.520]   This woman, she hears that Jesus has done miracles around Galilee and she's heard
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.800]   the stories that he might be the Messiah that the Jewish people have been longing
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:52.880]   for. And the Bible tells us that in faith, she decides this one can heal me.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.800]   I believe that he is the Messiah.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.640]   I believe he can set me free.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:04.920]   And in that faith and belief, she decides to press through the crowds so that she
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.920]   could just get a hold of Jesus.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.280]   Let me let me actually read this to you from Luke chapter eight.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.080]   And we're going to pick up the story.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.480]   Says this, "As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.760]   And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for 12 years, but no
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:27.520]   one could heal her. She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak and
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.440]   immediately her bleeding stopped.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.080]   "Who touched me?" Jesus asked.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.200]   When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are all crowding and
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.240]   pressing against you."
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.440]   Jesus said, "No, someone touched me.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.120]   I know because power has gone out from me."
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.560]   Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.360]   his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had been, why she
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.640]   had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.320]   And then he said to her in the public, in front of everybody, "Daughter, your faith
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.960]   has healed you. Go in peace."
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.920]   There's this moment where she has the audacity of courage to reach out.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.960]   And as he's walking by, just grasp the hem of his cloak.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.360]   And Jesus stops immediately.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.240]   And as she's doing this, as she grasped that cloak, she's immediately healed.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.680]   It's really important that you understand this.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.000]   She's immediately healed.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.200]   It's not like she's got to go through some journey of healing.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.560]   In this particular moment, she's instantly, immediately healed.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.400]   Jesus stops and says, "Who touched me?"
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.880]   To which Peter, in the blunt way that Peter always is, is, "Dude, everybody's
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.360]   touching you."
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.040]   Like, can't you see the whole crowd around you?
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.560]   Like, are you mad, Jesus?
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.240]   Like, everybody's pressing in on you.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.360]   Everybody's, what do you mean?
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:42.960]   Who's touching?
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.680]   We're all touching you, Peter said.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.560]   Jesus is like, "No, power has gone out from me.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.520]   Who's touched me?"
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.800]   Now, notice this.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:56.040]   He's doing this and he's placing this woman in a place of decision.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.000]   She does not need to come forward for further healing.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.880]   She's already received our holy.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.960]   She's instantly healed.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.720]   In other words, she's got what she's come for.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.960]   So she could go, "You know what?
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.360]   I'm just going to privately go back into my little hovel.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.520]   I'm going to retreat from this moment.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.120]   I don't need any more of Jesus.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.880]   He's done what he needs to do in me.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.600]   I could get away.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.880]   I'm just going to slip away."
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.160]   Jesus is like, "No, no, no.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.680]   You've received your healing, but there's something else now that I want you to do."
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:29.040]   And she realizes that she can't escape, so she comes forward and she begins to
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.720]   testify.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.480]   We don't have the words.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.040]   I wish we did.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.000]   But she begins to testify about what she believed Jesus was and the faith that she
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.240]   had and the touching of his cloak and how she had been instantly healed.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.440]   And you can imagine the other people standing around and they're going, "But I've
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.200]   been touching him and I haven't been healed."
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:50.280]   Now, this is why Jesus does what he does next.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:50.960]   This is so cool.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.440]   He calls her forward in front of everybody for two reasons.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.600]   One, her bleeding has ceremonially made her unclean in her community.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.840]   So by bringing her forward and her testifying to her healing, Jesus was
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.440]   restoring her back to her community.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.600]   You can go back to this community.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.920]   You can now grow with this community.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.800]   They can accept you again.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.680]   So this is a public restoration for her back to her community.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.240]   That's great.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.720]   But that's actually not the main thing I think Jesus is doing here.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.560]   There's this other thing.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.240]   He's now getting her to become the main preach point to the crowd.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:29.040]   Because the crowd is thinking, "We're touching Jesus and nothing's happened.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.000]   She's touched Jesus and she got her healing.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:32.760]   Why?"
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:38.240]   And Jesus says, "Go in peace because your faith has healed you."
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.840]   Jesus is basically saying, "There's a difference crowd between touching me
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.520]   without faith and touching me with faith."
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:51.000]   And he uses her testimony to be the thing that he really wanted to say.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.440]   It wasn't actually about her healing as amazing as that was for her.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:53.960]   That's great.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:59.040]   But it was this teaching point that her testimony was releasing.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.560]   Some of you in this room, your journey of personal transformation is going to be a
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.560]   testimony that the crowds around you need to hear.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:13.120]   That Jesus wants to say and do and operate in the people around you in ways that are
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:20.840]   going to be totally transformative in the future as you take the courage to testify
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.520]   what the Lord has done.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.600]   We have to be wise about it.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.320]   We don't go bashing people over the head with a Bible at every opportunity we have.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.920]   But as you trust the Lord, he will open up avenues for you to come forward and say,
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.520]   "This is what happened to me."
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:41.560]   Some of you in this room, your journey of personal transformation will only begin
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:49.160]   and the pivot will happen for you when you stop living the duality life of private
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.520]   anguish that no one knows about and public everything is fine.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.680]   Some of you this week, you're going to be taking a major step of courage, but a major
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.960]   step to the renewal that the Lord wants to do in your life by saying, "I am tired of
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.560]   living as two people."
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:07.520]   You need wisdom as to who to share with.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:12.120]   You need to work out what the Lord wants you to do and how to do it.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.320]   But there is someone in your life that the Lord will bring to your mind if you pray
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.680]   that prayer honestly, that you should open up to this week.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.520]   And in doing that, you are exposing what the enemy has kept in darkness and you're
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:32.400]   allowing light, the light of Christ to flood into it.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:38.280]   As we confess our sin, as we confess our brokenness, as we even confess just the hurt
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.200]   and the pain, God heals us through one another.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:48.760]   So some of you this week, that's the pivot point for you to stop saying, "I don't want
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.880]   to live like this anymore."
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.560]   I'm going to have the courage to say, "I need help.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.160]   Would you pray for me?
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.840]   Can you understand this?"
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:03.200]   And I want to encourage you that if you're the person that person turns to, rejoice with
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.520]   those who rejoice and weep with those who weep.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.640]   Just be with them.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.520]   Be with them, pray for them, stand with them, love them.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.720]   And some of you here, you've got a testimony to say.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.120]   You've got a proclamation of praise.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.520]   You've gone through a private renewal and now is a chance that God might be explaining
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:28.160]   and putting before you for some public proclamation of what's privately happened
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:28.720]   within you.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:35.480]   Look and pray for the opportunities and we will see many people respond to the sound
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.240]   of restoration.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.320]   Amen?
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.800]   Helpful?
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.640]   All right, let's pray.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:47.440]   Father, I just thank you so much for each person here this morning in this journey of
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.480]   Ezra and transformation that we're on here at the Vine.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:43:02.640]   And as you just quieten your hearts and as you bow your heads, perhaps for some of you,
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.760]   you know that there is immediately an area of your life that you've kept very private.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:14.800]   As I've explained in the message, we do that for many reasons, fear, the sense that if
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.520]   somebody would know, they would reject us.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:22.040]   Perhaps just the shame of what it is that we're carrying and we buried it deeply.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.320]   And we thought we could get away with it.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.080]   We thought we could live a double life.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:30.040]   We thought that that would be fine, but we know it's wearing on our soul.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:35.240]   We know that our mental, emotional, spiritual life is deteriorating.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:43.360]   And just like me a year into being senior pastor, there's this bubble coming up out
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.560]   of you and you're like, I can't hold this anymore.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.560]   I'm so tired of it.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.680]   So tired of living a double life.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:56.520]   I want to pray that if that's you here this morning, whether online, in this room, in
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:02.360]   the overflow, I want to pray now that the Holy Spirit would show you the person for
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.160]   you to share with.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:07.120]   And I pray that he would give you the courage to do it this week.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:15.120]   And I want to pray the blood of Jesus over every conversation, over every exposing of
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.360]   the darkness, because the enemy will not like it.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.600]   And as you leave here today, you might be feeling in this moment, yeah, I want to do
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:21.720]   it.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.920]   And then you'll leave here in a moment and you'll suddenly feel like, oh, gosh, that
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.960]   was just a thing in the moment.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.760]   Don't allow the enemy to cause you to retreat again.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:36.240]   If you're feeling like this is your time to be open in the week or the couple of weeks
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.600]   ahead, don't let the enemy whisper back into you to retreat you again.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:45.000]   I pray, Lord, for the blood of Jesus and protection over every person here who wants
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.160]   to have one of those kinds of conversations in the week ahead.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:54.320]   And Lord, we pray for the fruits of the love and the light and the forgiveness and the
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.200]   grace of Jesus over anything that has been kept in darkness.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.440]   And we pray this now in Jesus name.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.240]   Lord, I pray a releasing over your people.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:08.320]   And Lord, for those people that you're raising a testimony in.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.680]   Lord, I want to pray that they would see the avenues and the people that they can
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.360]   share with.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.320]   Lord, we pray that those who are currently in our city, who are far off.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.720]   Lord, we pray that they would hear the sound of restoration in your church.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.840]   Lord, we pray that in our spheres of influence, in our families and the people around
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:30.320]   us, Lord, that as we begin to proclaim the goodness of a God who has set us free, that
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.480]   we would see others say, I want to learn more about that.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.160]   Why do you have so much peace?
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.040]   Why do you have so much joy?
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.400]   And that they would go take me, bring me, share with me, help me.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.520]   Let's go out for coffee.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.800]   Let's talk about this more.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:50.120]   Lord, I pray that you would release this church into the city with the hope of the
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:54.600]   gospel and the redemptive power that there is in our testimony.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.160]   Lord, thank you for what you've done in private renewal.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:03.680]   And we pray for the transformative power that happens in public witness.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.960]   Lord, we pray this in Jesus name.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.600]   Everyone says, would you stand with me as a community?
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:16.520]   And let's just join in a place of worship before the Lord as we thank him for what
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.400]   he's doing in our lives.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.960]   [MUSIC]
