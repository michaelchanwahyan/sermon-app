[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   I want to share a word or a picture that we received in the first service.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.740]   So as your hands are open before the Lord, it's a posture of just being ready to receive
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.820]   what it is that he has on his heart for you here on the first Sunday of 2025.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.020]   We believe no one's in this room, no one's in the overflow, no one's watching online
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.540]   by mistake in this moment.
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.100]   Wherever you are, whatever's going on, the Lord knew you would be here in this moment.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.140]   And he has something to say to you, whether just in the worship time, whether in the message,
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.220]   whether in our prayer ministry time, but he's excited that you're here.
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.660]   Whether you feel a long way away from him or whether you are rejoicing in your relationship
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.820]   with him.
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.140]   In the first service, we saw a picture, somebody from the congregation had a picture of a little
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.660]   bamboo seed being planted in soil to grow a bamboo tree, a bamboo plant.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.380]   And they planted this seed, but they didn't realize that bamboo plants take a long time
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.380]   to actually bud.
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:12.660]   Apparently it takes about seven years for a bamboo seed to finally come up above the
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.660]   soil.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.540]   And what it's doing in those seven years is spreading its roots out.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.380]   It's putting its roots far and wide just by the surface of the soil so that whenever the
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.140]   rain comes, it can easily receive.
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.900]   And it's not until about seven years that the first of the buds of the bamboo stalk
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.580]   appear on the surface of the ground.
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.220]   And we felt that as the Lord gave us this picture, that for some of us, it feels like
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.860]   it's been a long time, perhaps a long time of dryness, perhaps a long time before you've
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.780]   seen any fruit.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.660]   Perhaps you've been praying, perhaps you've been working, perhaps you've been expecting,
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.060]   you've been faithful.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.940]   But what you planted in faith a long time ago seems to have not come to fruition.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.220]   And the Holy Spirit would say to you today that sometimes things take a little bit longer
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.980]   than you expect.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.900]   Sometimes things have to go deeper.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.380]   Sometimes roots have to be placed.
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.060]   So that when the future happens and when the winds blow and the weather comes, that you
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.140]   have that solid ground.
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.900]   Jesus shared something similar in a parable once, didn't he?
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.540]   He said, "Those who hear my word and obey it, they're ones who put their feet on solid
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.620]   rock, not on shifting sand."
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.540]   Some of you who feel like the Lord is a long way away, he's been at work putting roots
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.220]   into you.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.180]   Some of you who have been wondering why there hasn't been some fruit, I believe that you're
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.180]   about to step into a season of great fruit.
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.860]   And sometimes we don't see the things that the Holy Spirit sees.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.700]   Sometimes no matter how faithful, how much prayer, how much hope, sometimes we do not
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.020]   see the things that God sees.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.500]   And I want to just pray over you at the first Sunday of 2025 that the eyes of your heart
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.460]   would be enlightened as Paul prays to the church in Ephesus.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.180]   That the eyes of your heart would become enlightened, that you would see the things that you currently
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.900]   do not see.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.540]   I want to say that as a prophetic word over us here at the Vine this morning.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.620]   That 2025 will be a year that some of us, all of us I hope, will see the things that
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.700]   we currently do not see.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.920]   That we would see with eyes of hope, with eyes of faith.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.980]   We would see with renewed vision.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.980]   We would see the things that have been planted long ago, we would suddenly see fruition.
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.540]   Even some of the things that we forgot that we'd planted.
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.900]   Some of the old prayers, some of the old dreams, some of the things that we've laid aside,
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.300]   that we're actually going to see the birthing, the budding, the flourishing, the fruit of
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.760]   those old dreams, old prayers, old promises.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.340]   We declare it so in the name of Jesus.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.740]   And Father, we are grateful that we stand before a living God.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.800]   That at the beginning of 2025, we're not praying to some statue.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.760]   We're not praying to an idol.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.800]   We're not praying to a philosophy.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.860]   We're praying to a God who is alive and present in this world.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.080]   We're praying to a God who is here in this room, who is with us always.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.380]   We're praying to a God who cares, who loves, who renews, who deepens us.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:26.060]   And so Lord, I want to pray that the living Spirit, in the name of Jesus, the living Spirit,
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.320]   would set fire in the hearts of everybody here at The Vine in 2025.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.860]   We need it, Lord.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.620]   Hong Kong needs it, Lord.
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.860]   We're not satisfied.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.860]   Come on, church.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.480]   We're not satisfied with what we see in our city, Lord.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.460]   We love our city.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.100]   We love the people of this city.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.020]   We love the leaders of this city.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.540]   We love the government of this city.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.420]   But Lord, we want to see things that we do not currently see in the Spirit and in the
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.700]   physical in this place, Lord.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.140]   And so Father, we pray that you would raise up a church, Lord.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.500]   You would raise up a church this year, Lord, who would have eyes of faith to believe in
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.380]   the greater things, Lord.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.360]   Who would look at the challenges and say, "That is nothing for my God."
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.720]   Who would say, "Hey, even if the fire burns me, I will still not give up on my God."
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.760]   Who would say, "Hey, even if the waters don't seem to part, I'm going to step my foot out
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   into the stream."
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.640]   Father, you are the one who is holy forever.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.040]   And Lord, we pray that you would light a fire in us.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.960]   I want to say that again.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.520]   Lord, I want to pray that you would light a fire in us for your Word, that your Word
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.840]   would come alive in us like never before, for your Spirit, that we would hunger and
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:52.440]   thirst for righteousness, for your justice, for the poor and the vulnerable and the marginalized.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.880]   Lord, you'd light a fire in us for the gospel and that we would see Hong Kong receive the
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.600]   gospel in 2025 like never before.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.080]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.760]   Hey, why don't you take a seat?
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.340]   Why don't you say hi to someone?
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.560]   Maybe they weren't standing with you when you started, but they're with you now.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.340]   Say hi to them.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.340]   Welcome them.
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.600]   Well, I'm so glad you're here.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   My name is Andrew.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.320]   I'm one of the pastors here, and we're really grateful that you're here on the first Sunday
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.320]   of 2025.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.320]   Can you believe 2025?
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   Allison said to us this morning that there are people that are just being born recently
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.320]   who will see the year 3000.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.720]   Get your head around that.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.440]   Okay, only that blew me away.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.440]   Okay, whatever.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.920]   I just thought that was cool.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.080]   My daughter might see the year 3000.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.320]   Anyway, I really believe as we're stepping into 2025, I really believe this.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.360]   We're about to begin what I believe is going to be the most significant year in the Vine's
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.680]   history.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.640]   I have so much excitement in my heart, so much longing for what I sense that God wants
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.640]   to do amongst us.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.840]   I believe that this will be our most significant year in the history of this church.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   I want to say this.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.680]   I think it's going to be your most significant year too, because the church isn't an institution.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.120]   It's not an organization, although we sometimes need those things in the fabric and structures
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.120]   of churches.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.640]   But the church, if it's anything, is the people.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.360]   And I believe that this can be, will be, and I'll say it in a prophetic way over you, your
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.240]   most significant year ever.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.240]   And I don't know how you feel as you step into 2025.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.720]   Perhaps some of you in here, you feel excited and expectant.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.600]   Maybe some of you feel cautious.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.520]   Maybe you're a bit careful as you step in.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.960]   Maybe 2024 was a difficult, challenging year, and you're not sure how 2025 is going to go,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.120]   and you're sort of tentatively stepping into the year.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.440]   Maybe you're stepping into this year with excitement, or whether you're a little bit
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   cautious.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.240]   Here's what I do know.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:06.240]   That the God that we worship and we serve is a God whose primary purpose is the movement
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.280]   of God's people forward into a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:18.400]   The primary focus that we have from God is to move his people forward to become more
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.120]   and more like Christ Jesus.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:27.400]   And if that is true, then surely this year has every chance to be your most significant
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.440]   year ever, because we don't serve a God who's going backwards.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.680]   Come on, church.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.800]   We don't serve a God who's heading back somewhere.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:42.120]   We serve a God who always moves forward, and therefore the church is always moving forward.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.400]   And actually the work of the Spirit is always to come and transform and change us.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.560]   Yes, so that we are transformed, but almost more than that, so that we would become an
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.200]   influence in our city, in our workplaces, in the places that we have an influence for
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.480]   his kingdom, for the gospel, for the hope that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:10.080]   In other words, God changes you so that you can partner with him in changing the world.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.000]   And I want you to hear this not in some sort of puffed up kind of, "Oh, it's the new year.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.480]   We're going to change the world."
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.840]   Only Jesus changes the world.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.320]   You don't change the world.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.160]   Jesus changes the world.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.840]   But here's the most profound thing.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.520]   It is Jesus that changes the world, but he's decided to do it through the church, through
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.560]   us, through broken vessels, through the ones that don't always have the answers, through
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.120]   the ones that don't always get it right, through the ones that have sin and are wrestling with
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.120]   sin.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.440]   God has decided in his infinite wisdom to choose the broken vessels of this world to
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.080]   bring his spirit and his hope and his gospel into the world.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.640]   And if God is moving forward, oh, how we should be moving forward.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.160]   We should be a church with momentum, a church on the go.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.720]   And so however you feel as you step into this year, and let's be honest, 2025, there's going
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.960]   to be some challenges.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.640]   We know that there are challenges in the world right now geopolitically, and perhaps they're
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.740]   going to get worse as we go forward.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.540]   And maybe you recognize that there are some challenges and some struggles in your own
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.820]   life right now.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.860]   This is personal for you.
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.880]   You also feel personal challenges, whatever challenges you might be facing.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.580]   We cannot start this year in retreat.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:30.660]   We cannot start this year defeated because if our God is a God of momentum, moving his
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:35.740]   people forward to become more like Christ Jesus, then surely we have to start this year
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.740]   saying I'm ready to go.
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.740]   Okay.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.740]   Try that again.
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.740]   No, I won't.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.740]   I'm not even going to try it again.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.740]   Okay.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.740]   We're just going to carry on.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.740]   Now, listen to this.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:54.100]   If we're going to be a church in Hong Kong that takes the gospel seriously in 2025, we
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.260]   have to take Jesus's word seriously.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.300]   And Jesus, right at the end of his life, gathers his disciples up on that mountain, doesn't
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.300]   he?
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.260]   And before his ascension, he's resurrected, so he's in his resurrection power, but it's
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.660]   before he ascends and he gathers his most faithful disciples around him.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.020]   There were 11 of them at that time.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.420]   And he speaks into them and he says these words.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.340]   He says, "All authority on heaven and earth has been given to me.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.700]   So now stay here."
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.700]   No, he didn't say that.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.900]   He did say that in a minute because he said, "Stay and wait for the Holy Spirit."
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.900]   But in this moment, he says, "Now go.
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.900]   Go.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.900]   I'm sending you," he says.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.700]   And you want to know what I'm sending you to do?
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.100]   He says, "I want you to make disciples of all the nations and I want you to baptize
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.180]   them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.460]   And then I want you to teach them to obey everything that I've commanded you.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.460]   And here's the kicker.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.000]   I will be with you.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.220]   Every step of the way, I will be with you."
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:52.340]   So Jesus is, one of his last words to his disciples is, "I have all authority and power.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.420]   So here's what I'm saying to you as the church.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.100]   I want you to go.
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.700]   I want you to go forward in that authority and power that is invested into you through
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.220]   the work of the Holy Spirit."
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.820]   That's why he says, "Wait and jurisdict until you receive the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.020]   Once you have that Holy Spirit, you are to go."
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.540]   And so we must be a church on the move.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.540]   Does that make sense?
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.820]   A church with mission.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:18.900]   So if 2025 is anything for the vine, it should be a year of action.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.100]   Now I want to just say that this is not some new calling for us.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.080]   This is not like some new vision or some fresh idea at the start of the year.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.940]   This has actually been birthed by the Holy Spirit in our community over multiple years
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.140]   of what the Lord's been doing amongst us.
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.120]   In fact, I want to actually pull the threads together a little bit this morning and help
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.620]   you to see what the Holy Spirit has been doing in us as a community.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.880]   In 2022, we felt called to heal.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.020]   It was right off the back of COVID.
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.860]   And we felt like the Holy Spirit said to us, "2022 is going to be a year of healing, a
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.340]   year of gathering back together for the first time after all that pandemic, after all the
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.900]   social distancing, even after the social movement that had happened in 2019 and 2020, as we
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.900]   gathered back together physically for the first time in 2022, we knew that we were being
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.260]   called to heal, that all of us were carrying some baggage.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.580]   In fact, one of the things that we said to us that year is that we need to shake the
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.580]   dust off.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.780]   We all had gotten a little bit dusty and it was great to get back together again in 2022.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.980]   Then in 2023, we felt God call us to Exodus.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.900]   We actually spent a whole year pretty much studying the book of Exodus in Scripture.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.260]   And in that book, we saw so many profound, important things for us as Christians, how
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.420]   God wants to bring us on a journey out of our slavery to sin into newness and freedom,
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.020]   into a promised land that He has given to us.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.100]   And we taught that year that Hong Kong is that promised land for us, and that we need
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.660]   to be an Exodus people, people that have been called out of slavery of sin into new life
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.380]   in Christ so that we can enter our promised land and do the things that God has on His
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.540]   heart for us to do.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.540]   That was 2023.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.780]   But then in 2024, we said, "God is calling us to intimacy."
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.180]   That was the word we had for us as a church that whole year.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.740]   Now, that made sense because you know what happened in Exodus.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.060]   God calls these people out of their slavery into sin, and He calls them out in order to
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.940]   call them in to His presence on Mount Sinai.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.100]   Remember that if you're around here in 2023?
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.420]   We were called out of our slavery in to His presence around Mount Sinai.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:23.860]   And so it followed that a year of Exodus would follow in 2024 to a year of intimacy.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.980]   And we invited you to connect deeply with God, to have time with Jesus, to make it a
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.140]   priority to fall more in love with Christ.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.900]   I had the blessing of having a sabbatical last year.
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.740]   And so that was a great way for me to do that.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.460]   And I know that many of us did that in lots of different ways.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.660]   It was a year of intimacy.
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.800]   But here's the important thing.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.180]   As a leadership, even though we discern that God was calling us into intimacy, we knew
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.880]   that that intimacy was actually on behalf of a bigger purpose.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.180]   And while it was important that we would connect with Jesus, fall more in love with Him, spend
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.300]   more time with Him last year, it was always on behalf of something else.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.900]   What you have to understand in Scripture is that intimacy is a platform, not a destination.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.100]   Come on, church.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.920]   Intimacy is a platform, not a destination.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.740]   Jesus actually said in John 15, where we get the name of the vine from, the very passage
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.700]   that we get it from, He says, "If you abide in Me, you will bear much fruit."
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:23.620]   In other words, there's stuff that will happen out of the intimacy you have with Me.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:29.780]   So intimacy is this platform through which and from which we are able to serve.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.740]   If we serve without the intimacy, we will burn out.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:39.500]   But if we abide in Him, we are able to do more in our city, more in the world around
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.460]   us out of that abiding in Him.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.260]   So intimacy is a platform, not a destination.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.780]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:51.980]   So that is why as we head into 2025, we knew that intimacy was not always going to be there.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.960]   We knew that actually this year is a call to action.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.620]   This is to take that fruit that hopefully every single one of us has received last year
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:06.460]   and begin to sow that fruit into our workplaces, into the places of influence that we have,
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.860]   into the city that we love so much.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.980]   We are called this year out of intimacy into action.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.580]   That doesn't mean that we let go of intimacy.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.460]   It doesn't mean that that was a 2024 thing.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.420]   You don't need to be intimate with Jesus anymore.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:24.540]   We have to abide in Him, remain in Him, but we have to shift our mentality from just being
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:30.740]   with Him to being with Him for a purpose, being with Him so that we can partner with
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.140]   Him to change the world.
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.020]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.740]   Okay, now that flow is where our challenge lies.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.380]   Here's the challenge.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:46.680]   It's not easy to go from intimacy to action because intimacy is good.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.220]   Intimacy is comfortable.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.780]   Intimacy is awesome.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.060]   It was great to stand up last year and say, "Hey, be more intimate with Jesus."
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.740]   You were all like, "Yes!"
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.780]   Now I'm standing up and saying, "Hey, take the gospel to your workplace."
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.420]   And you're like, "Hmm, that's a little bit different, right?"
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:08.380]   It's easier to remain in a place of intimacy because intimacy is awesome, it's comfortable,
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.140]   it's good, but then stepping out of intimacy into action, that requires a shift.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.980]   That requires something new.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.860]   That's not a straightforward transition.
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.680]   And so here's what we want to do at the start of 2025.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:26.540]   If God is calling us to a year of action, then how do we go from intimacy to action
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.540]   well?
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.900]   And over the next four Sundays, we're going to actually explore that with you.
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.260]   And we're going to look at Samuel and David.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.300]   The reason why we're looking at Samuel and David in the Old Testament is because they
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.120]   both went through times of intimacy into action in their lives.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.460]   And so we're going to see how they do that transition to help us understand ours.
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:51.060]   But also, they go through what I would say are mindset changes in order to do the things
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.980]   that God has called them to do.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:58.980]   They had old mindsets that they needed to let go of in order to embrace a new mindset
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.420]   to be able to do what it is that God had for them to do.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.260]   And I think it's the same also for us.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:10.020]   I think we need some mindset changes as we step into 2025 for the things that God has
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.820]   for the vine to do in its future.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.460]   And again, by that, has for you to do in your sphere of influence.
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.100]   And so we're going to talk about four things.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.820]   Next week, we're going to talk about having the right choices.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.340]   We'll talk about choices.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.100]   A week after that, we're going to talk about having the right kind of resources in our
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.860]   lives and how we're using those resources.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.340]   We're going to talk about after that, the right community and the people that we have
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.340]   around us.
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.660]   Are they the right people that we have around us?
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.760]   And then finally, or actually today, we're going to talk about having the right start.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.540]   How do we actually begin?
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.020]   How do we get our starting point right?
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.400]   Because here's the thing.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.380]   If you don't start from the right place, you're going to easily drift.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.420]   How do we make sure we're all starting in exactly the place that we should start?
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.620]   The question is, how do we begin?
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.100]   Well, let me tell you something that I think is really important as we begin to think about
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.020]   a mindset shift.
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:10.660]   Psychologists, counselors, therapists, they will tell you that there are five emotional
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.580]   barriers that all of us have, or all of us struggle with at some point.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:23.020]   Five emotional barriers that actually block us, inhibit us, stop us from moving forward
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.540]   in whatever it might be in our human life.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.940]   Whether that might be moving forward into a new job, moving forward into a new relationship,
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.740]   moving forward into a goal or a dream we have.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:39.120]   There are five emotional barriers that will stop you, inhibit you, slow you down from
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   your forward momentum.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.120]   Does that make sense?
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.620]   You want to know what those five are?
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:48.060]   Hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.060]   Say it again.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.860]   Hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, failure.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:20:00.740]   Those five things are the emotional barriers that will inhibit you from moving forward
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.420]   with excitement into a new thing in your life.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:09.420]   When hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure are upon us, are a part of us,
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.220]   they become barriers to our growth.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.980]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.980]   Now here's the thing.
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.700]   They're not just barriers to our general human movement.
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.380]   They're also barriers spiritually as well.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.060]   In fact, you can go to the Bible and you can see many examples of God's people struggling
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.100]   with hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.940]   And that in the struggle, they find themselves held back from what it is that God wants to
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.940]   do with them.
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:41.040]   And they find it difficult to shift out of the old and into the new.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:47.900]   And the burden that I felt sitting on me as I was preparing this message today is that
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:53.220]   I feel like for me, but I also feel like for many of us here, many of us watching online
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.700]   right now, here's the reality.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.900]   Because hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure has had such an impact on us at
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:05.140]   times, we actually think that we're kind of on plan B now for our lives.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.980]   It's like, that was really hard.
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.940]   I went through a really traumatic time, or I had a really bad breakdown in a relationship,
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.340]   or I tried a job and I got fired and it was really, really hard for me.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.900]   And we have these situations where we're sitting heavy with the weight of our brokenness from
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.980]   something that's happened in our past.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.540]   That hurt and that disappointment, that shame and that regret, that kind of tethers us,
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.540]   anchors us to that.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:35.380]   And we begin to think, well, I guess I'll just live a plan B kind of life then.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.620]   I guess the only life that's really available for me now is not the life that I hoped for,
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.260]   not the life that I believe that God had put in my heart.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.700]   I guess that's kind of failed.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.700]   That hasn't worked out.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.980]   I guess I'm going to live a half life.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.340]   It's still a pretty decent one, but it's not quite the one that I was hoping it would be.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.660]   And particularly when we're dealing out of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame and failure
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:01.460]   because of sin, we then get the mentality of, I'm not worthy of the life that Christ
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.940]   wants me to have.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.180]   I'm not worthy to be used by him in the way that he wants to use me.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.180]   I hear Pastor Andrew on a Sunday and the other pastors speak.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.220]   I read the Bible and I see what God does in other people, but that's everybody else's
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.220]   story.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.940]   If they knew the sin that was in my life, they would know that that's not my story and
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.620]   that shouldn't be my story.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.100]   Are you with me?
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.420]   And so because of that, we think we're on plan B or maybe some of us plan C, D, E and
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:33.980]   F. And you have no anticipation as you step into 2025 that actually maybe you're still
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:39.740]   on plan A. That actually the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret and failure does not have to
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.220]   determine your future.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:51.260]   See, when the hurt, disappointment, shame and failure of our past speaks louder to us
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:57.420]   than the hope of our future, we are always in danger of missing out on the most significant
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:02.340]   moments of influence and impact we can have in this world.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:09.020]   Always in danger of missing out on the most significant moments of impact and influence
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.420]   that we could have in the world around us.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:16.620]   And I don't want a church, and I don't think you do either, that is so tethered to its
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:23.860]   brokenness of its past that it isn't impacting and influencing the world in the way that
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.100]   the cross of Calvary says it should.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.220]   Jesus said, "I have built this church.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:36.100]   I will build this church and the gates of hell will not pervade against it."
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.660]   And as we step into this new year, I wonder whether we could step in actually believing
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.660]   that.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.300]   So if you struggle with hurt, disappointment, shame, regret and failure, you're human, number
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.620]   one.
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.340]   Number two, you're just like me.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.060]   And number three, the scripture has something important to say to you.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.220]   I want to frame that by sharing with you about the story of Samuel.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:58.220]   I don't know if you know much about Samuel in the Old Testament.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.340]   Samuel lived this incredible life.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.300]   I'm going to pick up the story right at the end of Samuel's life though, because I want
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.220]   to show you the transition that takes place here.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:10.660]   Right at the end of Samuel's life, he's so old that the leaders of Israel come to him
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.420]   and they say these very words, "You are very old."
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.620]   Can you imagine that?
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.580]   Imagine your boss coming up to you saying, "You are very old."
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.860]   So basically, he's at the end of his life, okay?
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.380]   And here's the thing you need to know about Samuel.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.440]   He's lived an amazing life.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.140]   This guy's lived an incredible life.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.460]   He's been a judge of Israel for the majority of his life.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.260]   And as a judge, he was the leader of the nation at that time.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.020]   Now you can see in the book of Judges, the book of 1 and 2 Kings and all this, you can
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.500]   see that actually the judges really struggled, many of them, with sin and brokenness, and
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.300]   they didn't lead God's people very well.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.980]   Samuel, however, did.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:51.540]   He's one of the few judges that was actually upright, who actually had moral integrity,
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.860]   who actually loved God, who actually served him and obeyed his word.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.340]   And he did an incredible job with Israel.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.700]   And at the end of his life, success becomes a problem for him.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.500]   Anybody else in this room, has that ever been in your case?
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.500]   Just me?
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.500]   No, it's okay.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.100]   Success can become a problem, right?
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.380]   And so for him, he's done this amazing job, but he's done it so well that the leaders
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:16.260]   of Israel come to him and say, "You're very old, which means you're going to die soon,
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:21.300]   which means your sons will become judges, but your sons are not like you.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.700]   Your sons don't have the same character you do.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.580]   Your sons are not the same upright integrity that you have.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.860]   We don't want your sons to lead us.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.820]   And because we don't want your sons to lead us, here's what we want you to do.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.580]   We want you to anoint a king.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.440]   We want to start a monarchy now.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.660]   We want to be like the other nations that we see, who have kings and queens.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.140]   We want that for ourselves too.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.180]   We do not want your sons, Samuel.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.180]   Oh, you've been a great judge, but you've been a terrible father."
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.180]   Woo!
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.180]   Imagine how...
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.180]   They didn't actually say that.
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.340]   I added that to Scripture, but I think that's kind of what they were saying.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.180]   Could you imagine how hurt Samuel would be?
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.460]   I mean, he's given his life to these people.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.500]   He served them as best as he can.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:07.500]   And right at the end of his life, the people have come and said, "We don't want your family
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.500]   anymore."
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.980]   The hurt, the disappointment.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.540]   I think he was hurt because he wanted to defend his sons, I'm sure.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.900]   But I think he was hurt more than that because he felt like he had been rejected by his people,
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.380]   him personally.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.300]   In fact, we know that because he comes to God and it's recorded for us in Scripture.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.500]   He comes to God and he prays a prayer.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.500]   He says this.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.860]   He says, "Lord, I'm distraught because they have rejected me."
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.820]   And God, in only the way that God can, comes to him and says, "No, no, no, no, Samuel.
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:37.980]   They've not rejected you.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.260]   They've rejected me as king over them."
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:45.660]   In other words, God always saw himself as their king, as the ultimate ruler.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.760]   And when they came and asked for a king, God was like, "They're trying to usurp my power
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.760]   and my authority.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.260]   They haven't rejected you, Samuel.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.260]   They've actually rejected me."
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.920]   And God, because he's compassionate and loving and faithful and committed, he says these
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   words to Samuel.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.540]   He said, "Look, if they want a monarchy, we can work through a monarchy."
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.900]   He's basically like, "My redemptive purposes are not going to be thwarted by some human
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.900]   idea.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.980]   If it's a monarchy they want, a monarchy can happen.
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:15.580]   I can still bring my redemptive purposes to the world through that."
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.580]   And so he says this thing to Samuel.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.300]   He says, "Samuel, I want you to pick up your horn.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.420]   I want you to fill it with oil.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.820]   And then I want you to pour it over the one I'm about to anoint as king."
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:29.900]   Now for Samuel, he as a prophet and judge, he would have a horn, not too dissimilar to
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.660]   something like this.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:36.540]   And in the horn, what he would do is he would pour anointing oil, perfumed oil into it.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.700]   And then he would choose an amazingly good looking man like this man right here.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.180]   And he would come up to him and he would say, "Okay, the Lord's going to use this man for
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.180]   leadership."
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.480]   And he would pour that anointing oil over his head.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.660]   And that was a prophetic symbol to say that this person has now been anointed to lead
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.620]   or to be a prophet or whatever it is.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:56.540]   So when God says to Samuel, "Grab your horn, fill it with oil because I'm about to use
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.740]   it," it's saying to Samuel, "There's one more thing I want you to do.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.100]   You're very old, but there's one more thing.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.140]   You can hold your horn.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.140]   You can do what I'm asking you to do."
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.500]   And so he goes, "I want you to go and anoint this guy called Saul."
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.500]   And so he goes to Saul and he anoints Saul.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.420]   Now Saul says these beautiful words when he's anointed.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:16.560]   He says, "Who am I that I would be chosen out of all of Israel to be the one?
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.760]   Like my clan is the smallest, my tribe is the smallest.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.200]   I can't believe I've been chosen."
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.240]   There's this beautiful humility in Saul.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.100]   And everything in the story at this point seems to be going quite well.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.200]   And then Saul begins to lead.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.800]   Now I don't know if you've ever tried to lead, but leadership is not easy.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.400]   And he gets seduced by power.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.760]   Not the only or first leader in the world to have been seduced by power.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.680]   He gets seduced so much by power.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.040]   He gets a taste of it so much that within a short period of time,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.680]   begins to erect statues of himself around all of the cities of the land.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.720]   Because he wanted his people to begin to look to him for authority
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.280]   rather than to look to God.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.560]   "They've not rejected you, Samuel.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.640]   They rejected me as king."
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.640]   And Saul begins to live a life where he actually begins to disobey the things
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.000]   that God is asking him to do.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.440]   Erect statues for people to basically essentially worship him, to look to him.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.080]   And this so grieves heart of God.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.560]   So grieves God's heart that he comes to Samuel and he says,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.920]   "Samuel, I'm so grieved that I have made Saul king over Israel.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.520]   I'm lifting my anointing from him."
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.040]   This throws Samuel into another cycle.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.720]   And this cycle is regret, shame, and failure.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.360]   Because suddenly Samuel's feeling like this, "I'm at the end of my life.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.440]   And I've just anointed the last act that I've done in my life is to anoint this one
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.000]   to be king.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.800]   I've then stood aside, my family has stood aside.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.480]   We've made space for this to happen.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.880]   And this guy has been seduced by power.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.960]   And now God has lifted his anointing."
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:57.360]   Samuel's feeling like, "My last act of life has been a failure.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.040]   The last thing I've done has failed.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.240]   It hasn't worked out.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.480]   What kind of prophet?
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.680]   What kind of judge?
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.560]   What kind of leader?
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.880]   What kind of legacy?
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.080]   Am I leaving behind when the last thing I did didn't work out well?"
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:16.920]   The shame, the shame of being the one that actually anointed the wrong person,
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.840]   if you will, the one who grieves the heart of the Lord.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.040]   How did that all happen?
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:27.040]   And Samuel is so wallowing deeply in his brokenness, in the hurt, disappointment,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:33.560]   shame, regret, and failure of what's just happened to him that he is completely
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.000]   at a loss.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.800]   I wonder if you've ever felt that way.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.200]   I wonder if you've ever had a moment in your life where maybe something you've
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:51.040]   done in your past has so filled you with regret, so filled you with hurt that you're
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.840]   filled with shame just thinking about it.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.800]   And that whole thing, you've either tried to ignore it, tried to bury it,
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:04.120]   tried to avoid it, or it's so consumed you that it's been difficult for you to get
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.720]   out of bed the next day.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.680]   I wonder if it's just me who's felt that way.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.120]   I'm sure all of us, right, to some degree can connect to where Samuel is in this
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.120]   moment.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.040]   Perhaps for you, it's a relationship.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:22.040]   Perhaps you've got a failed relationship in your life, maybe a failed marriage,
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.080]   and the hurt of that, the disappointment in that, the shame of that's holding you
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.160]   back.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.080]   Perhaps it's a work thing.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.200]   Maybe you tried for a job and you didn't get the job, or maybe you had a job and you
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.360]   got fired, or you lost your job, or you were made redundant or something,
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.600]   and that's sitting heavy on you.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.960]   Perhaps it's a financial decision.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.680]   Maybe you made an investment in something and that investment didn't work out.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.680]   You put it all in and it didn't come through.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.400]   And that still stings, and you're still embarrassed about that.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.760]   And you feel like you hurt your loved ones because you made a choice that didn't work
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.800]   out, that it failed.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:58.920]   I think we all can connect with Samuel in some way, can't we?
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.280]   God shows up to Samuel in this place of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame,
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.520]   and failure.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.040]   And he speaks to him some words that if you're feeling anything like what Samuel
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.400]   was feeling in that moment, I think God's saying these words over you today.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.120]   Because these words change everything for Samuel.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.320]   And as I unpack them for you now, I pray that they will change everything
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:24.520]   for you, and that you will be able to start 2025 walking forward.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.280]   Let me read this to you from 1 Samuel, chapter 15, starting in verse 34,
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.400]   and I'm just going to read a few verses.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:36.680]   "Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gebeah of Saul.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.560]   Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again,
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.760]   though Samuel mourned for him.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.400]   And the Lord was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.080]   The Lord said to Samuel, 'How long will you mourn for Saul,
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.800]   since I have rejected him as king over Israel?
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.880]   Fill your horn with oil and be on your way, for I'm sending you now to Jesse
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.760]   of Bethlehem, for I have chosen one of his sons to be king.'"
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.000]   So I want you to picture this.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.280]   Samuel was in a place of hurt, disappointment, reject, shame,
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.480]   and failure.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.160]   He's right at the end of his life, and he thinks his life is done,
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.480]   everything's done.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.320]   And he's mourning, grieving, hurting for all the things that have just happened
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.600]   at the end of his life.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.840]   And God shows up and says these words.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.800]   Let me read this again.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.960]   "How long will you mourn for Saul?"
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.120]   I want you to see a couple of things here.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.600]   Notice what God doesn't say.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.760]   God does not say, "Why are you mourning for Saul?"
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.440]   He says, "How long will you mourn for Saul?"
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.200]   It's a subtle but very important difference.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.280]   Could you imagine if you were Samuel and you're feeling the worst that you've ever
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.480]   felt in your life?
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.360]   You're feeling a failure, you're burnt out, you're feeling like what you've just done
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.280]   just didn't work out, and God shows up and says, "Why?
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.040]   Why are you feeling that way?"
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.840]   Can you imagine how that would feel?
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.360]   I mean, that would be a bit weird, wouldn't it?
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   God was saying, "Why are you doing that?
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   Why would you do that?
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.160]   You shouldn't do that.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:56.960]   I've given up on that one.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.360]   I gave up on him a long way ago.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.080]   I've rejected him.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.520]   Come on, why are you feeling this way?"
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.760]   It's so beautiful to me that God doesn't show up to Samuel and say,
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.680]   "Why are you feeling this way?"
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.400]   Instead, he shows up to him and goes, "I understand why you're feeling this way.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.480]   Like, I totally get it.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.880]   You're in a place of mourning.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   I'm not asking you why you're in a place of mourning because I know you're human,
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.600]   and you've just gone through something that was really hard, and you feel the shame,
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.040]   and you feel the embarrassment, and you feel the brokenness, and I get it.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.960]   You're mourning."
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.640]   And I think it's beautiful because in God saying, "How long will you mourn?"
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.200]   Notice, God is giving him space to mourn.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.240]   He's giving him space to wrestle with that feeling.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.840]   He's giving him a space to process what has happened to him.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.680]   He's not expecting him to get immediately better.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.920]   How long will you mourn saying, basically, "There's a place for mourning."
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.280]   Hear this, church.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.520]   There's a place for mourning.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.320]   There's a place to wrestle with the brokenness, to wrestle with the things
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.480]   that we've done that we're not proud of.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.200]   There's a place to bring our sin before the Lord and not to have to walk
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.400]   in the brokenness anymore.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.000]   There's a place to receive the forgiveness, and the healing,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.760]   and the restoration.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.160]   There's a place for mourning.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.440]   This is why we have the Psalms in the Scriptures because the Psalms are the
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.080]   beautiful poetic voice of Israel saying, "Hey, it's okay.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.360]   We feel this way, God.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.600]   We feel this way, but we're going to trust.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.520]   We know that you're still for us even though it feels like you're a long,
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.520]   long way away from us, even though you've kind of forsaken us."
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.560]   The Psalms are this beautiful, honest reflection of God's people crying out
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.560]   and saying, "We're hurting.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.160]   This is not easy.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.040]   This is a painful experience."
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.360]   And God is saying, "There's space for that."
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.400]   Jesus himself in Matthew 5, 4, in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.240]   he says these beautiful words.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:47.440]   He says, "Blessed are those who are mourned for they will be comforted."
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.720]   Blessed are those who mourn.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.600]   Blessed are those that process the hurt and the feelings in them.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.040]   For I, here's my promise to them, I promise I will comfort them.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.080]   I promise my Spirit will be there for them.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.960]   I promise they will not go through it alone.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.440]   That's the wonderful heart of God.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.400]   And so I want to say this to some of you in this room.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.520]   Some of you here are in a season of mourning.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.800]   And I want to say that's absolutely good.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.400]   That's fine.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.360]   In fact, your season of mourning is your greatest opportunity to receive the comfort
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.120]   of the presence of Jesus.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.240]   And so if you're in a season of mourning in this room, our prayer for you is that we
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:23.800]   will be with you.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.560]   We'll stand with you.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.400]   We'll be the support to you.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.840]   We will pray for you and we will hope that the comfort of Christ will be known
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.440]   in your life.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.960]   We'll journey with you forever, however long it takes.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.480]   If you're mourning here, we love you and we're here for you.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.960]   Are you with me?
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.040]   I don't want you to hear anything else if that's your season right now.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.080]   The only thing I want you to take away from today is that God will comfort you.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.400]   Jesus will comfort you.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.000]   And we as a church, we're here for you.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.640]   But I want you to see this.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.520]   By God coming to Samuel and saying, "How long are you going to mourn?"
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.280]   God understands something that Samuel needed to understand.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.160]   And it's really important that at some point, mourning has to finish for new
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.840]   life to begin.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.960]   Come on, church.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:14.360]   At some point, mourning has to stop for new life to begin.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.720]   I don't know how you sleep at night.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.400]   Let me explain.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.240]   We're going to get intimate now.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.360]   I'm going to explain to you how I sleep at night.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.360]   When I sleep at night, I sleep with my arms under the pillow.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.240]   Anyone ever do that?
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.200]   Like you put your arms under your pillow, with the two arms or one arm?
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.840]   I like to sleep with one arm under my pillow.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.240]   Now, the problem with that is about twice a night, I will wake up in the middle
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.760]   of the night, and I've been leaning my whole body weight on one arm.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.960]   And that means that arm is now dead.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.520]   Like all the blood has been pushed out of that arm.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.080]   You ever had like a dead arm, right?
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.640]   And if you're leaning on it and your arm is dead, the funny thing is you can't kind
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.400]   of move because you can't push off.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.080]   So you have to get your other hand and sort of push off the mattress,
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.720]   and then your hand just sort of stays there, and then you've got to grab it,
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.360]   and it sort of flops like this because there's no blood in it.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.560]   And then you move on to your other side, and about two hours later,
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.760]   you wake up and that arm's dead, right?
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.400]   This is like a repetitive thing in my life.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.800]   When God comes to Samuel and says, "How long are you going to mourn?"
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.720]   He's basically saying, "We do this with ourselves spiritually.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.720]   We do this with ourselves emotionally.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:17.280]   When we hold on to the mourning of something for too long, it's like that thing
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.320]   remains dead.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.600]   You remain dead.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:25.000]   And for new life to come, you have to let go at some point.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.800]   You have to move forward at some point."
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.440]   And he comes to Samuel and says, "How long are you going to mourn?"
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.400]   Which is actually an invitation for Samuel to both mourn, yes,
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.560]   but also to realize that at some point, that's going to have to stop and that God
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.640]   will be there for him.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.920]   And when God is there for him, things will begin to change.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.080]   Some of you in this room, you're struggling to find a new
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.080]   relationship in your life because you're still holding on to the old one that's
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.840]   long been dead.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.240]   Some of you are struggling to find that job that's your career job that you'd
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:02.160]   love to do because you're hanging on to the old job out of fear of lack of security
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.560]   for the future.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.800]   You're holding on to the job you hate, and that's keeping you from the job you
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.680]   really want to receive.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.600]   Or what it might be in any area of our lives, but we can all go through this.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.080]   And I want you to see something that's happening here.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.120]   When God says to Samuel, "How long are you going to mourn?"
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.200]   Here's essentially what's happening for Samuel.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.920]   Samuel is so consumed to the mourning of his past that he is ignorant,
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.800]   he's blind to the importance of his future.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.240]   I want you to see this because this is what happens for all of us in these five
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.400]   emotional barriers.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:36.560]   He's so consumed by the past that he's blind to the importance of his future.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.160]   He thinks he has no future.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.720]   He thinks his story is done.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.200]   "I anointed one and he failed.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.680]   That's my postscript.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.320]   I'm leaving this world with that.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.040]   I am done."
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.240]   And God says, "You don't understand, Samuel, but you are standing in this
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.560]   moment right in the most significant moment of human history."
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:03.360]   Samuel has no idea the importance of what's ahead of him, but God knows.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.640]   And because God sees what is just ahead of Samuel, he says, "How long are you
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.160]   going to mourn?"
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.440]   Samuel is thinking, "Hang on a sec.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.560]   Everything's done for me."
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:17.080]   And God's saying, "You can't see what it is that I'm about to do for you."
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.560]   Think about this.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:23.120]   Samuel, and we're going to see this next week, Samuel is about to go and anoint,
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.800]   he's about to pour oil over David.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:33.720]   David, who would become the starting point of the Davidic dynasty that Jewish people
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.240]   and Christians believe, or Jewish people believe will come eventually for a
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.200]   Messiah, Christians believe came in Jesus.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.680]   Samuel is about to pour oil over the very one who will start the bloodline that will
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.520]   bring Jesus Christ.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.640]   Get your head around that.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.680]   Samuel is about to start the process for Jesus.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.680]   He has no idea.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   He has no idea that he's standing at the most critical moment of human history
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.280]   because he's so blinded by the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret,
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.440]   and failure.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.560]   But God sees.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.840]   I want you to see this, church.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.480]   God sees.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.240]   God sees David.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.160]   God sees the bloodline.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.560]   God sees Jesus.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:20.040]   And God sees Jesus' life and ministry and miracles and teaching.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.320]   He sees his death on the cross and the horror of that, but the importance of that
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.360]   for liberation for sin.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.080]   He sees his resurrection and the filling of the Holy Spirit upon him.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.440]   He sees him gathering disciples and giving them the great commission.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.200]   He sees them receiving the Holy Spirit in the upper room.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.360]   He sees them begin the church with their own sweat and blood,
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.280]   some of them martyred for their faith.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.200]   He sees over 2,000 years, the church grow in history.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:50.600]   He even sees the first Sunday of 2025 and you sitting at the vine hearing the
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:51.960]   message right now.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.640]   He sees all of that.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.200]   And because of the worth and the value of all of that, he comes to Samuel and he
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.760]   says, "How long?
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.960]   How long?
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:13.560]   How long are you going to mourn because Jesus is coming?"
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.680]   It's really important.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.720]   I think that we all hear this.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   Some of us have Davids right up ahead of us in our future, but we're in danger of
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.760]   failing to receive them because we're still holding on to our souls.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:34.680]   Which soul as you start 2025 are you holding on to that is blinding you to the
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.320]   wonder of what the Lord wants to do in you?
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:44.080]   The David that's there, your dream job, a new relationship,
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.480]   maybe a goal that you've longed had for.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.320]   Maybe that moment of life that you've been dreaming and praying for,
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.080]   that budding of the bamboo shoot that's going to come out of the ground.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.880]   It's right there in front of you.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.560]   He sees it.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:04.480]   And he says, "How long are you going to mourn?"
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.600]   How do we then respond to this?
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.720]   Well, notice what he says to Samuel 16, chapter 16, verse 1.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.720]   He says, "The Lord said to Samuel, 'How long will you mourn for Saul since I've
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.920]   rejected him as king over Israel?
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.600]   Fill your horn with oil and be on your way.'"
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.680]   Isn't that a beautiful thing?
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.160]   See, Samuel thought it was all over.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.680]   My last act as a judge was to pour oil over Saul.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:28.960]   What a mistake that was.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.440]   I'm never doing that again.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.800]   Oh, I don't want to take the risk of that again.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.120]   Oh, if I step out and try that again, oh man, that's going to fail.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.040]   I did that once and it sucked.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.200]   It sucked so hard because God's heart was grieved, my heart was grieved.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.520]   I hurt, shamed.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.600]   Disappointment, failure.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.760]   Why would I ever bother to do that again?
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.200]   You could imagine Samuel thinking.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:57.400]   And God says, "Have the courage, Samuel, to pick up your horn, fill it with oil and
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.560]   be on your way."
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.120]   In other words, here's what Samuel hears.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.080]   I love this.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:07.280]   Samuel hears God say to him, "I am not done with you yet."
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.720]   Come on, church.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.240]   I'm not done with you yet.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.360]   Who told you I was finished with you?
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.960]   You told yourself that.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.320]   You let the hurt, shame, disappointment, regret, frame, failure all tell you that.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.960]   I never told you that.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.320]   I never said your life was over.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.120]   I never said you were too old.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.960]   That was Israel who said that to you.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.800]   I never said that you were a failure.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.320]   None of those words ever came from me.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.400]   Here's what I'm saying to you.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.920]   Pick up your horn because I'm not done with you yet.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.840]   Because there's something you're about to do that will be a legacy for the whole of
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.280]   the human race.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.440]   Grab your horn, he says.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.240]   And here's what I want to say to some of you this morning.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.880]   Pick up your horn.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.720]   Pick up your horn.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.960]   For Samuel, it was a literal horn.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.960]   For you, it's not a literal horn.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.520]   That would be weird.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.040]   But the horn was a symbol for Samuel of what he had been called to do.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.440]   What's that tool for you?
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.440]   What have you been called to do?
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.320]   For some of you, that's your work.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.320]   That's your business.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.440]   Grab a hold of it like never before.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.280]   Some of you, that's the ability to pray.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.360]   Pray like never before.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.040]   Some of you, that's a gift or a talent to communicate.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.400]   Pray like you've never done before.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.280]   For some of you, it might be whatever it is.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.680]   Whatever God has put on your heart, whatever talent or gift, whatever tool he has given
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:21.160]   you to be able to share the gospel, and he's given it to every single person, grab your
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.520]   horn.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.080]   Don't allow shame, regret, failure, disappointment, and hurt define your future.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.680]   He is not done with you yet.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.680]   Come on, church.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.920]   He's not done with you yet.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.800]   There's so much more ahead for you.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.000]   So much more ahead for me.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   I'm turning 50.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.120]   Oh, I feel like he's done with me.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.120]   I'm turning 50 in a month.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.640]   Oh, Lord Jesus.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.560]   The eldest came to me the other day.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:55.480]   "Andrew, you are very old," they said.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.480]   Just kidding.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   The eldest didn't say that.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   He's not done with me yet.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.480]   Honestly, I'm preaching to myself.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:03.400]   I feel a bit emotional right now.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.560]   I'm preaching to myself.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.240]   He's not done with me yet.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.240]   He's not done with you.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.240]   How old you are in this room?
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   50 is not old.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:15.360]   There might be some older people here watching online.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.360]   I see you, John.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.000]   I love you.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.400]   He's not done with you yet.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   Amen?
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   Now, notice this.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.240]   He says, sorry, I'm going to finish soon.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.080]   He says here, he says, "Fill your horn with oil."
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.080]   I love this.
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.560]   He doesn't say, "Fill your horn with your own strength.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:36.040]   Fill your horn with just your good news or your good works."
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.320]   He doesn't say, "Fill the horn with your talent."
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.000]   He said, "Fill it with my oil.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.680]   Fill it with the oil of the Holy Spirit."
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:46.840]   It's only Jesus that brings our dead tools to life.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:51.480]   It's only Jesus that takes those talents and uses them to do something in the kingdom.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.400]   Remember, it's him who changes the world.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:59.280]   We're just empty, broken vessels, but when the oil of the Holy Spirit comes on us, we
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.480]   are able to do like the disciples did in that upper room, things that they never thought
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.280]   they would ever be able to do.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.480]   Think changes and transforms when you're filled with Jesus.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.880]   Notice this.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.720]   When sin happened in Genesis 3, all of humanity was brought into a place of brokenness and
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.400]   the whole of creation was.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:23.140]   And the Bible describes it like this, that all of creation has been mourning.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:27.800]   And Jesus is described to us through the Old Testament as the horn of our salvation.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:35.640]   In other words, Jesus is the vessel that God decided to choose to pour out on humanity.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:41.320]   The one who has decided to bring hope and freedom and life to broken, sinful humanity.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.600]   Jesus is the horn of our salvation.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.560]   And so if there's anyone that we come to to receive the oil from, to receive the Spirit
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.280]   of God from, surely it's Christ.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.280]   It has to be Christ.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   It's only Christ.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.420]   He is the horn that God has provided that is poured out over you.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.820]   So when he says, "Pick up your horn," he's like, "I've already picked up mine.
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:07.240]   My horn went to the cross for you, rose from the dead for you, forgives your sins for you.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   You are forgiven."
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.880]   That doesn't mean you're going to have this perfect, sunny, shiny life all the time, but
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.800]   it means that even in mourning, you are comforted.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.800]   Amen?
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:20.120]   Even in the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure, that is not the end of your story.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:24.960]   I am there with you and I will walk you into the new thing that I have for you.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:31.700]   2025 will be your most significant year yet, because he would say over to you, "I am not
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.760]   done with you.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.920]   Do not allow the soul to stop you from the David.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.120]   How long will you mourn?"
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.320]   I wonder whether you'd close your eyes with me.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.240]   I want to just pray and we're going to make some space.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.240]   We've got plenty of time.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   So we've designed the service today specifically to give us more time.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.620]   And as your eyes are closed, I want to just explain in a moment, we're going to invite
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.680]   you to come forward for communion.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:04.040]   Now just keep your eyes closed, but let me explain.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.160]   In a moment, we're going to invite you to come forward for communion.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:11.160]   Normally here at the Vine, we pass communion out to you and you receive it that way.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.720]   But today we want you to be active.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.960]   We want you to take action.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:19.080]   Want you to be in the prophetic side of this word.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.400]   And so we want you to come forward.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.400]   So there's going to be four stations in the front here.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.440]   There's two on either side in the lower house as well.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.120]   Upstairs there's two at the front and two at the back.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:35.000]   And in a moment, you'll be invited in your own time when you're ready to come and receive
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.300]   communion for one of our leaders or elders here.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.040]   And we will bless you as you receive the communion.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:44.840]   Then you can take it back and you can take communion in your chair with your friends,
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:50.200]   family, whoever you're here with, or if you're on your own, you can take it on your own.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.040]   But before you come forward for communion, we want to give you space to receive what
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.600]   the Holy Spirit has for you.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:02.880]   In some ways today, the communion is the coming forward after we felt like the Lord has ministered
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   to us.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.480]   And so we're going to create some space for you now to receive the ministry of the Holy
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.480]   Spirit.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:13.640]   It's the most important part of our service and I want to encourage that in a couple of
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   ways.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:20.160]   Maybe something I've shared today, maybe you recognize it hurt, disappointment, shame,
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.800]   regret and failure has dominated your thinking too much.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:30.060]   Maybe you recognize that you're holding onto a soul.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:34.280]   Maybe you feel like you're not worthy of a David.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:41.720]   Maybe you're entering 2025 locked and anchored and tethered into the past when the Lord says
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:49.080]   this is going to be your most significant year yet.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:53.400]   But if you're anything like me, hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, failure, those are powerful
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.160]   things.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:51:02.760]   And when the Lord said to Samuel, "Fill your home with oil," what he's basically saying
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:06.080]   to you is how long will you go before you invite my Holy Spirit into that part of your
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:10.120]   life?
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:16.720]   How long will you go until you invite my Spirit into the hurt, into the disappointment, into
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:21.120]   the regret and the shame and the failure?
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.960]   For I'm here and I will comfort those who mourn.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.120]   Maybe for some of you, you've been carrying around those five things so much because you
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.600]   haven't had the courage to invite the Spirit in.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.680]   Maybe it's been too painful to invite the Spirit in.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:43.520]   I want to encourage you to be brave at the start of this year.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:48.160]   And so in this ministry time before you come for communion, you can just take your time
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:52.880]   to invite Him into those areas.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.400]   Ask Him to help you to let go of your soul.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:02.000]   Ask Him to show you what He sees about your future, how much He loves you, how much He's
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.360]   prepared that's just ahead of you, how He doesn't want the hurt and the shame and the
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:13.000]   regret and failure to dominate your thinking and your vision.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.080]   If you're here with family and friends and you want someone to pray for you, just invite
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.720]   them to pray for you in a moment.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.600]   Just reach out and say, "Hey, would you pray for me?
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.160]   That's an important word for me today.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.200]   I need to respond.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.360]   Would you just help me and pray?"
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.360]   And so whilst we're all being ministered to and prayed for in your own time when you're
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.280]   ready, you can then come forward to receive communion as a way of culminating perhaps
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.760]   what it is that the Spirit of God is doing in you.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.520]   We have about 15 minutes for this, so there's no need to rush.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.040]   So Lord Jesus, I pray for each person here.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.640]   If you'd like to receive this prayer, just open your hands as I pray.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.320]   Holy Spirit, Father, we're grateful.
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.600]   We're grateful that we're standing on the precipice of 2025, the most significant year
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.520]   of our lives.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:07.120]   We're thankful that you are a forward-moving God.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:15.080]   Father, we recognize that we carry hurt and disappointment, that regret and shame and
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:21.680]   failure are part of our story and sometimes are too much a part of our story.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:26.100]   Father, would you come?
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.720]   Would you minister to me right now in this place?
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:34.320]   Would you enable my spirit to say to you, "You are not done with me?
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.600]   Thank you, Lord, that you're not done with me.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.960]   Thank you that I have not disqualified myself.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:44.360]   Thank you, Lord, that I'm still on plan A. I may not have all the answers.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:48.400]   I may still struggle with the trauma of what it is I've been going through, but Lord, thank
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:54.400]   you that you forgive, redeem, renew, restore, that this will be my most significant year."
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:54:02.160]   So I'm just going to invite the elders and pastors to come and just be at the stations
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.160]   now.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.280]   But I want to invite you to take your time.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.680]   Pray with the person next to you if you want to pray.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.120]   Just receive more of the Holy Spirit if that's what you want.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.320]   Weep if you want to weep.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:23.280]   This is a safe place, and in a moment, when it's right, we'll respond together in worship.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:33.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
