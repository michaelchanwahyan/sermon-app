1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
 >> Amen. >> Amen.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,000
 >> Thank you, Jess.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 I think once a year I kick a football around,

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,440
 so considering that, it was a really good day, actually.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,200
 No injuries, it was really fun.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,040
 Well, a lot of times people ask you,

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,680
 how did you first become a pastor?

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,000
 When did you start your journey?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,600
 And so let me tell you a little bit about that.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,840
 I started my journey into full-time ministry

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,360
 as a youth pastor.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,640
 And back then I was serving the church I grew up in

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,720
 over in Kowloon Tong.

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,440
 I see Paco right there, actually.

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,680
 He was in my youth group.

16
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,800
 Oh, okay, well I'm talking about you, okay, Paco?

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,920
 Anyway, so I was the youth pastor for a little while,

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
 and youth work is a great way to get to know

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,520
 how to do ministry.

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,520
 And one of the things I got to do was to take youth groups

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,920
 on mission trips.

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,560
 And so this was about 17 years ago.

23
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,660
 I was just a kid back then, so I was like a big kid

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,560
 taking some little kids to a foreign country,

25
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,200
 a place I didn't know the language,

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,560
 I didn't know the people, to serve a group.

27
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,840
 I didn't even really know who I was connecting with.

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,080
 It's amazing that the parents allowed this all to happen

29
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,120
 in the first place, right?

30
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,200
 But it was a really good trip, actually, overall.

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,000
 But on the first night when we got there,

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,360
 we were looking for a place to have dinner.

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,840
 Okay, actually, we were on Hainan Island.

34
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,120
 This is when I discovered that Hainanese chicken rice

35
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,520
 is not really from Hainan Island, okay?

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,920
 Amongst many other things.

37
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,560
 So we were looking for a place to have dinner.

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,520
 I was walking around with me and a bunch of about 12

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,960
 other kids, teenagers, preteens, and so we found this place.

40
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,600
 It was a cheap hot pot place, so I thought, perfect.

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,600
 Hong Kong kids, cheap hot pot, perfect place for dinner.

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,800
 And so we decided to have dinner there.

43
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,440
 And when we walked in, we discovered, actually,

44
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,080
 it's a all-you-can-eat place.

45
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,200
 So yeah, we loved that.

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,080
 But how it worked was you get one visit to the buffet table,

47
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,400
 you get as much food as you want,

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,120
 and you can bring it back to the table,

49
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,360
 and that was your dinner.

50
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,700
 Okay, so we were all there having a good time

51
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,680
 and eating away, and there was one kid, though,

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,480
 who got way too much food.

53
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,800
 Like, it was just like a ridiculous amount of food.

54
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,720
 Now, do you remember back in the day,

55
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,740
 or back when I was growing up, Pizza Hut, right,

56
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,900
 had the salad bar, right?

57
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,240
 Oh, Pizza Hut salad bar, right?

58
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,560
 Me going out for Pizza Hut was like, yes, you know,

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,280
 Saitan, you know, white people food, right?

60
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,440
 This is amazing, okay?

61
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,360
 But that salad bar, right, you got that really flimsy,

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,360
 brown, like, bamboo-ish sort of bowl, do you remember that?

63
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,880
 Right, and there was whole art to, like,

64
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,480
 building up the salad, right?

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,400
 So you put, like, the potatoes at the bottom

66
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,960
 to get, like, a foundation, right?

67
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,560
 Stick some cucumbers on the side

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,520
 so you could, like, widen the bowl a little bit, right?

69
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,720
 And people would come back,

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,780
 and it was, like, this huge tower of salad, right?

71
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,720
 But in the end, like, it just got wasted

72
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,640
 'cause it was disgusting.

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,360
 It was like Thousand Island sauce over, like,

74
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,520
 pineapples and raisins and, like,

75
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,800
 all this random stuff mashed together.

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
 It was disgusting.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
 No one actually liked the salad,

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,200
 and I think they just liked seeing how tall

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,600
 they could make that tower, right,

80
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,360
 and bringing it back to the table.

81
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,740
 Well, that's kind of what happened, right?

82
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,540
 This kid got all this food, right?

83
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,680
 There was so much, so much food that he got.

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,640
 He couldn't finish it all.

85
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,800
 All right, so I got really upset.

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
 I was like, what are we gonna do, right?

87
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,880
 You've wasted all this food.

88
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,120
 But then I also thought to myself,

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,040
 okay, there's a teachable moment here, all right?

90
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,000
 How am I gonna make this into a life lesson, right?

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,840
 So it's a true story.

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,680
 This is what I did, right?

93
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
 I told the young guy, he's like,

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,200
 dude, like, what happened?

95
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
 You just wasted all this food.

96
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,480
 And he said to me, yeah, I thought

97
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,920
 it was all you can eat, Ellison.

98
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
 So, well, yeah, all you can eat

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
 doesn't mean all you can waste, okay?

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,600
 So, like, what are we gonna do about this?

101
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,800
 You know, you didn't eat the food.

102
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,840
 You're gonna have to pay for it now.

103
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,080
 And he starts to panic.

104
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,840
 He's like, well, I didn't do anything wrong, right?

105
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,880
 You said it was all you can eat.

106
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,120
 I'm just gonna put the food back.

107
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,840
 He's like, dude, that's disgusting, okay?

108
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,740
 Do not put the food back, okay?

109
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,960
 It's at the table now.

110
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
 All right, something's gotta happen.

111
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,260
 And he said, what's gonna happen?

112
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,840
 So, I told him, okay, well, the manager's gonna come.

113
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,720
 He's gonna weigh all the food.

114
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,140
 And according to how much it weighs,

115
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,840
 you're gonna have to pay the penalty

116
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,160
 for wasting all this food.

117
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,640
 And then he really starts to panic.

118
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
 So, well, how much money are you gonna have to pay?

119
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
 Like, my mom didn't give me that much pocket money.

120
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,400
 You know, I've been planning to spend on some souvenirs.

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
 Like, I don't have it.

122
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,440
 Like, what am I gonna do?

123
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,620
 So, I told him, okay, the only way you can get out of this

124
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,360
 is if you go to the manager

125
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,880
 and you beg him for forgiveness, okay?

126
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,240
 Beg him for forgiveness.

127
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,560
 Maybe he'll just let you go.

128
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
 He's panicking.

129
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,400
 Where is he?

130
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,760
 So, I point to a gentleman

131
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,040
 sitting on the other side of the restaurant.

132
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,920
 Okay, that's the manager sitting right there, right?

133
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,640
 Now, I've just pointed to a random guy

134
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,040
 minding his business, okay?

135
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,260
 He's there having dinner with his family, right?

136
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,960
 Because the truth was, there was no manager, okay?

137
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,240
 Who was mad at him.

138
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,140
 I just, like I said, teachable moment.

139
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,340
 I wanted to teach him a lesson to not to waste food.

140
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,980
 Right, so this boy, he stands there for a minute, right?

141
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,180
 And he's like sweating bullets.

142
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,500
 He's like rehearsing what he's gonna say,

143
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,340
 practicing his Mandarin.

144
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,300
 He's like, (mimics Mandarin)

145
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,900
 Right, and so, and then he really like,

146
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,660
 coyly walks up to this man, taps him on the shoulder,

147
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,900
 and he just starts going for it.

148
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,740
 I'm really sorry.

149
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,180
 I've ate all this food.

150
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,140
 I don't have money to pay.

151
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,420
 Please forgive me, right?

152
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,820
 And this man's just staring blankly at him like,

153
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,500
 why is this kid like confessing all his sins to me

154
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,840
 right now, you know?

155
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,820
 And then, anyway, I was standing in the corner

156
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,020
 also crying, but with laughter, right?

157
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,940
 Like, I'm not saying it was a good thing or a bad thing.

158
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,820
 I don't know, but no more food was wasted that trip.

159
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,900
 We'll say it like that, okay?

160
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,900
 So, now of course, you know, that's a bit of a funny story.

161
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,500
 But in a way, we sort of, we've all been there, right?

162
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,300
 In that moment.

163
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,740
 Like that moment when we realize we've done something wrong

164
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,820
 and the guilt and the shame and the fear

165
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,460
 that comes with that.

166
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,120
 And then you have this reaction of trying

167
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,020
 to make things right, realizing then,

168
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,580
 actually, there is nothing I can do to make it right.

169
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,540
 The only thing left for me to do is to ask for forgiveness

170
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,840
 and hope that forgiveness is offered to us.

171
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,020
 You know, we're at the tail end of the year already,

172
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,340
 believe it or not.

173
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,180
 And we have Advent starting soon.

174
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,120
 But before Advent, this is our last sermon series

175
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,380
 of the year.

176
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,380
 And actually, this sermon series was born out of a heart cry

177
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,340
 of the community, I believe.

178
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,420
 You may remember a few months ago,

179
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,860
 we did an event called Converse.

180
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,860
 And at Converse, we set up prayer stations

181
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,900
 up at a high school, you know, just up the hill.

182
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,840
 And there was a big hall and there was all these different,

183
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,340
 amazing prayer stations, different ways for us

184
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,980
 to interact with prayer.

185
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,020
 And one of the stations was to do with forgiveness, right?

186
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,540
 It was either asking, you know, prayer requests

187
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,380
 to give forgiveness or to receive forgiveness.

188
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,540
 And as we looked through the prayer requests

189
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,100
 that were written out, we realized, right,

190
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,100
 this is a theme that so many of us are struggling with

191
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,420
 in our community.

192
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,300
 Many of these had to do with relationships, right?

193
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,060
 People asking for the strength to be able to forgive people

194
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,700
 that have hurt them in different ways.

195
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,360
 There were also many voices asking for forgiveness

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,900
 because they have been the ones who have caused harm

197
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,320
 and hurt to other people.

198
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,140
 A lot of written on there was to, you know,

199
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,220
 about forgiving ourselves, right?

200
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,180
 The different things that we struggle with,

201
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,340
 asking God for forgiveness.

202
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,220
 And in some ways, there was also a lot of requests

203
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,700
 asking for, you know, to be able to forgive God, right?

204
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,900
 Because people have felt like God has let them down.

205
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,460
 They put their faith in God and they felt like God

206
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,300
 had let them down.

207
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,080
 And I feel like I need to forgive God in some way.

208
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,660
 And so since this was a topic that so many of us

209
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,120
 were wrestling with, we figured it was time

210
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,660
 to address this together as a church.

211
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,460
 Because the truth is, we all need, everyone needs

212
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,380
 to come to a good understanding of what forgiveness is,

213
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,260
 of what forgiveness is and what it's supposed to look like

214
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,380
 because forgiveness sits at the center of God's heart.

215
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,100
 And forgiveness is essential for our relationship with God.

216
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,020
 In fact, without forgiveness, there would be

217
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,180
 no relationship with God possible, right?

218
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,900
 At the same time, forgiveness is also essential

219
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,840
 for us to be in relationship and in community

220
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,000
 with each other.

221
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,800
 Without forgiveness, not even this church, right,

222
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,620
 society itself would totally break down

223
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,380
 and we would never be able to do life

224
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,300
 and to connect with each other.

225
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,640
 But at the same time, as we've experienced,

226
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,660
 it's not that simple.

227
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,080
 Right, because forgiveness is nuanced

228
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,880
 with so many different questions and feelings and emotions.

229
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,000
 And over these next few weeks, we're gonna face

230
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,680
 some of these questions head on.

231
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,440
 We're gonna be talking about some theological framework

232
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,440
 about what forgiveness is from the biblical perspective.

233
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,960
 We're gonna be looking at some very practical ways

234
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,140
 of how we can forgive, what forgiveness is

235
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,040
 and what forgiveness isn't.

236
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,600
 We're gonna hear testimonies from our community groups

237
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,420
 about how forgiveness has been such an enriching part

238
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,200
 of their relationship with each other.

239
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,880
 We're gonna talk about what it means

240
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,960
 for us to forgive ourselves.

241
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,560
 And in the end, the hope is we're gonna be equipped

242
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,400
 to be live out, to be walking out,

243
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,960
 to live a life that is defined by forgiveness.

244
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,720
 And so to start us on our journey today,

245
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,440
 I want to look at a passage that teaches us,

246
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,320
 you know, that I think really Jesus uses this passage

247
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,880
 to highlight just how important forgiveness is

248
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,060
 from his perspective and how he hopes

249
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,040
 his followers will respond to it.

250
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,440
 Okay, we're looking at Matthew chapter 18,

251
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,560
 verses 21 to 35.

252
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,760
 I'm gonna read it and you can follow along.

253
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,800
 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,

254
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,880
 "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister

255
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,480
 "who sins against me?

256
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,040
 "Up to seven times?"

257
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,940
 Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times,

258
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,820
 "but 77 times.

259
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,760
 "Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king

260
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,520
 "who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.

261
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,380
 "As he began the settlement, a man who owed him

262
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,860
 "10,000 bags of gold was brought to him.

263
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,500
 "Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered

264
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,020
 "that he and his wife and his children

265
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,080
 "and all that he had to be sold to repay the debt."

266
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,280
 Excuse me.

267
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,400
 "At this, the servant fell on his knees before him.

268
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,040
 "Be patient with me, he begged,

269
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,320
 "and I will pay back everything.

270
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,480
 "The servant's master took pity on him,

271
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,200
 "canceled the debt, and let him go.

272
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,380
 "But when that servant went out,

273
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,060
 "he found one of his fellow servants

274
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,740
 "who owed him 100 silver coins.

275
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,100
 "He grabbed him and began to choke him.

276
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,800
 "'Pay back what you owe me,' he demanded.

277
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,360
 "His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,

278
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,560
 "'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.'

279
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,820
 "But he refused.

280
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,340
 "Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison

281
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,820
 "until he could pay the debt.

282
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,100
 "When the other servants saw what had happened,

283
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,500
 "they were outraged and went to tell the master

284
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,380
 "everything that had happened.

285
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,600
 "The master then called the servant in.

286
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,140
 "'You wicked servant,' he said.

287
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,920
 "'I canceled all that debt of yours

288
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,380
 "'because you begged me to.

289
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,660
 "'Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant

290
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,180
 "'just as I had on you?'

291
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,260
 "In his anger, the master handed him over to the jailers

292
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,640
 "to be tortured until he should pay back all that he owed.

293
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,160
 "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you

294
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,160
 "unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."

295
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,820
 Challenging words.

296
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,940
 I think one of the reasons why it's challenging

297
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,980
 is because when we talk about forgiveness,

298
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,660
 initially, it's sort of like a counterproductive thing

299
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,580
 to do, we feel like.

300
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,420
 It feels foreign to our natural inclinations.

301
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,500
 It's unnatural.

302
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,740
 Maybe that's just me.

303
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,140
 But when we're hurt, when we're wronged,

304
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,140
 we don't want to forgive.

305
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,700
 What we want is revenge.

306
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,420
 What we want is revenge because we think revenge,

307
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,620
 getting this person back, is gonna make us feel better.

308
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,140
 On a micro level, this happens all the time,

309
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,300
 especially in Hong Kong.

310
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,420
 We Hong Kongers, super good at passive,

311
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,100
 aggressive forms of revenge.

312
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,780
 You go into MTR, someone steps on the back of your shoe.

313
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,140
 So in the end, you find them down in the MTR

314
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,860
 and then you bump them with your bag

315
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,820
 just so you can get them back from stepping on your shoes.

316
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,740
 Yes, feels so good to do that.

317
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,360
 Don't ride the MTR with me.

318
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,860
 But what happens, that's just a silly, trivial thing.

319
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,560
 What happens, though, when the stakes are a bit higher?

320
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,620
 What kind of revenge goes through your mind

321
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,440
 when you think about maybe the person

322
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,060
 who's caused you really hurtful wounds?

323
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,680
 They've hurt you in almost a devastating kind of way.

324
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,560
 How do you pay back the friend who stabbed you in the back,

325
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
 who betrayed you?

326
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,760
 What about the spouse or the partner that cheats on you?

327
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,640
 The business partner who runs off with all your money?

328
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,720
 A parent who abused you?

329
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,620
 A person who assaulted you?

330
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,440
 A boss or a coworker who humiliates you?

331
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,760
 How do we react in those kind of situations?

332
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,800
 I think revenge is the sort of mentality

333
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
 that Peter is bringing here before Jesus.

334
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,240
 When he asked the question, Lord,

335
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,780
 how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister

336
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,400
 who sins against me?

337
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,920
 Up to seven times.

338
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,120
 It's such typical Peter behavior in the Bible

339
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,440
 and I love how accurate and how honest the Bible is

340
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,800
 when it comes to the flaws of the disciples.

341
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,880
 So close yet so far.

342
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,360
 He seems to understand, yes, okay,

343
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,220
 maybe forgiveness is kind of necessary,

344
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,840
 but maybe it should also have a limit.

345
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,080
 And so when Peter says up to seven times,

346
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,240
 from his perspective, this is going above and beyond

347
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,480
 what he was supposed to do.

348
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,760
 In Jewish culture, seven is the perfect number.

349
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,920
 So by Peter saying seven, Peter is saying,

350
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,720
 yes, seven, if seven is surely more than enough.

351
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,560
 After I've forgiven seven times,

352
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
 after I've done God's will,

353
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,720
 I should be able to take the situation

354
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,040
 into my own hands, right?

355
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,180
 Or maybe you can look at it like this.

356
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,160
 I had an uncle who told me one time that,

357
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,560
 you know what, Ellison,

358
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,880
 Jesus only says you have to turn the cheek one time.

359
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,120
 If you turn the cheek and he hits you again,

360
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,920
 you have permission to slap the snot out of that person.

361
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,360
 [congregation laughing]

362
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,200
 That's not true, by the way, okay?

363
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,800
 But that's sort of like the vibe,

364
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,640
 the energy that Peter is bringing into his question.

365
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,580
 And honestly, if we were honest with ourselves

366
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,200
 or when I'm honest with myself,

367
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,120
 I wish sometimes that's the answer that Jesus gave,

368
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,200
 permission to fight back.

369
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,040
 He would have said something like,

370
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,400
 yes, you know what, seven times,

371
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,100
 that's more than enough, Peter.

372
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,440
 On the eighth time, throw hands, do what you want to do.

373
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,600
 But he doesn't.

374
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,160
 Instead, his response is a deep challenge to his followers

375
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,220
 on how we are supposed to forgive.

376
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,080
 Jesus answered, I tell you not seven times,

377
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,060
 but 77 times.

378
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,280
 Now again, it's not a formula, right?

379
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,440
 Jesus is not saying on the 78th time,

380
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,840
 you can do something about it yourself.

381
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,320
 What Jesus means here is that there is no limit.

382
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,040
 There is not supposed to be a limit

383
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,120
 to the number of times you should offer forgiveness.

384
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,560
 In other words, if you really want to do God's will,

385
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,840
 don't even think about counting, just forgive.

386
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,860
 Now that, my friends, is a hard pill to swallow.

387
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,960
 Because it sounds like we're just supposed to be helpless.

388
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,600
 Right, it almost sounds like forgiveness is cheapened, right?

389
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,840
 It sounds as though Jesus is giving permission

390
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
 for people just to walk all over us,

391
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,560
 do whatever they want to hurt us,

392
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,600
 and there's not a single thing we can do about it.

393
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,120
 All we have to do is just keep forgiving

394
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,480
 and forgiving and forgiving.

395
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,240
 But what if, and I'm sure many of this people room have,

396
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,720
 and many people listening have,

397
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,280
 what if we've been hurt in the most horrible of ways?

398
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,160
 Does God just expect me to let it go and to forget about it?

399
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,600
 Is this what it means to forgive?

400
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,360
 Because if so, it doesn't sound like it's very healthy

401
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,520
 for us, right?

402
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,440
 It doesn't sound healthy for us to live life that way,

403
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,080
 for the community to practice forgiveness that way.

404
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,880
 This is not what Jesus means.

405
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,680
 And so he tries to explain this with a parable a little bit

406
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,120
 to illustrate the point.

407
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,920
 And he says it like this.

408
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,240
 This is the story.

409
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,160
 Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king

410
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,000
 who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.

411
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,240
 As he began the settlement, a man who owed him

412
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,600
 10,000 bags of gold was brought to him.

413
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,240
 Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered

414
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,320
 that he and his wife and his children

415
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,040
 and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.

416
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,160
 Now this is that word debt.

417
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,880
 Debt is such a scary word, right?

418
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,080
 The word itself almost sounds heavy, right?

419
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,960
 You know what I mean?

420
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,280
 It's a sort of word that can fill with dread

421
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,120
 and panic and anxiety.

422
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,840
 Right, in my context, it's kind of sad.

423
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840
 The only letters and phone calls I have these days

424
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,440
 is either people telling them, right, I owe the money, right?

425
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,040
 So like the credit card bill comes in

426
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,760
 or the electricity bill comes in,

427
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,840
 school fees, taxes, overdue live-in charges,

428
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
 all that kind of stuff, right?

429
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,440
 So it's I owe you money.

430
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,600
 You're in debt to me, Ellison, in this, right?

431
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,960
 Or it's invitations to get into even more debt, right?

432
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,840
 Say hi, you know, it's like, you know,

433
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,320
 you're in trouble, typhoon, blah, blah, blah,

434
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,960
 all that kind of stuff, all those phone calls

435
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,080
 that you get, okay?

436
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,920
 Do you need to borrow money?

437
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,760
 Do you speak Chinese?

438
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,580
 Do you speak English?

439
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,240
 Okay, those kind of calls.

440
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,600
 So debt is scary.

441
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,720
 The scary thing about debt is because it carries

442
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,000
 with it consequences.

443
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,840
 When you don't pay back your debt,

444
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,160
 there are consequences to your actions.

445
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,400
 And this is what we see happening

446
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,180
 in this opening scene of this story.

447
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,580
 We're told that this man, right,

448
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,080
 is in an unbelievable amount of debt.

449
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,920
 10,000 bags of gold, right?

450
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,720
 This is a crazy, ridiculous amount of money, right?

451
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,240
 Some of the research I was doing, some of the commentaries,

452
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,220
 this would be the equivalent of billions

453
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,800
 or maybe even like a made-up number,

454
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,960
 like gazillions, okay, about of dollars.

455
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,800
 But Jesus was doing this on purpose, right?

456
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,120
 He purposely uses an exaggeration to make a point.

457
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,040
 A massive amount of money, there is no way in heaven

458
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,200
 or on earth that this guy will ever able

459
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,400
 to pay back this amount.

460
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,920
 Not even if he lives a million lifetimes

461
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,200
 would he be able to pay back this amount of money.

462
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,080
 And so it spells out the consequence.

463
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,880
 The consequence would be that he would have

464
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,600
 to sell himself, his wife, and his children,

465
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,920
 and everything that he owed to repay the debt.

466
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,600
 Now, I think in order for us to truly understand

467
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,620
 forgiveness from God's heart,

468
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,620
 we have to imagine ourselves in this situation a little bit.

469
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,820
 Because the truth is, like this man who was caught up

470
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,360
 in debt to the king, to his master,

471
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,400
 we are also in debt.

472
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,400
 But our debt is owed to the king of kings, to God himself.

473
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,920
 And we are in debt to God because of our sin.

474
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,420
 Every single person is.

475
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,920
 Scripture tells us, "All have sinned

476
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,400
 "and fallen short of the glory of God."

477
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,320
 And Scripture also tells us, "The reality is,

478
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,320
 "the wages, the debt, the consequences of sin is death."

479
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,240
 Now, this is an idea we're gonna unpack

480
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,080
 a bit more clarity next week.

481
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,260
 But essentially, it means that every one of us,

482
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,360
 no matter who we are, we have all sinned against God.

483
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,040
 And because we have sinned against God,

484
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,220
 we owe him an insurmountable amount of debt

485
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,080
 that we will never, ever, ever be able to pay back.

486
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,840
 And because of this debt, God indeed has the right

487
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,160
 to demand everything from us, including our lives.

488
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,720
 Now, if the story ended here,

489
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,720
 it would be a bit sad, but justifiable, right?

490
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,560
 We owe this.

491
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,960
 This is the situation without fail,

492
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,840
 every single person is in.

493
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,560
 But the good news, the gospel is that

494
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,840
 this isn't where the story ends.

495
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,400
 Right, and so Jesus tries to illustrate this

496
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,160
 in the way the master responds to his servant.

497
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,840
 At this, the servant fell on his knees before him.

498
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,560
 "Be patient with me," he begged,

499
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,140
 "and I will pay everything back."

500
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,240
 The servant's master took pity on him,

501
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,600
 "Cancel the debt and let him go."

502
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,360
 This man realizes, right, his inevitable doom.

503
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,160
 And he tries to do everything in his own power.

504
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,800
 He falls to his knees, he begs for surrender,

505
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,560
 he asks for patience and mercy.

506
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,600
 He literally begs, "I'm gonna pay you back."

507
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,940
 He makes promises that he cannot keep.

508
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,480
 It's almost like a pathetic and hopeless pleading.

509
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,960
 But remember, right, there is no way,

510
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,260
 this man knows there's no way he can pay back

511
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,400
 the gazillion dollars he owes his master.

512
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,380
 And I found that sometimes that's the kind of situation

513
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,840
 we find ourselves in too.

514
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,820
 When we realize our sin, when we realize

515
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,200
 how much in debt we are to God because of our sin,

516
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,580
 we end up promising God this and that, right?

517
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,820
 "I'm gonna be better, I'm gonna fix myself,

518
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,120
 "I'm gonna try and be better.

519
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,500
 "I'm never gonna do that again,

520
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,940
 "I'm never gonna do this again."

521
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,940
 But what I found in my life is that the more I try,

522
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,820
 even though I try and I try and try,

523
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,360
 the harder I try, it's almost like the harder we fail.

524
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,200
 And I've slowly come to the realization

525
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,260
 that through our own power, through our own will,

526
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,580
 we will never, ever, ever, ever be able

527
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,160
 to pay back the debt of sin.

528
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:51,780
 And the master realizes this, and God realizes this.

529
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,520
 And even though he has the right and authority

530
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,500
 to divide some sort of payment,

531
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,160
 something really beautiful happens.

532
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,980
 This phrase, "The servant's master took pity on him."

533
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,700
 The word pity here means like love actually and compassion.

534
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,180
 Not because the servant has done anything

535
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,180
 to deserve a pardon, but because of the master's heart

536
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,980
 of love and compassion, the debt is canceled

537
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,640
 and he is set free.

538
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,920
 And considering the amount of debt he was owed,

539
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,800
 this was unimaginable, right?

540
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,160
 The listeners of Jesus's time listening to this,

541
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
 were like, "This guy must be crazy

542
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,080
 "to just let all that money go."

543
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,080
 But this is the master saying, "What matters to me

544
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,640
 "is not the amount of money that he owes.

545
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,440
 "I'm trying to demonstrate my heart of grace,

546
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,460
 "of mercy, of compassion, and of love."

547
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,820
 And the servant walks away in freedom.

548
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,680
 And this is Jesus reminding us, right?

549
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,920
 This is an echo of God's message of forgiveness of sin.

550
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,700
 Actually, this is a message that God has said

551
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,240
 time and time and time again.

552
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,200
 We see God's heart to forgive.

553
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,160
 Throughout the Old Testament even, Isaiah 43, 25,

554
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,440
 "I will blot out your transgressions."

555
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,740
 Jeremiah 31, 34, "I will forgive their wickedness

556
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,100
 "and remember their sins no more."

557
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,200
 Psalm 103, 12, one of my favorite passages,

558
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,720
 "As as far the east is from the west,

559
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,720
 "so far has he removed our transgressions from us."

560
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,720
 This is our starting point, church.

561
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,180
 Never forget this.

562
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:37,200
 God's heart is one that is inclined towards forgiveness.

563
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,720
 His heart is one of compassion and of love.

564
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,600
 This is what we were singing over and over and over again

565
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,720
 this morning, right?

566
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,000
 His heart is that despite the fact that we have wronged him,

567
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,520
 we have disappointed him, we have sinned in our lives,

568
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,640
 we have missed the mark, we have gone against his will,

569
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,640
 despite that many times we make a mess of things,

570
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,600
 God still looks on us with love and compassion, amen?

571
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,640
 And God loved us so much,

572
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,760
 he gave us his most precious gift, his son,

573
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,800
 as the only way to repay the debt of sin.

574
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,360
 God gave us his son, paying the debt of our sins

575
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,040
 so that we can have relationship with him.

576
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,240
 Again, this is something we're gonna talk more about

577
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,060
 next week and in the weeks to come.

578
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,000
 But what we need to understand for today is this,

579
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,440
 is we who worship the true God are a people

580
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,120
 who have had all their debt forgiven

581
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,000
 because our master loves us.

582
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,560
 Forgiveness, therefore, is important

583
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,280
 because it's the key not just to this life,

584
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,720
 but to eternal life as well.

585
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,440
 This is what I mean when I say forgiveness

586
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,080
 sits at the very heart of God

587
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,440
 and encapsulates all that he came to do,

588
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,280
 was to offer forgiveness for you, for me,

589
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,560
 for anyone who asks of it.

590
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,640
 If you are a follower of Jesus in this room today,

591
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,520
 you are free because you have received God's forgiveness.

592
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,720
 Now, as a people who've understood

593
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,080
 and experienced this wonderful gift of forgiveness,

594
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,400
 you would think that we would now want to share

595
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,360
 this gift with others as well,

596
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,160
 like last week when we were talking about the gospel.

597
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,600
 But again, it's hard and it's complicated.

598
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,880
 It doesn't always work this way.

599
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,360
 And for the servant on this story,

600
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,640
 we find that though, even though he is the one

601
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,040
 who has experienced the forgiveness of a great debt,

602
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,360
 his own heart remains unchanged.

603
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,360
 It tells us this, but when that servant went out,

604
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,180
 he found one of his fellow servants

605
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,400
 who owed him 100 silver coins.

606
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,480
 He grabbed him and began to choke him.

607
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,360
 "Pay back what you owe me," he demanded.

608
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,440
 His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,

609
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,280
 "Be patient with me and I will pay it back."

610
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,800
 But he refused.

611
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,080
 Instead, he went off and had that man thrown in prison

612
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,760
 until he could pay the debt.

613
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,680
 You see, when this man encounters someone who owes him money,

614
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,160
 his heart is not full of compassion.

615
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,140
 He remains tight-fisted and stingy about what he's owed.

616
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,980
 100 silver coins, okay, I said just now,

617
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,220
 you know that 10,000 bags of gold was like a gazillion

618
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,460
 dollars, 100 silver coins would have been about maybe

619
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,700
 the equivalent of four months wages, right,

620
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,120
 the Bible scholars say.

621
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,160
 Not a small sum in and of itself, right,

622
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,100
 but not insurmountable as well, right?

623
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,000
 But compared to what he owed, right,

624
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,580
 completely insignificant.

625
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,880
 And this dialogue that he has, right,

626
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,240
 it's almost an exact replica of what just happened with him

627
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,720
 and his master, right, there's a debt,

628
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,960
 there's a falling to the knees,

629
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,600
 begging for patience and mercy.

630
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,360
 But like I said, the difference is that there's no mention

631
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,720
 of compassion from this servant's heart.

632
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,000
 Instead, it's the opposite.

633
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,920
 Listen to this term, he said he refused.

634
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,040
 When it says refused, this word means to sort of like

635
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,720
 harden his heart, right?

636
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,340
 He made a conscious decision in his mind,

637
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,260
 I am not willing, I'm going to make a choice

638
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,040
 not to forgive this person.

639
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,100
 And actually, it gets even worse.

640
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,940
 Not only does he refuse, but he tries to take actions

641
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,660
 into his own hands, right?

642
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,380
 He escalates, he purposely, first of all,

643
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,300
 goes out of his way to seek out this person who owes him.

644
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,700
 And when he finds him, it says he physically abuses him,

645
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,020
 right, he grabs him and he chokes him.

646
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,220
 He takes matters into his own hands.

647
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,660
 As you read this story, you probably, as I was,

648
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,340
 judging this guy right now, right?

649
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,380
 Wow, how evil, how wicked is this man

650
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,920
 that he would do something like this?

651
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,100
 Now, before we get too judgmental of this servant,

652
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,220
 and as uncomfortable as this might make us,

653
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,420
 maybe we need to lean into this part of the story

654
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,780
 a little bit.

655
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,700
 And I found it helpful, instead of judging it

656
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,380
 from the outside, to use this scenario more like a mirror

657
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,260
 to check my own attitude toward forgiveness.

658
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,660
 And maybe it's a bit more like this servant

659
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,700
 than we think it is.

660
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,940
 Because like I said just now, when we've been sinned against

661
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,540
 our first reaction is more likely inclined towards revenge.

662
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,940
 We want to see people suffer, right,

663
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,080
 and get what they deserve when they sin against us.

664
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,580
 I admit to you in my own heart, this is often what I feel.

665
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,980
 I want to be able to enjoy all of God's forgiveness.

666
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,660
 Yes, I want to be able to come to God,

667
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,040
 ask for his forgiveness, and receive his compassion

668
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,020
 and mercy and grace.

669
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,180
 But sometimes when people sin against me,

670
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,740
 my first reaction is not, Father, forgive them.

671
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,880
 My reaction is, I hope they suffer.

672
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,820
 I hope God punished them for what they did to me.

673
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,660
 In fact, I hope they first, they experience 10 times worse

674
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,720
 than what they did to me.

675
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,140
 That's what they deserve.

676
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,860
 I know I'm not alone in this.

677
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,340
 But this is precisely why this whole series

678
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,820
 and this conversation on forgiveness is important

679
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,820
 for us to have together.

680
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,180
 Because now Jesus starts to talk about the consequences

681
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,440
 of our debt when we don't forgive.

682
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,960
 Jesus needs to be saying, unless you learn to forgive

683
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,940
 that you have been forgiven, there are gonna be

684
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,640
 consequences, and these consequences affect both

685
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,960
 the wider community, but also your own relationship

686
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,760
 with God as well.

687
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,640
 Let me tell you how it leaves a strain

688
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,520
 on the community, first of all.

689
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,600
 When the other servants saw what had happened,

690
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,600
 they were outraged and went and told their master

691
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,080
 everything that has happened, that had happened.

692
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,480
 All right, this is why I said this is a heart cry

693
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,320
 of the church.

694
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,700
 This is why I said we're gonna take this journey together

695
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,680
 as a community, as a body of Christ,

696
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,140
 as a family of brothers and sisters.

697
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,040
 Because often when we talk about forgiveness,

698
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,700
 we tend to look at it individualistically.

699
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,820
 That's just between two people.

700
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,980
 It doesn't concern the rest of the community.

701
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,140
 So let's say me and Derek here had beef.

702
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,880
 We had a problem with each other.

703
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,340
 If people find out, just leave the Eric,

704
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,240
 Ellison and Derek can figure that out by themselves,

705
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,800
 it doesn't concern us.

706
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,160
 But actually it does.

707
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,300
 I think as a body of Christ, we all need to agree

708
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,240
 that forgiveness is a poison.

709
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,360
 And that if we don't deal with it,

710
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,200
 there is no way we can ever be the body of Christ

711
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,740
 that he has called us to be.

712
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,660
 How are we supposed to walk alongside each other

713
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,520
 if we're not willing to forgive?

714
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,720
 How are we supposed to grow in intimacy

715
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,720
 if we hold grudges against each other?

716
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,460
 How are we gonna encourage each other

717
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,500
 if we keep account of what's right and what's wrong?

718
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,780
 Every time we've wronged and right,

719
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,620
 we keep an account of the rights and wrongs.

720
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,460
 Therefore, as a community, we need to be aware of this.

721
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,620
 And as a community, if we see unforgiveness taking place,

722
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,900
 we need to do something about it

723
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,500
 so it doesn't corrupt the rest of the body of Christ.

724
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,000
 We need to call it out.

725
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,860
 What also points out is the community then,

726
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,880
 it's supposed to be a place of safety

727
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,520
 and of accountability.

728
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,060
 You see, if no one else had got involved,

729
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,740
 the servant would have got away with his actions.

730
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,860
 He would have got away with abusing his debtor,

731
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,420
 having him thrown in jail,

732
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,880
 punished for something like that.

733
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,360
 But notice, it was the other servants

734
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,820
 who called him out of his sin.

735
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,100
 Right, it was the other servants,

736
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,380
 the community around him that flagged to the master,

737
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,060
 hey, something isn't quite right here.

738
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,800
 And we need to do and say something about it.

739
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,820
 So when it comes to forgiveness,

740
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,580
 we see forgiveness and justice is something

741
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,700
 that actually go hand in hand with each other.

742
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,260
 Forgiveness doesn't mean that one's causing harm,

743
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,720
 can just get away with it.

744
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,620
 But forgiveness is what happens when a community,

745
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,500
 when somebody is wrong and the community around you

746
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,220
 comes around you to support you,

747
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,140
 to give you strength and power to confront the wrong

748
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,140
 and it's voiced out.

749
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,000
 You see what I'm saying?

750
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,540
 Community and forgiveness doesn't mean saying

751
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,820
 it really didn't happen, right?

752
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,660
 It really doesn't matter, just let it go.

753
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,820
 Right, in either of those cases,

754
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,680
 if it didn't matter, you just let it go,

755
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,480
 you don't need forgiveness.

756
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,980
 Right, maybe it's just a misunderstanding

757
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,120
 that needs to be cleared up.

758
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,860
 But forgiveness is the process when we admit,

759
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,940
 yes, something did happen, it did matter,

760
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,700
 something has gone wrong and we need to deal with it.

761
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,260
 And we deal with it together as a body of Christ.

762
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,740
 But the way we deal with it is to hand it over to God,

763
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,540
 to say we're not God.

764
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,180
 We don't get to set the standard of who is worthy

765
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,220
 of forgiveness or who is not.

766
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,460
 We simply offer forgiveness first.

767
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,980
 Because without that, we will never be able to move on

768
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,520
 as individuals and as a community.

769
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,120
 So that's how it affects us together as a body of Christ.

770
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,120
 On the same time though, it has an individual impact

771
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,060
 on us as well.

772
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,440
 And God spells out very clearly the results

773
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,180
 of withholding forgiveness.

774
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,860
 Then the master called the servant in.

775
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,180
 You wicked servant, he said.

776
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:42,140
 I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.

777
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,820
 Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant

778
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,180
 just as I had on you?

779
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,660
 In his anger, the master handed him over to the jailers

780
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,940
 to be tortured until he should pay back all that he owed.

781
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,900
 This is how my heavenly father will treat each of you

782
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,780
 unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.

783
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,280
 Again, this sounds harsh.

784
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,460
 But I think the point scripture is trying to make is this.

785
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,700
 It might seem like when we don't offer forgiveness,

786
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,820
 that we hold onto the power, that we hold onto the control.

787
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,900
 But when in reality, what Jesus is saying is

788
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,320
 when we withhold forgiveness,

789
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,080
 it's actually a great detriment to us.

790
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:28,280
 It seems like the other person is getting what they deserve.

791
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,900
 But in reality, what we're doing is condemning ourselves.

792
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,700
 You might know the old saying,

793
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,940
 unforgiveness is like drinking a poison

794
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,900
 and expecting the other person to die.

795
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,580
 Right, so it has really, really serious consequences

796
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,940
 for ourselves if we withhold forgiveness.

797
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,780
 Maybe you could think about it this way.

798
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,460
 We're gonna do a little exercise together.

799
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,720
 Okay, on the count of three,

800
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,660
 I want everybody to take a deep breath.

801
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,420
 Okay, when you take a deep breath,

802
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,700
 hold it in for as long as you can.

803
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,940
 Right, try and hold your breath, okay?

804
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,700
 One, two, three.

805
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,980
 [inhales]

806
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:23,340
 Some of us might be able to do this for longer, right?

807
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,500
 But you're probably feeling a struggle to breathe now, right?

808
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,260
 To breathe out that breath.

809
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,420
 Right, none of us, nobody in this room

810
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,880
 is able to hold their breath forever.

811
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,900
 You would either pass out

812
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,500
 or if you really did just stop breathing altogether,

813
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,380
 you would die.

814
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,820
 In order for you to take your next breath,

815
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,840
 you have to release the breath you're holding.

816
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,380
 And so it is with forgiveness.

817
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,860
 If we want to receive forgiveness,

818
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,660
 we need to be able to release forgiveness to others as well.

819
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:04,540
 Like I said, though, this is the starting point.

820
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,300
 Right, this is just the introduction to this journey.

821
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,100
 And there's no way we can unpack and discover

822
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,340
 all the things that forgiveness means for us

823
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,440
 in one short sermon on a Sunday morning.

824
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,380
 So I want to encourage everybody here.

825
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,220
 Please try to come along, right,

826
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,660
 to the next few messages that we have,

827
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,300
 to the next few Sundays that we have

828
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,100
 in this journey of forgiveness.

829
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,160
 And this is not about, you know,

830
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,780
 like maintaining numbers at the vine

831
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,620
 or anything like that, right?

832
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,780
 It's not about that.

833
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,180
 But what this is, it's for your wholeness.

834
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,860
 It's for your understanding.

835
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,100
 It's for you to really be able to embrace

836
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,540
 what forgiveness means so you can walk

837
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,520
 in the freedom of forgiveness.

838
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,820
 After all, Jesus taught us to pray.

839
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,620
 Forgive our sins as we forgive those

840
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,800
 who have sinned against us.

841
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,580
 And my heart is, as individuals,

842
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,980
 but also as a community, we will embrace

843
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,420
 this journey of forgiveness together.

844
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,060
 To step by step, learn what it means

845
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:15,340
 to receive and to give out what forgiveness

846
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,080
 really means in God's heart.

847
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,340
 This is how we build, continue the kingdom of God

848
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,580
 here on this earth.

849
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,400
 So would you pray with me as we start this journey together?

850
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,660
 [coughing]

851
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:45,200
 Jesus, we know that this is an issue

852
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,960
 that many of us are wrestling with.

853
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,080
 And even if we're not wrestling with it

854
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,400
 right at this moment, there is gonna come a time

855
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,320
 where we've been wronged and we need to offer forgiveness.

856
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,080
 Or someone wrongs us, or we wrong someone else

857
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,340
 and we need to be forgiven.

858
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:09,400
 And so Lord, I thank you that.

859
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,560
 Our starting point, Lord, is that you have already

860
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,240
 poured forgiveness out for us.

861
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,120
 That you have offered forgiveness to us

862
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,620
 despite our sin, despite the ways that we've missed

863
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,200
 the mark when it comes to being in relationship

864
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,040
 with you, Lord.

865
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,760
 You've given us everything we need,

866
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,820
 your most precious gift so that we can have forgiveness.

867
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,800
 Lord, as we receive this gift, Lord,

868
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,940
 we hear that you've also asked us to pour it out

869
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,580
 to those who have wronged us.

870
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:50,480
 And I know this is a hard journey for some of us to take.

871
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,220
 You might be thinking right now,

872
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,040
 if you only knew the pain that I've been through,

873
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,380
 what this person did to me, how that person hurt me.

874
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:12,020
 And Father, we know that you meet us

875
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,440
 in those areas of pain.

876
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:21,120
 And so Jesus, I pray that through your gentle guidance

877
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,900
 in the way that only you know how you would teach us

878
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,700
 how to forgive.

879
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,580
 That as we embrace forgiveness in our own hearts,

880
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,180
 it would soften our hearts.

881
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:44,740
 And as we learn to live a life defined by forgiveness,

882
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,880
 we will reflect your gospel, your grace,

883
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,420
 your mercy to everybody.

884
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,820
 And that even together as a community,

885
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,460
 we can keep encouraging each other in this journey,

886
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,580
 keep encouraging each other to not keep things hidden,

887
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,060
 but to bring it out into the light when there's been sin,

888
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,620
 when there's been wrong in the community.

889
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,620
 We will not let that just be swept under the carpet.

890
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,640
 But Lord, because we know the proper way

891
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,020
 to deal with these things, we can walk with it together.

892
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,020
 And that this forgiveness that we offer to each other

893
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,720
 reflects, truly reflects the heart that you have for us.

894
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,380
 So Lord, be with us the next few weeks

895
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,100
 as we walk through this.

896
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,200
 Encourage us, strengthen us, guide us.

897
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,540
 We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

898
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,120
 (gentle music)
