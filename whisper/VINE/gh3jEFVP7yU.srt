1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020
 As you sit down, say hi to the person sitting next to you.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,520
 Say hi.

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,560
 Nice to see you.

4
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,880
 Wow.

5
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,440
 It's great to be here.

6
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,720
 Oh my goodness.

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,800
 Well, welcome to The Vine.

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,520
 If you're relatively new, my name's Andrew.

9
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,560
 I'm one of the pastors here.

10
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,200
 So glad you're here.

11
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,320
 If you're watching us online, if you're joining us for the first time online or regularly,

12
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,360
 we're glad that you're a part of our church online experience.

13
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,280
 It's great to have you here.

14
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,200
 Who's enjoyed the Psalm 23 series so far?

15
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,200
 People enjoying that one?

16
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,600
 Yeah.

17
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,000
 Awesome.

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,320
 Great.

19
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
 Great.

20
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,640
 Good.

21
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
 That'll stop today.

22
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
 It stops today.

23
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:40,840
 Because today, we enter into verse 5 of Psalm 23, the most challenging and the most critical

24
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,880
 of the verses of the Psalm.

25
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,280
 In fact, in verse 5 of Psalm 23, David changes everything.

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,600
 And he changes everything because he has something so important to say to God's people if they

27
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,800
 want to be a non-anxious presence in the chaos of this world.

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,760
 And he changes the imagery in verse 5 from a shepherd imagery that verses 1 to 4 has

29
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,320
 been kind of obsessed with to a completely new imagery, that of a king.

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,720
 And not just a king, but a king who has a table and is hosting people at the table.

31
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,080
 Now this is completely different from the idea of God being a shepherd, kind of a lowly,

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,240
 meek shepherd who's leading his sheep in green pastures and quiet waters, restoring our souls.

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,360
 And even when we go through dark valleys, his presence is with us.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,360
 And all that imagery has been kind of calm and gentle and challenging, but welcoming.

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,200
 And we want God to be our shepherd.

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,400
 But now he flips it and says, "We're going to go from this meek and humble image to a

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,840
 powerful image, the image of God as a king."

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,040
 And not just a king, but a king who provides lavish generosity on his people, who gives

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,760
 oil to his people, anoints them, and wants them to experience the greatest part of life,

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:08,240
 who takes the cup, a wine, the wine of his grace and his goodness, and it's like free

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,560
 flow, not for 90 minutes for brunch on a Saturday, but like your cup overflows, free flow for

42
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,240
 life, for eternity.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,520
 And David does this because he has something critical to say.

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,200
 He wants to change the imagery to sort of jar you, maybe out of a slight slumberness

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,280
 into the soberness that if you don't grasp a hold of this one particular issue, you can

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,280
 never be a non-anxious presence amid the chaos of this world.

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,360
 In fact, the issue David's about to speak about is the issue that causes the most anxiety

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,860
 for us.

49
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,960
 The most fear-inducing issue is the one that he now turns to.

50
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,400
 And it's like he's saying, "We cannot go further unless we soberly realize that unless

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,080
 we're doing something about this issue in our lives, there's no chance.

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,320
 Even if we know that God is our shepherd, there's still no chance that we'll find ourselves

53
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,520
 in such deep peace that people will want to follow Jesus."

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:19,440
 In fact, if the church gets this issue wrong, it has the power to repel people from Jesus

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,200
 rather than draw them in.

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
 What is the issue?

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,120
 Well, let me introduce it to you by reading you Psalm 23, verse 5.

58
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,560
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,560
 You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
 On the surface, this is an amazing verse.

61
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,320
 I mean, I wonder if you can just soak for a moment in the kingly imagery.

62
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,720
 You prepare a table for me.

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,680
 And this table is a place of abundance and generosity.

64
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,280
 It's a table that symbolizes a blessing.

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
 God pouring his oil out on me.

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,200
 It's a table of joy, a table of restoration, a table of life abundant.

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,760
 It's a table of safety and security and peace.

68
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,880
 And David is saying, "God provides this table for us, and we think this is the most amazing

69
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
 thing."

70
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,280
 And then we read, "In the presence of my enemies."

71
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,920
 And we think for ourselves, "That doesn't sound like a table of joy and abundance."

72
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,560
 In the presence of my enemies?

73
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,400
 I mean, if I was writing this verse, and I wanted to communicate to you joy and abundance

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,640
 and generosity, and how God just does that for us, here's what I would say.

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:45,080
 You prepare a table before me in the place where you've extinguished all my enemies.

76
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
 Now that's joyful.

77
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,560
 I mean, stop for a moment and think about a world where you do not have any enemies.

78
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,700
 Can you imagine what it would feel like to be in a place where no one hated you?

79
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,960
 No one disliked you?

80
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,200
 No one said anything about you behind your back?

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,100
 You had no social media trolls, Ellison.

82
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,400
 Could you imagine that?

83
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,640
 Could you imagine it, Ellison?

84
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,040
 Where no one says anything bad about you online?

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,440
 No one ever does anything harm to you.

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,640
 You live a peaceful, free life.

87
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,000
 Now that sounds like joy.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 That sounds like abundance and generosity, but David did not write that.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,840
 Or maybe David could have said it like this, "You prepare a table before me in your presence,

90
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
 O Lord."

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
 Oh, yes!

92
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,120
 Now that would be joy.

93
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,160
 Could you imagine if you had a table in the presence of God?

94
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,360
 Imagine if you had a table where you sat one side and God sat the other side, and you just

95
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,040
 spent your life feasting with the free flow of His grace.

96
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,480
 I mean, how amazing would it be if no one else was around other than you and God?

97
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,040
 That intimacy we just talked about, the holy ground that we all long for, it would be like

98
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,460
 that 24/7.

99
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,720
 Could you imagine the joy and the abundance in that?

100
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,360
 If I was to try to communicate to you joy, I would say, "It's a table in God's presence."

101
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,600
 But David doesn't write that.

102
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:16,080
 David writes, "This table is in the presence of your enemies, the ones you hate, the ones

103
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,680
 who hate you, the ones who can't stand you, the ones who want to tear you apart, the ones

104
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,480
 who want to pull you down, smear your reputation, make everything bad possible about you, the

105
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,960
 ones who would like to end your life.

106
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,840
 It's that table.

107
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,560
 You have those people in your life.

108
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,480
 God has prepared a table for you before those people."

109
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,520
 And David is trying to twist this imagery and make it seem strange.

110
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,400
 Generosity, joy, oil flowing, this free flow of God's love and grace, and yet the presence

111
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,680
 of my enemies, what does this all mean?

112
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,480
 And David's designing it so that you would ask one simple question, "Why?

113
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,960
 Why do I have this table?

114
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,760
 What is this table actually for?

115
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,000
 What does this mean?

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,600
 Why is David saying this?"

117
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,360
 Well, there's a traditional answer to that question.

118
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,760
 And the traditional answer has been loved and celebrated for so many years, hundreds

119
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,440
 and hundreds of years.

120
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,640
 In the traditional answer to the "Why?" about David's verse, the traditional answer will

121
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
 tell you this.

122
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,680
 It will say, "Here's what it's about.

123
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,160
 David is picking up on Old Testament imagery, and it's beautiful imagery, the imagery of

124
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,800
 Israel and their enemies.

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,240
 In fact, if you read the Old Testament, you'll see that Israel constantly was surrounded

126
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
 by enemies.

127
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,320
 They were almost constantly at war with the people around them.

128
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,400
 There was always this battle going on.

129
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,040
 And if you look through the Psalms, and if you look through the Old Testament prophets,

130
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,080
 you'll see time and time again passages of, "We are victorious over our enemies," passages

131
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,640
 of, "Lord, smite our enemies," passages about pulling down the enemies, sending them to

132
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,200
 the pits of hell so God's chosen people can live a glorious life.

133
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,920
 To the traditional point of view, the perspective of it, it's like this.

134
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:14,840
 God prepares a table for me in the presence of my enemies.

135
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,560
 The idea is that we are having a constant party in the presence of all the people that

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
 we hate.

137
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
 Could you imagine what that would be like?

138
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,040
 That would be awesome.

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,840
 I mean, that's a table I want to go to, right?

140
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,240
 Wouldn't it be amazing?

141
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
 I mean, think about this.

142
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,860
 I have a very long list of people that I don't like.

143
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,200
 Maybe you also have a long list of people you don't like.

144
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,760
 I also have a long list of people who don't like me, people who don't like the vine.

145
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,640
 I think the vine is a bad church, that we preach heresy here, that this is not a good

146
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,040
 place to be.

147
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,920
 I've had social media stuff said about me, rumors spread about me.

148
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,400
 I mean, I've got people I could list that keep me up at night that I really struggle

149
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
 to love.

150
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,160
 Could you imagine if God surrounded this table with those people and he gave me a cup of

151
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,760
 his blessing and poured his oil on me and I could sit there and go, "Ha, ha, ha!

152
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
 Look how I turned out!"

153
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,080
 I mean, come on, that sounds amazing.

154
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,840
 Doesn't that sound amazing?

155
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:27,120
 It sounds amazing, but it doesn't sound very Christian.

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
 And that's a little bit of a problem if you're a Christian here in this room or online right

157
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,800
 now, because kind of we want that traditional interpretation because it would feel great

158
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,920
 to like gloat in front of our enemies.

159
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,800
 But the imagery doesn't sit well with us, does it?

160
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,360
 And it doesn't sit well with us for some very good reasons, because I don't know if that's

161
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,280
 quite the table God has provided for us.

162
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,600
 In fact, if you look at Jesus and his teachings, you'll get a sense of this.

163
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,400
 This is Jesus teaching in Matthew 5, starting in verse 43, Sermon on the Mount, most important

164
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,040
 thing Jesus does right at the beginning of his ministry, wanting people to understand

165
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,320
 why he's come, what he's going to do, the type of kingdom he's inviting people into.

166
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
 Listen to this.

167
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,480
 "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbors and hate your enemies.'"

168
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
 Ha, ha!

169
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,160
 "Gloat over your enemies."

170
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,200
 But I tell you this, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you

171
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,560
 may be sons of your Father or sons and daughters of your Father in heaven.

172
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,720
 He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good.

173
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,080
 Notice this, Jesus talking here.

174
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,320
 He's going to make great things happen for the evil people and the good people.

175
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,340
 And he sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

176
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,040
 If you love those who love you, what kind of reward do you get?

177
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,640
 What kind of reward is that?

178
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,200
 Are not even the tax collectors doing that?

179
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,780
 And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what are you doing that's more than others?

180
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,320
 Don't even the pagans do that?

181
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
 No.

182
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,480
 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

183
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,680
 I mean this is amazing to me.

184
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,400
 Jesus is basically standing before Psalm 23, 5 in the traditional way that it's understood,

185
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,280
 and he's saying that is not it at all.

186
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,360
 In fact, here's what Jesus does, and if you forgive the pun, he turns the table over.

187
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,840
 And he basically says, "You want to know how to live in my kingdom?

188
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,240
 You want to know what life is like with me?

189
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,840
 It's not a joy of lying down and drinking my cup and gloating in front of your enemies.

190
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,840
 I want you to love your enemies.

191
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,000
 I want you to approach your enemies.

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,200
 I want you to be in communion with your enemies.

193
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,480
 I want you to experience the greatest thing that you could ever experience, and that is

194
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,920
 communion with the very people who want to tear you apart.

195
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,880
 I want that for you," Jesus is saying.

196
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,480
 I love the way that Eugene Peterson, who wrote the message translation of Scripture, he put

197
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
 it on verse 48.

198
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
 Let me read this to you.

199
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,080
 He says, "In a word, what I'm saying is this.

200
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,480
 Grow up.

201
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,000
 Your kingdom subjects.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,640
 Now live like it.

203
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,600
 Live out of your God-created identity.

204
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,040
 Live generously and graciously towards others the way God lives towards you."

205
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,800
 Oh, I prefer the traditional approach.

206
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,280
 How about you?

207
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,880
 Live graciously and generously towards those who may not be gracious or generous towards

208
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,320
 you.

209
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,360
 Notice that Jesus is not saying, "Live generously with people who live generously with you.

210
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,640
 Be nice to the people who are nice with you."

211
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,440
 He's saying, "Be gracious and generous with all people."

212
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
 Why?

213
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,120
 Because of their reaction, not because of how they treat you, not because of their words,

214
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,640
 but because of how I treat you.

215
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,200
 I'm treating you with grace.

216
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,760
 I'm treating you with love.

217
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,040
 I'm empowering you, so I'm doing that.

218
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,640
 The way I work with you, I want you to work with others.

219
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,680
 He doesn't say, "Only with the people who are nice."

220
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,480
 He's inviting us into a new journey.

221
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,000
 How do we then understand Psalm 23, verse 5?

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,800
 I want to put it to you today that actually I think the traditional interpretation is

223
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,400
 completely wrong, and there's an original interpretation, one that actually I think

224
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,640
 David was thinking about as he wrote this, an interpretation that when you see the language

225
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:30,280
 of verse 5, you'll come to see is far more in line with Jesus than you may have first

226
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
 thought.

227
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,760
 Have a look again in Psalm 23, verse 5.

228
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,120
 It says, "You prepare a table before me."

229
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
 Very important.

230
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,080
 David says, "You provide a table before me."

231
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,520
 The idea of a table being before him is the, it's actually the Hebrew word, "lefanai."

232
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,440
 And lefanai pitches the idea that a table is created before.

233
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,080
 Lefanai means in front of.

234
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,040
 And what's interesting about that Hebrew word is it's a word that doesn't carry with it

235
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,400
 any ownership or claim.

236
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,860
 In other words, David's saying, "This is not my table."

237
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,720
 This is not David's table.

238
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,040
 It is not my table.

239
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
 It is not your table.

240
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
 It is lefanai.

241
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,760
 It is prepared before you, in front of you, but it is not yours.

242
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:24,000
 Because if David had said, "Oh, you prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies,"

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,520
 what he would have been saying is basically like the traditional approach.

244
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
 The table's for me.

245
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,280
 It is not for my enemies.

246
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,760
 My enemies have to stand around and suffer watching me gloat and enjoy myself.

247
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,360
 The table is for me.

248
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
 Are you following?

249
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,440
 He doesn't say that.

250
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,040
 David specifically says, "It's a table that I do not own.

251
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,080
 It is not a table that has my name on it.

252
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,300
 It is a table that is before me, in front of me.

253
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,800
 And because it's in front of me, there's an invitation."

254
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,560
 In other words, actually, lefanai, the Hebrew word, actually has a welcome and an invitation

255
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,780
 to it.

256
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,760
 It's basically God saying, "You are surrounded by your enemies.

257
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,240
 I've provided a table for you.

258
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
 Will you have a seat, David?

259
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,480
 Will you sit down at my table, in the presence of your enemies?"

260
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,880
 What even blows my mind even more is that he then uses another word for this.

261
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,680
 He says, "In the presence of my enemies."

262
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
 "In the presence" is the Hebrew word neged.

263
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
 Neged means confrontation.

264
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,240
 It means against or opposite.

265
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,000
 What the word means is that there are two parties, two individuals or two groups that

266
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,440
 are at war with each other.

267
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,440
 So when David says, "You prepare a table before me in the neged of my enemies," David's including

268
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,240
 himself in that strife, in that tension, in the war that's happening.

269
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,340
 That's really important.

270
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,900
 This is not about David going, "I'm perfect and my enemies suck."

271
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,480
 This is David going, "There is a war going on.

272
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
 I feel passionately as well.

273
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
 I've been hurt.

274
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
 I know I've hurt.

275
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,160
 There's stuff happening here."

276
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,880
 And it's like God shows up and he takes the two warring parties and he pushes them aside

277
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,680
 and he places a table before them, in between them, if you will.

278
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,600
 And not only, and this is the powerful thing, not only is God opening up the table for David,

279
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
 he's also saying, "It's in the presence of your enemies."

280
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 In other words, it's their table too.

281
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,200
 And if it's their table, then God is also opening up an invitation for your enemies

282
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
 to sit down.

283
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,200
 Oh, that's not so nice.

284
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,840
 What was supposed to be a lovely meal has now turned into tension in the air.

285
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,280
 I could cut the tension with a knife.

286
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:49,480
 It wasn't quite the plan that I had to begin with.

287
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,240
 God is saying, "We get to sit down at a table and have a meal with our enemies."

288
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,640
 The Hebrew word for meal, which is not in this passage, is the word shuel.

289
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,600
 And shuel is a derivative word from another word that is in this passage, and that's the

290
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,140
 word table.

291
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,160
 Table is shulkan.

292
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,120
 Shulkan is the place we come to to have a shuel, a meal with someone.

293
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,060
 Now shulkan, although it's translated here table and it means table, it was also used

294
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:23,120
 metaphorically in the Old Testament for an act of reconciliation.

295
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,440
 The table, the shulkan, was a place where a shulkan could take place.

296
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,000
 In fact, an act of reconciliation at a table had another Hebrew word.

297
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,420
 It's the word socha.

298
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:42,540
 So I have a shulkan that enables me to have a shuel with someone, a meal, so that we can

299
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,200
 socha together.

300
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,680
 We can reconcile.

301
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,300
 We can deal with our differences.

302
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,020
 We can change our attitudes.

303
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,860
 We can talk about the stuff that we wouldn't normally talk about.

304
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,080
 We'd take that big elephant in the corner of the room and we'd sacrifice it and we'd

305
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,280
 eat it together as we shuel together on the shulkan so that we can have a socha.

306
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,280
 Are you with me?

307
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:13,020
 Now this idea of a table being the place of reconciliation is throughout the Scriptures.

308
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,340
 In fact, in the New Testament, it becomes the predominant picture of what reconciliation

309
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,340
 is all about.

310
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,640
 I'll give you a couple of just quick examples.

311
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,300
 There's that amazing moment in Luke chapter 7 where the woman comes in whilst Jesus is

312
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
 at the table.

313
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,440
 By the way, a bit of a side note, Jesus basically throughout the Gospels is either on his way

314
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,620
 to a meal, at a meal, or leaving a meal.

315
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,620
 That's basically Jesus.

316
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,880
 He's just pigging out the whole time, right?

317
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,640
 And it's because of the shuel and the shulkan.

318
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,420
 So there's this woman who comes into Simon's house in Luke chapter 7 and sits down and

319
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,700
 actually comes behind Jesus who's at the table and she breaks open an alabaster jar of oil

320
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,600
 and pours it on his feet and she weeps and wipes his feet with her hair and it's a beautiful

321
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,500
 picture of her restoring herself, reconciling herself with the one that she believes is

322
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:10,220
 her Messiah, the Savior, and Jesus in front of everybody says, "Your sins are forgiven."

323
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,660
 Reconciliation with God.

324
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,660
 And then there's that amazing moment, isn't there, where Peter has denied Christ three

325
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,420
 times and he's taken off and he's gone back fishing and Jesus shows up in the resurrection

326
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:28,740
 and makes a barbecue and invites Peter for a shuel with him and they share fish together

327
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,440
 and during the meal they reconcile with one another and connect deeply together.

328
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,040
 And of course there's that moment in Acts chapter 2 where the church is establishing

329
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,180
 the rhythms of what church is going to look like and it says there that on every day they

330
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:51,780
 met together in each other's homes, they broke bread together with sincere and glad hearts.

331
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,500
 The Hebrew for sincere there means without any rocks.

332
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,700
 That's the literal translation.

333
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,820
 In other words, the early church practiced a daily practice of coming around the people

334
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,100
 in the community and having a meal together so they could talk about stuff and make sure

335
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,540
 no rocks were getting in between their relationship.

336
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:16,060
 They embraced Shulchan as part of their church community.

337
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:22,380
 And all of this culminates in the early church going, "Hang on, how do we create a symbol

338
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,860
 that will help the world to understand reconciliation?

339
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
 Let me think about it.

340
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,860
 Oh, I know.

341
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,460
 This is Paul, right?

342
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,700
 On the night that Jesus was betrayed, do you know what he did?

343
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,820
 He took bread and he took wine and he shared a meal with us and he said, "Do this in

344
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,980
 remembrance of me."

345
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,900
 And so the early church did this incredible thing.

346
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,620
 They started to gather around together and celebrate in the reality that the best symbol

347
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,140
 that there could be for reconciliation is a table and not just a table but a meal at

348
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,460
 the table and we've come to understand it as communion, that we take the bread and we

349
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,580
 take the wine and it's a way of us saying, "We are reconciled with God, that there's

350
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,260
 no longer any rocks between us and God, that he's poured out his spirit, poured out his

351
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,660
 love and we are now restored to the fullness of relationship with him and it's symbolized

352
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,660
 by a meal."

353
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,280
 And here's the powerful thing.

354
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,740
 When you think about communion, you're not sitting on this side of the table.

355
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,860
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

356
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,780
 When you think about communion, you're sitting on this side of the table because you're the

357
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,260
 enemy that's been invited to the table.

358
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,760
 You're the one who was at odds against God.

359
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,000
 In fact, Paul, writing in Romans chapter 5 verse 8, said it this way, "God demonstrates

360
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,860
 his love for us in this, that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us, whilst

361
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,940
 we were enemies of God, whilst we were still separate from him, a long way from him, God

362
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,300
 came and offered reconciliation to us.

363
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,500
 He took the first move.

364
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,760
 Christ died for us whilst we were still sinners, whilst we were his enemies.

365
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,400
 He could have sat at the table and gloated with his angels at how bad humanity was, but

366
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,660
 instead he prepared a table, he invited us to come and sit, he broke the bread, he spilled

367
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,420
 his blood, he did it on the cross of Calvary so we would know shulchan with God."

368
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,820
 Are you with me?

369
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,100
 And what this all is suggesting is if God has invited us to his table and if he has

370
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,500
 shulchaned with us so we could have reconciliation with him, how can we then hold that back from

371
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,060
 others?

372
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:38,120
 How can we then stand on the other side, grab the chalice and gloat at our enemies?

373
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:45,860
 Could it be that actually David was right in line with Christ and was saying the table

374
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:57,380
 is set before us in the presence of our enemies so that we might know love, community?

375
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:02,440
 So that all that anxiety and stress that we hold in our hearts and our lives could be

376
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,260
 dealt with right here at the table.

377
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,180
 I love this idea because I want you to see how David then speaks of the reality of what

378
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,200
 a community could be like if it actually shulchaned with one another.

379
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,340
 He says this, he says, "Oh, you anoint my head with oil."

380
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:27,220
 It's like when I no longer have enmity with other people, when I actually sit down and

381
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,060
 reconcile with the people that have been against me, when I feel that connection, when we actually

382
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,980
 deal with some of our issues where we forgive one another, it's a little bit like God pours

383
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
 his...

384
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
 I'm not going to do it, don't worry.

385
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
 I'm not going to do it.

386
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,620
 But God's going to pour his oil on my head and I'll have this anointing and it'll be

387
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,340
 like a blessing and we'll both be anointed together, which is really interesting because

388
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,300
 if you jump a little bit forward to Psalm 133 verses 1 and 2, listen to what it says,

389
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,740
 how good and pleasant it is when brothers and sisters, when people live together in

390
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
 unity.

391
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,020
 You want to know what it's like?

392
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,020
 It's like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on

393
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,100
 Aaron's beard, down on the collar of his robes.

394
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,660
 It is not this posture.

395
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:18,340
 It is this posture.

396
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,500
 And that posture is like an anointing that pours over our heads and runs down our robes

397
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,220
 and we're filled with the anointing of God.

398
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,580
 Back in Psalm 23, then it says, "My cup overflows, the free flow forever."

399
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,580
 Why?

400
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,380
 Because there's no enmity here.

401
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,260
 Remember when I said earlier in my message, could you imagine what it would be like to

402
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,800
 have no enemies?

403
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,020
 When Jesus challenges the church and He says, "You should love your enemies," He's inviting

404
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,580
 you into that world.

405
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,100
 He's inviting you into the place where you actually don't have enemies, where actually

406
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
 you can be free.

407
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,500
 Because I want you to know this, the place of greatest stress and anxiety, the place

408
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,620
 that's going to make you more of an anxious person in the chaos of this world is when

409
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,140
 you don't deal with the friction that you've got in relationships with others.

410
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,140
 Your brokenness in your relationship with others will be the number one stress-inducing

411
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,860
 thing in your life.

412
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,860
 It will tear you apart.

413
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,060
 I know every single one of us in this room, we know what it's like to have division with

414
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,820
 people.

415
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,260
 Some of you in this room, that division is with your family members.

416
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,780
 In the last three years here in Hong Kong and all the political stuff that's happened

417
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:33,780
 has torn you apart in your relationships with your mothers and your fathers and your families.

418
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,140
 Some of you in here, you know what that's like with your spouse right now.

419
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,340
 You're in enmity with the one that you were originally brought together with, with such

420
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,460
 love and such grace.

421
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,660
 Yet right now the reality is you know what it feels like to be against one another.

422
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,700
 Some of you, it might be a colleague at work, it might be some sort of relationship in your

423
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
 life.

424
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,420
 We all know that feeling, don't we?

425
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,820
 That anxiety and stress that is there.

426
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:03,780
 It is so hard for us to find a place of peace when we are at enmity with people.

427
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:08,460
 And God has prepared a table before us and before them.

428
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,620
 And He said, "Will you come and sit?"

429
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,140
 It's going to take courage from you.

430
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,220
 It's going to take a huge amount of grace in you.

431
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,060
 It's going to take you having the ability, this is where it gets hard, you having the

432
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:29,580
 ability to go, "I was also wrong, that I actually made some mistakes too, that it's not all

433
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,580
 about you.

434
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,980
 It's also about me."

435
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:40,020
 It's going to take some of us actually being willing to ask for forgiveness.

436
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,740
 There's no more humbling thing to do in the world than that.

437
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:51,380
 And it's going to take some of us braving the pain that the enemy has caused in us,

438
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,380
 braving the hurt that sits there.

439
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,940
 And by saying that we are to love our enemies, God is not saying, "Just continue to be abused

440
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,820
 by your enemy."

441
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,980
 He's not saying even, "You have to like everything the enemy does."

442
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,660
 He's not saying, "You have to accept all the stuff that the enemy has done to you."

443
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,100
 He's saying, "You have to love them."

444
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,380
 And how does love most gloriously get portrayed in life?

445
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:26,260
 Through the cross, through the laying down of our pride and our humility.

446
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:33,300
 And it's picking up our cross and following after Christ and saying, "Love means to say

447
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,540
 that the same God who forgave me can also forgive them.

448
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:42,540
 And if the same God can forgive them, how can I not forgive them?"

449
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,900
 It's not easy, is it?

450
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:50,980
 And David says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."

451
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:59,100
 We'd love to gloat, but actually we have to submit.

452
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,980
 How do we do this?

453
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,540
 Let me give you some practical ways as I close.

454
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,060
 Has this been helpful for some of you so far?

455
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:11,300
 Let me give you some practical ways that you this week can start a shulkan with someone

456
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,020
 that you might need to shulkan with.

457
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,900
 Here's the first thing.

458
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,780
 You have to embrace Jesus' perspective that the concept of an enemy is never permanent.

459
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,180
 The concept of an enemy is never permanent.

460
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,260
 The idea of an enemy is always temporary in God's eyes because God has the ability and

461
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,180
 the power and the grace to change an enemy to a friend.

462
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,580
 And if our starting point is, "There's no way this is ever going to happen.

463
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,100
 There's no way they're ever going to like me again.

464
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,660
 There's no way that this is ever thing.

465
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,100
 They're going to be my enemy forever."

466
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,340
 Then we're in the wrong starting point.

467
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,740
 We're not starting point from the perspective of Jesus.

468
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,380
 We're starting from the perspective of ourselves.

469
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,500
 So we have to believe that enemy states are temporary and that actually God has the ability

470
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,540
 to change everything in the power of His name.

471
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,980
 That's the first thing.

472
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
 Here's the second thing.

473
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,060
 We have to realize that if we want to be reconciled with others, we have to first be reconciled

474
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,380
 with God.

475
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,300
 Our starting point is reconciliation with God.

476
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:15,740
 In fact, not just that, but our ability to feel the reconciliation of God will directly

477
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,900
 be our ability to offer that reconciliation with others.

478
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,260
 The more that we have been forgiven, the more that we are able to forgive.

479
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,020
 He who has been forgiven much is able to forgive a lot.

480
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,620
 He that's been loved a lot is able to love a lot.

481
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,740
 Those that have been forgiven little, forgive little.

482
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,420
 This whole thing is in our Scriptures.

483
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,220
 Jesus speaks about this a lot.

484
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,700
 And so your ability to understand the reconciliation of God, to feel that power yourself, will

485
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,580
 be directly your power to be able to then pass that on.

486
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,580
 And that's great news for some of you in this room if you're not a Christian, if you're

487
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,100
 watching online right now and you're not a Christian.

488
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,300
 There's a table set before you where God invites you to come into a new relationship with Him.

489
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,440
 He doesn't see you as an enemy.

490
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,940
 He sees you as a friend already.

491
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,780
 Whilst you were still distant from Him, He died for you as we saw in that Scripture earlier.

492
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,140
 He invites you to the table of reconciliation and love so that you would know His forgiveness

493
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,020
 and His power.

494
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:11,180
 But this verse or this part here is not just for non-Christians in this room.

495
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,580
 It's also for you as Christians.

496
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,180
 It's challenging you that you need to have short accounts with God.

497
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,340
 That actually your job is to walk in His grace and forgiveness, to come to the table regularly,

498
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,780
 both as we take communion in church, the blood and the bread that symbolizes that, but in

499
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:31,060
 your own prayer life, regularly coming before the Lord and saying, "Would you forgive me,

500
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
 Lord?

501
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
 I screwed up again in this.

502
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
 I said this here.

503
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,060
 I did this here.

504
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,060
 I did that.

505
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
 I did what I did.

506
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,780
 I'm coming into that repentive discipline that I have to be able to be reconciled with

507
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,900
 you so that I can then offer reconciliation to others."

508
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
 Here's the third thing.

509
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,060
 You have to always embrace your own brokenness.

510
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,980
 You have to be willing to accept that you are also wrong.

511
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,980
 Reconciliation at the table is not, "Hey, buddy, would you come and join me for the

512
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
 table?

513
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,680
 I want you to come and have a meal with me because I want to spend 45 minutes telling

514
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,700
 you how bad you are."

515
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,500
 Like who would enjoy that meal, right?

516
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
 Maybe you would.

517
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
 I don't know.

518
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
 But that's not the idea.

519
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,060
 The idea is this table is not prepared so I can spend the whole time telling you how

520
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,340
 bad you are and how much you've hurt me.

521
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,740
 The table is prepared so that I would realize that I am a contributing factor.

522
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,980
 Remember, two people at enmity with one another and God moves them apart and places the table

523
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,980
 there.

524
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,720
 Our first posture as we sit down is, "I've made mistakes too.

525
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,020
 I've screwed up in this relationship as well.

526
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,460
 I didn't do it all right either."

527
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,260
 And yeah, you hurt me and there were things you did that really hurt me and I want to

528
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,060
 be honest about that and we're going to talk about that.

529
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,620
 But my starting point is I've also contributed to this mess and I want to just admit that

530
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,820
 before you and ask for your forgiveness.

531
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,140
 It's powerful.

532
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,140
 Notice this.

533
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,500
 Here's the fourth thing.

534
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,140
 Forgiveness is an event but reconciliation is a process.

535
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
 It's a process.

536
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,460
 You know, it's interesting in Scripture, Jesus said this.

537
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,620
 He said basically, "Forgiveness is a command."

538
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,420
 Jesus commands us to forgive.

539
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,140
 He says it so strongly that He says, "If you don't forgive, then I will not forgive you."

540
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,540
 That's strong.

541
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,300
 So forgiveness is a command of God.

542
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,340
 Now, the reason why it's a command is because it's something you can do just yourself.

543
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,340
 You are able to just forgive because you don't need a third party or somebody else to be

544
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
 involved in that.

545
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,420
 The choice is on you.

546
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,020
 When God commands you to forgive, whether that person ever says sorry, whether that

547
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,620
 person ever acts better, whether that person ever does more nice things for you or not,

548
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,020
 even if they continue to abuse you, continue to criticize you, continue to pull you down,

549
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,020
 it does not matter.

550
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,780
 The command is still for you to find a place in your life to forgive them.

551
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,580
 So forgiveness is an event.

552
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,580
 It's a command.

553
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,580
 It's something we do.

554
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,660
 Reconciliation though, Paul writes this.

555
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,660
 He says it's a ministry.

556
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,580
 It's not a command, a ministry because it takes two people.

557
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,300
 No longer are you solely responsible.

558
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,100
 You're solely responsible for the forgiveness in your heart, but you can't be solely responsible

559
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,060
 for reconciliation around a table.

560
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,480
 That involves another's free choice.

561
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,740
 You may end up sitting at the table and they never take their seat.

562
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,380
 We have to recognize that reconciliation is a process that we go through.

563
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,620
 And sometimes it takes a lot longer than we might like.

564
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,860
 It's not always that one meal and suddenly it's rainbows and My Little Ponies.

565
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,740
 It takes hard work sometimes.

566
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,480
 It takes time to allow the conversations to be what they are.

567
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,660
 Some of you just need to allow yourself to be in a process.

568
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,740
 Maybe stop kind of putting that expectation on yourself that it needs to be fixed by now

569
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,500
 and recognize you're in a process.

570
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,420
 And as long as both of you are working into that process, then you can believe that restoration

571
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,900
 and reconciliation can come.

572
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,060
 And here's the last thing.

573
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,980
 Do it over a meal.

574
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,460
 Literally do it over a meal.

575
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,900
 There's something quite powerful in the reality of sitting down for an hour and a half with

576
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,860
 someone, having some unhurried time and inviting them to a meal and having a conversation with

577
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,560
 them about the things that you haven't been able to have a conversation with.

578
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,060
 The reason why it's great around a table is because you can't run away.

579
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,080
 Well, you can, but generally people don't run away, right?

580
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,500
 It's over food, so there's usually other talk and conversation.

581
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,140
 There's an enjoyment together.

582
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,460
 And yet then there's that open space for that conversation to happen.

583
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,060
 I want to challenge you, invite you to invite somebody out for a meal this week that you

584
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,660
 need to show calm with.

585
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:25,380
 I'm a bit nervous saying that because I might get a lot of invitations this week for dinner.

586
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:33,140
 Who is it that God might be asking you today to invite to a meal so that you can sit down

587
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,980
 and not gloat at them for 45 minutes, but actually do what this passage encourages us

588
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,940
 to do and reconcile?

589
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:46,260
 Could you imagine a Hong Kong where there were no enemies?

590
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,140
 Could you imagine your family where divisions are restored?

591
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:57,620
 Could you imagine your workplace where it's a place of family and community and life and

592
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,800
 not draining every moment of your life?

593
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,700
 Could you imagine what it would feel like for you if you were able to be a non-anxious

594
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,820
 presence in the chaos of this world?

595
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:13,100
 And the only way that will happen is if you embrace the table.

596
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,260
 The Holy Spirit is basically saying to you today, "I've set a table before you in the

597
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,620
 presence of your enemies, and your head could be anointed with oil.

598
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,420
 Your cup could overflow.

599
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,220
 You could be that non-anxious presence in a chaotic world.

600
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,620
 The question is, will you sit down?"

601
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,660
 Can we pray together?

602
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,220
 Let's pray.

603
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:44,900
 Holy Spirit, we're grateful for your presence, grateful for the holy ground that you prepared

604
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,220
 for us today, and we're grateful for this topic that's not easy.

605
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,100
 And Lord, I want to pray now over every person here.

606
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:01,300
 Lord, each one of us has broken relationships in our lives.

607
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:10,140
 Each one of us has areas in our lives where we have enemies, people that we've hurt, people

608
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,460
 that have hurt us.

609
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:19,860
 Each one of us knows what it's like to carry the stress of relationships that are in turmoil.

610
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:26,380
 And just like last week, you don't promise the immediate end to all of those things.

611
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:34,860
 But what you're offering us today is a sobering thing, that because you have reconciled with

612
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:43,340
 us who were once your enemies, you now are empowering us in the kingdom to offer reconciliation

613
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,860
 to those around us.

614
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:56,940
 And Lord, there is nothing that is more liberating than us being at peace with those that we

615
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,700
 were once at enmity with.

616
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,220
 Holy Spirit, I want to pray, Lord.

617
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,540
 I love the fact that in this verse, David says, "It's like oil flowing over me.

618
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,020
 It's like my cup never is dry.

619
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,500
 That's what it feels like when I'm reconciled with my enemies," David is saying.

620
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,500
 It's like this constant place of blessing.

621
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,100
 It's like the world is just as it should be.

622
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:23,460
 It's like my fear and my anxiety has been stripped apart from me, and I'm finding myself

623
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,980
 back in that relationship again.

624
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,180
 There's shalom.

625
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
 There's peace.

626
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,180
 There's grace.

627
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
 There's love.

628
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,860
 And my cup overflows.

629
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,580
 David wants you to experience that kind of life.

630
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,460
 Jesus wants you to experience that kind of life.

631
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,500
 That's why he said to you, "Love your enemy."

632
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:54,500
 That's why he said to you, "There is possible to have a world free from rocks, sincere hearts,

633
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:00,100
 holy ground, intimacy with God and with others, so we might be a non-anxious presence in the

634
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,020
 chaos of this world."

635
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,420
 Holy Spirit, I pray for courage.

636
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,700
 In fact, I wonder whether you'd just stand with me for a second.

637
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,420
 I want to pray one final thing as we just finish our time, as we go back into worship.

638
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,100
 But I feel to pray this over you as you stand.

639
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,540
 If this is an important word for you this morning, would you just, whether you're online

640
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,940
 as well, just open your hands.

641
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,900
 I want to pray what we prayed right at the start of this message.

642
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,620
 Lord for the people here standing before you with their hands open, I pray.

643
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,620
 Holy Spirit, would you come.

644
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:39,180
 Father, would you enable them to be strong and courageous in this area of their life.

645
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,180
 Lord I want to pray.

646
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,660
 Lord, every single one of us have different personalities.

647
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,460
 For some of us, we love to run into conflict.

648
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,220
 For some of us, we run as far away from conflict as possible.

649
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:53,340
 Holy Spirit, I pray for the Spirit-infused courage that is needed right now, for the

650
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,060
 conversations that lie ahead of these people this week.

651
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,780
 I want to pray for boldness and courage and grace to sit down with people that they have

652
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,700
 long not sat down with, maybe ignored or avoided.

653
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,780
 Lord, I pray that you would give them the right words, Lord.

654
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:15,140
 I want to ask for grace to be in those conversations, a grace that fills our lips so that our starting

655
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:20,380
 point is I'm a contributor to this too, and I don't want to walk around with this burden

656
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,380
 anymore.

657
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,540
 I don't want to walk around with this anxiety anymore.

658
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,180
 I want us to reach out, and I don't know if this is something you're going to respond

659
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:32,980
 to or not, but I just need to say this, that I forgive you, I forgive myself, and let's

660
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,300
 try to make something work here together.

661
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,220
 Lord, I pray for the courage for that conversation.

662
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,020
 I pray for the grace that will be needed in the words of that conversation, and I pray

663
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:52,020
 for the humility, and I also pray for a releasing of the anointing and the blessing that those

664
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,420
 conversations create.

665
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,860
 You have set before us a table in the presence of our enemies.

666
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,940
 Lord, may our heads overflow with oil.

667
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:14,300
 May our cup constantly be spilling out as we experience the beauty of your forgiveness

668
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,340
 and our forgiveness with others.

669
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,420
 May we stay in this place of just receiving from Him as we close our time with a little

670
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,180
 bit more worship together.

671
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,680
 Thank you.

672
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,680
