[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900]   Father, we're just so grateful, grateful that we gather on Sunday here in Hong Kong and
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.860]   lift up our hearts and our minds to you to sing these songs that speak of your goodness
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.540]   in your life, to hold forth the hope that is in us because of the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.740]   And Father, I want to thank you for each person here.
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.260]   Lord, I thank you that you have called them.
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.620]   Thank you, Lord, that no one is in this room or online right now by mistake.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.260]   And Father, I want to pray that as we celebrate Easter together, that your spirit would descend
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.260]   upon us.
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.780]   Father, we're thankful that in the word Paul would say that the same spirit that raised
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.580]   Jesus from the dead is now in us.
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:49.380]   And Lord, I pray that as we open up this idea of you being in us and with us on Easter Sunday,
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.740]   that Father, you would come and just begin to speak and minister to each person.
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.780]   I pray that no one would leave here today without having felt a personal, a personal
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.060]   embrace from you.
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.540]   And I thank you, Lord, that you know each person here by name and you love them.
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.380]   You know their stories.
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.900]   You know what sits on their hearts.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.380]   You know their dreams.
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.380]   I pray that they would feel that in your resurrected power, you would come and speak to each one
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.380]   personally today.
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.140]   Father, we thank you for this in Jesus name.
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.140]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.660]   Hey, can we thank our band, our worship team?
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.660]   So grateful.
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.660]   Have a seat.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.660]   Have a seat.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.420]   Well, welcome to the Vine.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.420]   My name's Andrew.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.720]   If you're new to the Vine, we're so glad you're here.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.980]   Welcome on Easter Sunday.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.500]   And I am just so excited that you would be with us and that we get to celebrate together
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.260]   the beauty and the profundity of the fact that we worship a God who did not die, but
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.540]   was raised again.
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.380]   And you know, there's something very, very special in the fulfillment of a dream.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.060]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.020]   There's something very special about the fulfillment of a dream.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.860]   And in this room right now, as I look around, there are so many dreams that sit on our hearts.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.820]   For some of you in this room, those dreams are, you're already living them out.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.820]   You've already embraced them.
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.020]   You're already walking in them and you're finding great joy in your life as you live
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.020]   out your dreams.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.460]   For some of us in this room, perhaps those dreams have only just begun.
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.660]   Perhaps you've just started to take the first tentative steps in faith towards the dreams
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.620]   that you sense that God has put on your heart.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.660]   Perhaps for some of us in this room, we're still wondering what the dream is.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.940]   Perhaps we're still asking whether God has a dream for us, whether there is a purpose
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.940]   to your life.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.340]   And I want you to know that there is a dream that God holds in his heart for you, that
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.560]   he longs to impart into you so that you can live a life that you so long to have lived.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.420]   No matter how you might feel in the room today, we gathered together today on Easter Sunday
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.820]   to celebrate a long held dream that God had in his heart that now comes into its fruition
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.580]   on this day and is now celebrated in the lives of Christians all over the world.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:24.360]   And the dream is this, that life can actually overcome death.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:32.100]   Come on church, that life can actually overcome death.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.700]   In 2016, I was reminded of the power that there is in the fulfillment of a dream.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.540]   At the time I was actually in Israel and I was there with a film crew from the Vine here
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.380]   and we were filming a teaching series called the story of Jesus, which was a series on
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.020]   the gospel of Luke.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.660]   And we had traveled to Israel to film this series in all these different locations.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.980]   In fact, in our shooting production, we had 40 locations over 10 days of shooting.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.340]   40 locations all over Israel in just 10 days, which meant we had four locations every single
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.340]   day.
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.820]   What this meant was we had to have an incredibly tight and structured shooting schedule.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.100]   In fact, our production manager, Riley, had come up with a shooting schedule that had
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.100]   everything literally down to the minute.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.460]   And we had very precise amounts of time that we could spend in the location we were going
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.460]   to film.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.220]   So what would happen is we would show up in our big van that we had hired, we'd get to
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.460]   the location, we'd jump out the van, everybody would frantically get the cameras ready.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.100]   I would be frantically trying to memorize my lines.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.220]   Somebody would shout action.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.580]   I would stand in front of the camera and do my thing.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.580]   We'd get the shot, we'd jump back in the van and off we would drive to the next location.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.860]   It was crazy.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.740]   Now one of the episodes that we had planned was an episode on the baptism of Jesus.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.460]   And we thought to ourselves, how do we portray the power that there is in the baptism of
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.460]   Jesus?
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.820]   And we decided that what we would do is we would go to the formal baptism site of Jesus
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.980]   on the Jordan River and we would film and interview people getting baptized.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.980]   And we would ask them why they're getting baptized in the Jordan River and what baptism
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.980]   meant for them.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.060]   And we thought this would be a great way to help to communicate to the church the power
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.740]   of baptism.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.100]   Now three months prior to the filming trip, we took what's called a recce trip to Israel.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.540]   That's when you go and you scout all the locations.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.180]   And I remember on the recce trip, we showed up at the baptism site on the Jordan River
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.780]   and it was heaving with people.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.140]   There was probably about 200 people that were getting ready to be baptized.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.660]   There were people queuing up all over the place, getting to be let down into the water
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.660]   and to be baptized.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.660]   And we thought this is amazing.
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.500]   We're going to be easily be able to capture 20, 30, 40 different interviews from these
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.940]   people and it's going to be an incredible episode.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.500]   It was actually the one that we were looking forward to the most in filming.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.300]   So three months later, there we are in Israel.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:06.560]   We show up at our appointed time to film at the baptism site and no one is there.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.480]   Like no one.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.540]   It was open, but no one was there.
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.460]   There was not a tour bus in sight.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.820]   Now this was like day seven of our 10 days of shooting and we were all getting a little
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.540]   bit irritated at each other by this point.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.540]   You can imagine a crew that's lived together so tightly over such an intense period of
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.540]   time.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.420]   And I remember we get there and we're like, "Where are the people?
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.060]   Why are there no people here?
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.060]   This is ridiculous."
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.380]   And I remember being so angry and frustrated at the crew, at myself, at God.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.580]   I got out of the bus and I left them all behind on the bus and I stormed down angrily towards
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.620]   the baptism waters.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.580]   As I get down there, it's completely empty, but I look over to the right and standing
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:57.380]   under the shaded awning are two people, an older lady and her son.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.700]   I walk over to them and I introduce myself and they introduce themselves.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.460]   The lady's name was Perla and Perla was from the Philippines and it was her son that was
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.740]   with her.
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:16.060]   Now Perla was even more frustrated than I was, but she had a much better reason for
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.060]   it.
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.980]   Perla began to tell me her story.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.220]   At the age of five, she had a dream, an actual dream.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:31.700]   And in this dream, she saw somebody grab her hand and lead her down towards a muddy stretch
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.180]   of river water.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:41.360]   And as she walked down to it, the waves formed a word and the word was Jordan.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.940]   And she was led down by this person in her dream into these muddy waters that said Jordan
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.100]   and she gets dunked into the water.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.860]   She comes back out of it and then the person leads her out.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.740]   Now this is a five-year-old girl who doesn't really have a full understanding of what baptism
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.340]   is all about, but she shares the dream with her family who are all Christians and they
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.340]   get so excited.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.860]   "Wow, you had a dream where maybe it was Jesus who led you into the waters of baptism.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.780]   This is so amazing."
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.820]   And from that point forward, Perla had a long held dream in her heart.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:23.600]   Her dream was that one day she would get baptized in the Jordan River.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.920]   For 70 years, she held onto that dream.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.740]   And she was getting old in her life by this point.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.960]   And they were not from high socioeconomic means.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.280]   And so her son decided that, "Look, we need to do this before she passes away."
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.840]   So they managed amongst their friends and family and relatives to scrape enough money
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.900]   together to pay for a flight from the Philippines all the way to Israel.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.180]   They had arrived in Tel Aviv Airport that very morning.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:59.940]   They had jumped into a taxi and done the three and a half hour journey down to the baptismal
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:05.720]   site and they get out of the taxi and no one is there.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.940]   It's completely empty.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.700]   And she walks down to the waters and she's desperately trying to find somebody to baptize
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.600]   her and no one's there.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.700]   So she goes into the waters and she starts to baptize herself.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.120]   She takes the water and she's like trying to do this on her head.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.320]   And then she comes up out of the waters and she says to me these words after we'd been
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   talking for a while.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.520]   She said, "I got here and I was trying to baptize myself.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.460]   I came out of the water and I'm like, 'There's no priest.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.260]   There's no priest.'"
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:46.460]   That moment, the Holy Spirit rushed through me in a way that I had not experienced before.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:53.540]   And I said to her, I said, "I know I don't look like a priest, but actually I kind of
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.780]   am.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.500]   I'm a pastor of a church in Hong Kong.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.060]   Do you want me to baptize you?"
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.180]   You should have seen her face.
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.340]   She just lit up.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:10.200]   And I took her by the hand and I walked her down to the waters of the Jordan River.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.740]   And our film crew captured the whole thing on film.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.420]   Do you want to see it?
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.420]   You want to see it?
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.420]   All right.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.420]   Here it is.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.420]   Let's have a look.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.420]   I'm from the Philippines.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.980]   When I was little, I'm always going to church with my grandmother.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.100]   I always go to church and hear the Mass.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.860]   I try to go around the world because it's my dream.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:42.580]   I'm praying that I'm going to see the place where Jesus was born and it's my wish to be
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.500]   baptized in that place where Jesus was baptized.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.660]   When we come here and then we go down to the water, no priest.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.380]   But I say to my son, "Take me a picture."
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.100]   That just to remember I was here.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.580]   And I get the water.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.820]   I do like that.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:05.700]   And then I pick up the water and baptize myself like that.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.360]   And I pray a little.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.420]   And then I said, "Oh, there's no priest."
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.940]   And then we go up.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.860]   And then I said to my son, "Let's sit down.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.900]   I will pray a little."
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:29.500]   "Please come that you will baptize me here."
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.140]   And have you dedicated your life to following him the rest of your life?
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.140]   Yes, I do.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.140]   Wonderful.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.020]   That's why I'm very happy.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.060]   So it's my privilege, Ampala, to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:48.420]   Holy Spirit.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.860]   So I'm very lucky today that I'm baptized here.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.260]   I'm 75 years old tomorrow.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:02.340]   Yeah, isn't that beautiful?
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:09.460]   So I look a lot younger in that film.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.420]   So God spoke to me really powerfully after that moment.
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:19.180]   And here I was so frustrated that I couldn't get my little film made, that I couldn't get
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.820]   all the interviews of the baptisms that I wanted.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.400]   And God was like, "Andrew, you worry about such little things."
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:33.700]   And what I was doing was using you to be a part of fulfilling a dream that I had 70 years
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.140]   in the making.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:42.380]   I want you to know that we come to church today to celebrate a dream that has long been
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:50.100]   held on God's heart, the dream to reconcile humanity back to himself.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:56.700]   And we have 22 people across the day today, 11 at this service specifically, who are a
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:02.320]   living testimony that God had a dream on his heart for them.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.700]   And I want you to know in this room that God has a dream on his heart for you too, whether
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.740]   you are a Christian here or not.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.660]   If you're not a Christian here today and someone's invited you here, we're so glad you're here.
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.100]   And I want you to know that God has a dream on his heart for you.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.820]   And he's held that dream for years and years and years.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:25.780]   And he's wondering whether today might be the day where his dream for you is fulfilled.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:31.340]   If you're a Christian here, God holds dreams on his heart for you too.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.700]   Dreams for you to continue to live in the power of his resurrection, wanting you to
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.180]   live in such a way that would bring him glory.
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.660]   And he holds those dreams for you as well.
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:46.220]   For close to a thousand years, God held a dream in his heart.
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.420]   And he got it created humanity good.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.140]   He had created humanity in his image and humanity had this incredible relationship with him.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.780]   And yet then humanity decided to turn to its own ways, to rebel against God himself.
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.700]   And in so doing brought what we term and talk about as sin into the world.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.260]   But really this phrase sin, it just means brokenness.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.260]   It means rebellion.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.880]   It means the things that we do against God's heart.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.300]   And humanity comes and decides to live in that way.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.620]   When that happens, sin comes into the world at that point and the world has changed drastically
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.620]   from that point forward.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:24.060]   The Bible tells us that the wages or the cost of our sin is death.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.700]   And from that moment when humanity turns its back on God, there is a new narrative that
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.700]   is in the world.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:34.980]   It's the narrative of a sin that breaks us and leads us towards death.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.540]   For a thousand years, God holds on his heart this dream that one day he would send a Messiah.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.340]   One day he would send one from himself, a son of God, who would be able to reconcile
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.340]   and redeem humanity back to God because this one would be sinless.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.220]   This one would live a life where there would be no sin.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.980]   Because of that would be a perfect sinless sacrifice for humanity.
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.180]   And the prophets of old in Israel had prophesied about the coming of this dream.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:08.980]   And then in the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, that dream begins to happen.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.020]   And Jesus grows up and starts his ministry.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.300]   And it's amazing how Jesus starts his ministry.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:19.420]   He decides to start the ministry with a baptism, which is really fascinating because in that
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.740]   time baptism was done by John the Baptist.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.280]   And John the Baptist was baptizing people in the Jordan River, the very place that you
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.940]   saw in the film there.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.460]   And he was baptizing people as a repentance of their sin.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.980]   People were deciding that they didn't want to align themselves to the story of death
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.980]   anymore.
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.340]   And they wanted to align themselves to God again.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.540]   And baptism was a symbolic way for them to do that.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.340]   And Jesus at the start of his ministry thinks to himself, "What's the best way that I can
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.640]   start my ministry?"
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.000]   He decides to go into the waters of baptism.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.220]   Now this is interesting because he did not need to be baptized.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.860]   Jesus is the only one who's ever lived who's never needed baptism.
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.100]   As a sinless person, he didn't need the waters.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.700]   So the question is, what was Jesus doing there?
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.500]   Well, I think there's two things.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:10.060]   I think one thing was he was declaring solidarity with broken and sinful humanity.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:16.000]   He was saying, "I want to align my story with yours so later you could align your story
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   with mine."
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.260]   And he goes into the waters of baptism as a symbolic gesture of saying, "I understand
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.940]   what it is to be human."
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.420]   But I think he's also doing something.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:35.580]   I think more than that, he's actually prophetically beginning to speak of all that was to come
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.440]   at the end of his life.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:44.980]   For at the end of his life on the original Easter weekend, we see a baptisms of sorts
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.300]   taking place there.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:54.420]   Jesus on the Friday goes to the cross, having been arrested, betrayed by his friend, having
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:00.940]   been put on trial for something he did not do, having been beaten almost to death, nailed
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.740]   to a cross in excruciating pain.
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:12.900]   And then in that moment, as a perfect sinless sacrifice, taking on all of our brokenness,
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:20.220]   all of the brokenness of humanity then placed upon him, taking on the pain of sin in order
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.300]   that we would not have to.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.420]   And in his death, he is then buried.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.100]   Joseph and Nicodemus come and take his body down from the cross, and they wrap him in
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.860]   some grave clothes and shrouds, and they place him in the tomb.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:39.660]   Now they can't complete the burial because it's Sabbath now.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.700]   And so they step away for 24 hours.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.860]   And at the end of those 24 hours, the women come with the spices to continue to anoint
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.540]   his body for burial.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.460]   And of course, they walk into the tomb and his body they do not find.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:58.580]   But the burial is significant because the burial speaks of this idea that Jesus in that
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.740]   point separates himself.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.900]   We can kind of call it the lonely Saturday, if you will, a time where he is separated
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.180]   from humanity, but also separated from God.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:17.220]   And in that separation, trusts that God will raise him back to new life.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:22.980]   And on that third day, when the women arrive, when Peter runs into the tomb and the grave
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:29.340]   clothes are no longer on a body, but on the floor, symbolizing that the thing that symbolized
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.020]   sin and death was now discarded and not needed anymore.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.740]   And there's these incredible angels.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.260]   And they say to the women in particular, Mary herself, they say to Mary, "Hey, why do you
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.780]   look for the dead in this place?
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.220]   Why would you look for the living amongst the dead?
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.800]   For he's not here.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   He has risen."
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:55.260]   And they begin to realize that Jesus is no longer held by the captivity of death.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.740]   They understand that in his resurrection, he begins to forge a new path, begins to show
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:08.780]   this incredible idea that in the resurrection of life, death no longer has the final say.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:16.620]   And so Jesus begins his ministry in a representation of baptism, and he finishes his ministry in
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.900]   a moment of death and resurrection.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:25.420]   And it's the apostle Paul, one of the earliest theologians of the church, who pulls all these
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.340]   threads together and makes the connection.
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:35.100]   And he begins to understand what it is that we now do in the symbol of baptism as Christians.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.300]   I want to read this to you.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:41.780]   It's found in Romans chapter six, starting in verse three.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:48.380]   Says this, it says, "Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.980]   were baptized into his death?
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.740]   We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as Christ
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:02.740]   was raised from the dead through the glory of the father, we too may live a new life."
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.420]   He says, here's what is happening in the symbol of baptism.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.980]   He says baptism and Easter are completely linked.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:16.100]   In fact, what happened in that first Easter on the Friday and the Saturday and the Sunday,
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:22.400]   when we come to baptize people, when we come to our own baptism, we are symbolizing the
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.700]   movements of Easter.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.940]   Notice the first thing he says.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.420]   He says, "We are being baptized into his death."
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.780]   This is really powerful for Paul.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.740]   What he's saying is when we do baptism, we're not just symbolizing something, we are actually
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.780]   literally dying with him.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:46.660]   Our old self that has been dominated by the narrative of sin and death dies with him.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.300]   It goes into death with him.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.500]   When we baptize people, we bring them down towards the water.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:00.220]   The reason why we do that is because it symbolizes the trust that Jesus needed in his death on
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.220]   the cross.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:07.060]   When he said, "It is finished," and breathed out his last, he was relaxing, going back
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:13.620]   into the arms of God and 100% trusting him that he would rise him again.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:19.220]   We symbolize that beautiful thing that Jesus does on the cross as we take people down into
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.140]   the waters of baptism.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.500]   Jesus taking on our sin.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.460]   Jesus standing in the place where we should have stood.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.940]   Jesus receiving the punishment that should have come to us.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:34.820]   He stands in the gap and he says, "I don't want your story of death to continue more,
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.820]   for there's a new story that can come."
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.080]   Then Paul links this to the burial.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:47.200]   He says, "Therefore, we have therefore been buried with him through baptism."
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.180]   Baptism is not just about us aligning to the death of Jesus.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.540]   Baptism is also about us now aligning to the burial of Jesus.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:59.180]   That's where in the original burial there was a separation that took place.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:04.260]   So for us, that takes place as we take people down into the waters of baptism.
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.860]   What we do is we fully immerse people under the water.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:14.380]   I like to hold people under there for as long as possible, particularly if they look really
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.380]   sinful.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:19.340]   I shake them a little bit.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.260]   Watch this guys, because this is going to happen.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.900]   We hold people under the water because we're symbolizing a separation.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.060]   For Jesus, the separation was between humanity and him and him and God.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.380]   For us though, the separation is with our sin.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.700]   And we are separated in the burial of Christ as we align ourselves to his burial.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.100]   We separate ourselves from our sin.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:46.740]   It's like we take the grave clothes off of us and we lay them down once and for all.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.540]   If you were here with us on Friday, when we celebrated our Good Friday services, you may
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:56.220]   still be wearing one of these symbols of the grave clothes of Jesus with you.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:02.120]   What happens in the burial of baptism is that we finally remove those grave clothes.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:08.100]   We take them off of ourselves and we throw them away because we do not need them anymore.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.020]   And then what happens is we rise people back up into life.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.340]   Notice how Paul writes this here.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:18.780]   He says, "Just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.980]   may now live a new life."
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.980]   Notice from verse 5 onwards.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.140]   He says, "If we have been united with him like this into his death, we will certainly
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.060]   also be united with him in the resurrection.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:34.940]   For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin may be rendered
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.100]   powerless.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:42.820]   That we should no longer be slaves to sin because anyone who has died has been freed
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.820]   from sin."
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.340]   Paul does an incredible thing here.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.180]   He's like, "You want to know what happens in our baptism and how it aligns to that first
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.180]   Easter?"
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:54.180]   When we bring people out of the water, the water rushes off of them.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.500]   It's like the sin is washing away from them.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:03.780]   And he says, "When Jesus was raised from the dead, what God was proclaiming over all the
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:09.220]   world was that sin was rendered powerless."
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:13.260]   The Bible says that the wages of sin, the power of sin is death.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.300]   In Jesus' resurrection, he's saying, "Uh-uh.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.700]   Your life is no longer a full stop.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.180]   Death is not a full stop anymore.
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:26.540]   It's merely just a calmer and an ongoing journey because there is now resurrection."
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.660]   Sin has been rendered powerless.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.300]   It no longer has the power to define you to death.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.740]   Although it will still, every single day, try to drag you down that narrative.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:44.460]   But as a resurrected believer in Jesus, we have the same spirit in us that raised Jesus
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.460]   from the dead.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:52.340]   And that spirit enables us to testify that for us, sin is powerless.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.780]   That's the beauty of why we're here, guys.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.860]   That's what we're celebrating in the symbol of baptism, in the beauty of Easter weekend,
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.460]   that no longer is death our story.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:07.020]   This is why, my friends, baptism is always a public act.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.500]   Normally, when we do baptisms here at the Vine, we do it down at Repulse Bay on a Sunday
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.500]   afternoon because it's super public.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.820]   There's like hundreds of mainland tourists that gather around with their phones going,
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:22.980]   "What is going on with these people dunking each other?"
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.940]   We get a chance to go around and share the gospel with people who watch.
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.420]   You see, the reason why it's public is because of this.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:39.300]   Baptism is a subversive and radical proclamation to the world that there is indeed another
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.620]   story than the story of death.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:50.740]   Baptism is a bold proclamation that there is a new beginning for anyone who wants it
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.580]   at any time.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.660]   Anyone at any time.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.020]   That's the beauty of Easter.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.820]   That's what we celebrate as we gather here together, that anybody at any time can come
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.100]   into a new beginning, a new life.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.540]   They don't need to do a course.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.340]   They don't need to study for years.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.020]   They don't need to pretend that they're good.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.580]   They don't even need to get better.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.660]   They just need to come before Jesus and say, "Thank you."
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:19.020]   They need to say that, "I recognize that you have taken my sin.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.980]   I recognize that you've been raised again.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:28.460]   And I know I've got a long way to go to consider myself righteous, but I accept your righteousness.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.660]   I accept the work that you've done on the cross, and it now comes to me.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.740]   And my story has now changed."
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:44.820]   The dream that God holds on his heart for you is ultimately that your story would change,
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:54.900]   that you would not be a lying to the story of death, but a lying to the story of life.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.380]   We have literally died with Christ.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.700]   We have been buried with Christ, and we have been raised with Christ.
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.940]   That's what we celebrate today.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:14.060]   Not the thought of that, not a symbol of that, the reality that that is now our life.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.500]   And because that is our life, baptism is not just a one-off moment that we do and kind
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.980]   of forget about it.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.980]   In fact, what we're called to, my friends, is a baptized life.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.060]   We're called to a life that is defined by the realities of what baptism has done.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.300]   See, Easter is a reminder to us that we are to live this baptized life, that we are to
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.860]   recognize that we're now aligned to different concepts and different thoughts that God has
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:42.700]   in a different way that God sees the world, that we're aligned now to the dream that God
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.580]   has on his heart for humanity.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:50.380]   And that dream is always reconciliation, resurrection, and renewal.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.460]   That's our story now.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:56.500]   And when we think of Easter, we should be thinking about it like that.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.140]   Like I'm now living this baptized life, that death is no longer the end of my story.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.500]   There's a new story for me.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.700]   And every day is an opportunity for me to show the power of the Easter inside of me.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.580]   I should be living every day going, "What is it in my world that needs to be reconciled
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.020]   today?
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:19.380]   How can I live out this idea that I can be a partaker in the reconciliation of all things?
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:24.020]   Where are broken relationships in my life that need to be reconciled?
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.180]   Where are people around me that I can help reconcile with them?
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.900]   What is going on in my society that needs to be reconciled?"
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.460]   That's a baptized life.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.780]   What about the resurrection?
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.700]   What are some things that are dead inside of me right now?
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.220]   Maybe for some of you, there's some dead dreams inside of you, and today God wants to bring
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.960]   resurrection to them.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.020]   Maybe there are some habits that you're doing right now that you want to die.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.780]   I believe that if you bring them to Christ, he will help them to die for you, and he will
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:59.100]   resurrect new habits for you in place of the old that you've given to him.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:04.420]   There's always a resurrection that we're anxious for, that we're longing for in our lives.
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:08.220]   What does it mean for us every day to live in the power of Easter and say, "Lord, what
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:13.260]   is it that needs to be resurrected in me today?"
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.300]   And ultimately, God is here for renewal.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:22.340]   At the end of all things, in Revelations 21, it says this, "He will make all things new."
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.340]   It doesn't say, "He will make all new things."
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.340]   In other words, he's not wiping this whole thing out and starting again.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.180]   He makes all things that are currently what they are right now new.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.620]   People always say, "When you come to Christ Jesus, you are a new creation.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.660]   The old is gone.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.660]   The new has come."
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:43.200]   And if we celebrate anything on Easter, it's renewal.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.540]   It's the idea that I'm a new creation, that what was old and dead in me has now come into
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.600]   the fruition of new life.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.840]   That day when I was so angry and upset because my little film wasn't going to get made, Perler
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:04.860]   reminded me deeply that there are things far more important sometimes than just what is
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.820]   at our hands in that moment.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:13.640]   That sometimes God is working behind the scenes, always working behind the scenes, to bring
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.560]   people from death to life.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.660]   And if you want to live out Easter, that's the way to live it out, to have a radical
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:28.220]   thought, a subversive thought in your head, "Who am I going to encounter today that has
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:34.360]   been on God's heart for years and years that I might bring some reconciliation, resurrection,
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.360]   and renewal to?"
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.540]   What a beautiful way that would be to celebrate Easter.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.940]   There's this beautiful thing that Perler says to me.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.040]   She says, "There's no priest.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.560]   There's no priest."
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.660]   Because of that, she was trying to baptize herself.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.420]   The Bible is clear that we can't baptize ourselves.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:56.800]   The Bible is clear that we can't get resurrection life in our own strength, that even our really
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.900]   good acts and really good deeds doesn't get us there.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.300]   But here's the hope.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.520]   Hebrews speaks of Jesus this way.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:09.180]   It says, "In his resurrection, we now have a good high priest for all eternity."
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:15.300]   In other words, Perler's words those days no longer need to be muttered by anybody.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.880]   Nobody now longer has to say, "There is no priest.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.380]   How do I try to do this myself?"
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:26.140]   Because of the death and resurrection of Jesus, we have a good high priest every moment of
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:32.460]   every day so that anyone at any time can change.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.100]   That's what we celebrate, my friends.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:40.400]   And if you want to walk out Easter, if you want to be people of Easter, may you be people
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:48.220]   who live a baptized life of reconciliation, resurrection, and renewal.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.760]   In Jesus' name.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.760]   Can I ask you to stand?
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:57.320]   I want to pray for you.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.200]   If you were here with us on Friday, over the worship time we're about to have now, I want
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   to invite you.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.640]   You can remove your little grave clothes, symbols of grave clothes that you're wearing.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.880]   In a moment, we're going to baptize these 11 incredible people.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.040]   And I want to invite you.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.600]   We're going to do this in a atmosphere of worship.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.840]   There's going to be worship happening here.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.760]   I want to invite you to worship.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.240]   It's not necessarily a spectator thing.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.380]   It's something for us to worship together.
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:24.000]   But as somebody comes out of the waters of baptism, could we give the loudest cheer possible
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   for them?
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.120]   And as we cheer them, what we're doing is we're saying, "That's also my story.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.600]   That's also who I am.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:37.200]   I am also one who's gone from death to resurrection because of this Sunday, because of the work
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   of Easter together."
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.760]   So let me pray for us.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.000]   Would you open your hands with me?
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.060]   Father, we just are so grateful that we get to come now to celebrate the beauty and power
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.000]   that is in baptism.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.480]   So grateful that Paul was able to pull the threads together and help apply it to Easter
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   itself.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.480]   And now we understand why Jesus got baptized at the start of his ministry and went to the
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.920]   cross at the end of his ministry.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.360]   Because right at the start, he declared what the work is that he would do, going down to
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.480]   death, going into burial so that he could be raised.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:15.160]   Lord, as we now worship you in the reality of our resurrection, may we do so with great
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.120]   joy in our hearts.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:26.320]   In Jesus' name, everyone stands.
