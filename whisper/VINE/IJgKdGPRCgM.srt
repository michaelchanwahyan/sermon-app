1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
 Happy Chinese New Year, everyone.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,640
 So I hope you all had some good time over the past few days,

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,440
 perhaps enjoying some good food, enjoying some time

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,600
 with your family and friends.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,960
 If you say, oh, I don't really celebrate Chinese New Year,

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,120
 I hope you enjoy some time off during the public holiday

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,320
 as well.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
 So my name is Jennifer.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,160
 I grew up in Hong Kong.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,400
 And my family is quite a traditional Chinese one.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,480
 So Chinese New Year has always been a big thing

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,320
 that we celebrate, especially when I was a kid.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,720
 So there are a lot of things that we do as a family.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,920
 We need to clean our house.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,280
 We go visit our families.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,200
 We buy new clothes.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,360
 And we will host dinners at our place as well.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,600
 So it's been a lot that we do in the new year.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,680
 But the intention behind the whole thing

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,400
 is really we hope to start our year well.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,440
 So among all the things, there's one thing

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,520
 that I would like to highlight to you today

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,000
 is during Chinese New Year, we will say some blessings

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,520
 to each other.

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,960
 So for example, my family has been teaching me

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,080
 that each family can be different.

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,200
 But my family has been teaching me

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
 that the very first thing I say to a person

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,480
 if this is my first time seeing them in a new year

30
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,640
 is a blessing.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,760
 So in case, like, for example, Gordon,

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,320
 this is our first time meeting in a new year.

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,720
 So I supposed to say a blessing over him,

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,880
 something like [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] or [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,760
 things like that.

36
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,760
 The very first thing I say to him should be a blessing.

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,240
 So let me introduce a few blessings

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,960
 that are commonly used among the Chinese community

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,880
 in Hong Kong.

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,080
 So the very first one I think many of you

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,280
 will be heard of this is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
 It means wish you get rich.

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,640
 And then the second one is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
 is wish you good health.

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,480
 Sounds good, right?

46
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,720
 And then the third one is an interesting one

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,960
 that I would like to teach you is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
 Doing good.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,480
 And the literal translation is I wish

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,120
 your heart desires come true.

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,760
 Sounds really good, right?

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,360
 Sometimes I really hope things happen that way,

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,880
 that my heart desires will come true.

54
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,280
 And yes, I said the whole idea behind this

55
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,200
 is to start our year well.

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,800
 And there's also a belief behind that.

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
 If we do these things, it will bring us good luck

58
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,480
 throughout the whole year.

59
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,760
 So my family is not a Christian one.

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,920
 So they really take this tradition very seriously.

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,080
 So growing up, the very first thing

62
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,040
 I need to do on a New Year day before even brushing my teeth

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,240
 is to go to my parents' bedroom and say at least three

64
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,760
 blessings to each of them.

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,840
 If I pass the exam, I will get my license from them.

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,320
 So that's how it works.

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,000
 And also, my parents would always

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,880
 make sure I say the right thing to the right people,

69
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,000
 especially when they're around me.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,720
 So for example, if I'm seeing an older person,

71
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,560
 I must say I wish you good health.

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,520
 If I'm seeing a business person, I must say I wish you get rich.

73
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,520
 So this is how serious it is for my family.

74
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,680
 It sounds like an oral exam, I know.

75
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,120
 But sometimes I feel like it as well.

76
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,880
 And so slowly, this whole tradition--

77
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,640
 because I have to do this every year.

78
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,680
 My parents will make me say something

79
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
 to them and to other people.

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,600
 And it has become a formula to me in my head.

81
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,320
 So whenever I see a person, my brain

82
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,800
 will automatically go search the right word I should

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,000
 say to them in a new year.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,840
 But do these words run through my heart?

85
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,840
 Do I really bless them wholeheartedly?

86
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,480
 Maybe not.

87
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,520
 I almost feel like I'm just doing it for doing's sake.

88
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,560
 I do it because this is what a Chinese does during CNY.

89
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,240
 And how about you?

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,480
 If you are Chinese in this room, perhaps you

91
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,120
 can resonate this with me as well.

92
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,400
 Perhaps you also find yourself just blessing one another out

93
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,360
 of the ritual or tradition.

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,360
 It feels like we are doing things out of habit.

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,480
 And I hope I'm not lonely in this room feeling that way.

96
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,920
 And perhaps for those who are not Chinese in this room,

97
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,880
 you might not 100% understand what I was saying.

98
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,320
 But actually, there are things we Christians

99
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,280
 say to each other as well.

100
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,440
 Let me give you some example.

101
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,880
 God bless you.

102
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,240
 Or I'll pray for you.

103
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,280
 Or-- I hear some laugh already.

104
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
 Let's catch up some time.

105
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,080
 How about this?

106
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,960
 Or I would like to involve more and serve more.

107
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,600
 Do they sound familiar?

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,040
 Yeah, these are the things that we say to each other as well.

109
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,280
 But are we saying from the bottom of our hearts?

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,320
 Do we always mean it?

111
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,120
 Or do we always back our words with our actions?

112
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,520
 Last week, Pastor Promise shared with us

113
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,840
 that Jonathan said he loved David as himself.

114
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,520
 And Jonathan backed these words up with his whole life,

115
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,800
 actually.

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
 So for us as well, it is important to back our words

117
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
 with actions.

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,880
 And right now, we are still at the beginning of the year.

119
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,640
 Do any of us have the New Year resolution

120
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,280
 of spending more time with God, or spending more time to pray,

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,880
 or spending more time to read the Bible?

122
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,200
 I'm one of them.

123
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,920
 So how is it going?

124
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,400
 I need to confess that.

125
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,440
 I say these things every year at the beginning of the year.

126
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,560
 But when my schedule gets full, the first thing I sacrifice

127
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,160
 is spending time with God too.

128
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,200
 And of course, personally, I want to spend more time

129
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,840
 with God.

130
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,080
 And I'm sure all of us in this room

131
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,440
 would want to be closer to God as well.

132
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
 We want to be more like Jesus.

133
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,160
 We want to make Him pleased with all the things we do.

134
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,920
 But why do we stop at wanting to do something,

135
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,320
 but not making it happen?

136
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,520
 Why do we say we are going to do something,

137
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,280
 but not following through with it?

138
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,400
 So to be honest, our faith does not

139
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,080
 work like the Chinese New Year blessing, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

140
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,520
 "May your heart's desire come true."

141
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,680
 Our heart's desire do not just come true automatically.

142
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,840
 And we always need to do something and make them happen.

143
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,800
 In the year of 2025, as a church,

144
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,760
 we have a theme of action.

145
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,680
 I think many of us are very excited to do something

146
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,800
 together.

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,920
 It is really essential to allow our action

148
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,520
 to align with our heart's desire, and more importantly,

149
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,880
 to align with our faith.

150
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,680
 We don't want to do something together just for doing's sake,

151
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,960
 or the other way around, that we want to do something,

152
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,680
 but we stop at just wanting or saying, and end up not doing it.

153
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,720
 So it is amazing that there's a whole book in the Bible that

154
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,360
 tells us about moving our faith into action.

155
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,960
 As we read it, we might find his theology

156
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,160
 a little bit different from Paul's,

157
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,280
 saved by faith along theology, as he argues the importance

158
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,320
 of action coming with our faith.

159
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,000
 But if we look into it deeper, we

160
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
 will find it makes sense, because he

161
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,360
 asks practical application to Paul's theology.

162
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,480
 And this book is written by the apostle James,

163
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,120
 and therefore the book is called the Book of James.

164
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,400
 We will look into a few verses in chapter 2 today.

165
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,760
 And let me read it for you.

166
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,520
 "What good is it, my brothers and sisters,

167
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,240
 if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?

168
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,400
 Can such faith save them?

169
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,000
 Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food.

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,840
 If one of you says to them, go in peace, keep warm,

171
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,720
 and well fed, but does nothing about their physical needs,

172
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,520
 what good is it?

173
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,120
 In the same way, faith by itself,

174
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,560
 if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.

175
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,640
 But someone will say, you have faith, I have deeds.

176
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,600
 Show me your faith without deeds,

177
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,480
 and I will show you my faith by my deeds.

178
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,520
 You believe that there is one God.

179
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,120
 Good, even the demons believe that and shudder.

180
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,880
 You foolish person, do you want evidence

181
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,880
 that faith without deeds is useless?

182
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,960
 Was not our father Abraham considered righteous

183
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,440
 for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?

184
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,360
 You see that his faith and his actions were working together,

185
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,840
 and his faith was made complete by what he did.

186
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,280
 And the scripture was fulfilled that says,

187
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,640
 Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,

188
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,840
 and he was called God's friend.

189
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,520
 You see that a person is considered righteous

190
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,840
 by what they do and not by faith alone.

191
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,560
 In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute

192
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,040
 considered righteous for what she did

193
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,000
 when she gave lodging to the spies

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,480
 and sent them off in a different direction?

195
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,520
 As the body without the spirit is dead,

196
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,560
 so faith without deeds is dead.

197
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,800
 So here, James is clarifying what a true faith is,

198
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,720
 what it means to be a Christian.

199
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,400
 James asked us a question,

200
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,560
 what good is faith without deeds?

201
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,400
 In other words, what good is faith without action?

202
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,600
 Is faith only about believing there's one God

203
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,920
 who is Jesus Christ?

204
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,440
 Let's ask ourselves this question for a moment.

205
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,800
 Is our faith authentic faith if we never reach to a point of action?

206
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,120
 We can imagine if the apostles who had faith,

207
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,120
 but they never reached to a point of action,

208
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,600
 I think the church today would not have existed.

209
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,640
 And as Jesus called the disciples,

210
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,880
 he did not just call them to believe that he is the son of God.

211
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,560
 In fact, Jesus called the disciples to follow,

212
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,120
 and following is an action.

213
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,880
 Some of you might start thinking,

214
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,000
 didn't Jesus and the apostle Paul emphasize that

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,440
 we are saved by faith and grace instead of following the law?

216
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,680
 That is very true that we are saved by grace of God alone.

217
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,360
 And in fact, we can never save ourselves by doing anything.

218
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,440
 The deeds James is referring here isn't the deeds of the law,

219
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,880
 but the deeds as a demonstration of our faith outwardly.

220
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,360
 It might sound similar or it might look the same

221
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,880
 because we can be doing the same thing,

222
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,360
 but internally it could be very different.

223
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,880
 Let me give you a simple example.

224
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,080
 So let's talk about praying before a meal.

225
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,880
 So I grew up with a teaching that if I am a real Christian,

226
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,160
 I must pray before every meal.

227
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,800
 And it doesn't matter whom I'm eating with.

228
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,000
 It doesn't matter whether or not they are Christians,

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,680
 but my prayer needs to be visible

230
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,240
 to the people I'm eating with.

231
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,000
 I can be praying silently,

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,040
 but I need to show that I'm praying

233
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,880
 and show that I'm a Christian.

234
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,400
 So if we think about this,

235
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,320
 it sounds like the works of the law, right?

236
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,120
 Because it operates like this,

237
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,840
 because we are a Christian,

238
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,840
 therefore we need to pray before every meal

239
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,280
 to show that I'm a Christian.

240
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,160
 But while there are other people who prays before every meal

241
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,600
 because they believe that,

242
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,080
 we believe that everything is provided by God,

243
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,120
 every meal is provided by God.

244
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,520
 So we want to give him thanks before every meal.

245
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,320
 And it is totally different from the motive.

246
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,840
 Like it is an outworking action from what we believe.

247
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,840
 So these two things, these two examples,

248
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,720
 they can look exactly the same.

249
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,960
 We are like, they're all praying before a meal,

250
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,640
 but they actually come from very different motives.

251
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,160
 And therefore they can have very different results.

252
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,200
 And I want us to pay attention to how James understands

253
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,400
 the relationship of faith and deeds.

254
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,600
 In verse 14, he says,

255
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,960
 "What good is it if someone claims to have faith,

256
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
 "but has no deeds?"

257
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,520
 Let's pay attention here.

258
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,800
 James didn't say,

259
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,800
 "What good is it if someone has faith, but has no deeds?"

260
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,160
 He said, "Someone who claims to have faith."

261
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,700
 In other words, James is referring to someone

262
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,680
 who says they have faith,

263
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,600
 but never reached to a point of action.

264
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,160
 And these people, they are deceiving themselves.

265
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,440
 And the faith is just a self-declaration.

266
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,160
 But again, James is not introducing

267
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,400
 some new salvation formula

268
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,160
 that is different from Jesus' teaching.

269
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,560
 He's not telling us that faith plus action

270
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,780
 equals to salvation.

271
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,040
 It's not like now we have faith in Jesus

272
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,160
 and we add a little bit of action in there,

273
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,320
 then that's salvation.

274
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,880
 He is telling us that faith by its own nature

275
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,160
 includes action.

276
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,120
 In other words, action is the result of our faith.

277
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,120
 We desire to do something for God

278
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,440
 because we have been given a new hope,

279
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,180
 a new life, a new identity.

280
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,480
 And out of the faith and salvation,

281
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,620
 we have received from God,

282
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,660
 we put that salvation into practice.

283
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,840
 It doesn't add to our salvation,

284
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,400
 it is an outworking of our salvation.

285
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,820
 So action is the natural result of our faith.

286
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,320
 So we can't have faith but do nothing about it.

287
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,880
 And James used Abraham as an example,

288
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,120
 that Abraham has faith,

289
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,640
 but he also had deeds that originated in his faith.

290
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,080
 And because of his actions that followed from his faith,

291
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,600
 God declared him as righteous.

292
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,760
 Faith is like a seed planted inside each one of us,

293
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,400
 and our words and our actions are the fruits of our faith.

294
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,960
 In fact, we are all different

295
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,800
 and our action can look very differently.

296
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
 And most of us here in this room,

297
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,760
 I'm sure you're not called to sacrifice your son, right?

298
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,600
 Right, Alison?

299
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,640
 [audience laughing]

300
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,440
 But there is one thing that is applicable

301
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,560
 to all of us today is like,

302
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,520
 there is a cost in following Jesus.

303
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,880
 It means putting our faith into action,

304
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,920
 it means following God's call and do something.

305
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,420
 And it could look differently to each of us.

306
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,400
 So I would like to ask, how is God calling you to act?

307
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,560
 Is there anything God is conflicting you to do for him

308
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,680
 in the coming year?

309
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,800
 One more thing I would like to highlight in this passage

310
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,800
 is that James concerns our faith in relation to others.

311
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,680
 He gave us a scenario in verses 15 to 16

312
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,400
 that if a person who has no clothes, no daily food,

313
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,960
 and he came to us, but if we say to them,

314
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,360
 "Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,

315
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,680
 "but do nothing about their physical needs."

316
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,380
 How do we feel about this?

317
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,320
 It sounds terrible, right?

318
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,800
 But if we are honest,

319
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,540
 sometimes we Christians do this as well.

320
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,840
 When we see people in need, we might say,

321
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,680
 "God bless you," or "I'll pray for you."

322
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,080
 Praying is great and blessing people is wonderful as well,

323
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,640
 it's powerful.

324
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,980
 We need to continue to do this to people.

325
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,980
 But let's be reminded that our faith cannot stop

326
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,160
 at saying something nice to each other,

327
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,360
 but not doing anything about it.

328
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,400
 James says, "Such faith is dead."

329
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,280
 Let's do better than this.

330
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,540
 So what does living faith mean?

331
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,440
 If we read the rest of the book of James,

332
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,640
 which is heavily on the topic of faith and deeds,

333
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,520
 he says a lot about our relationship with others.

334
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
 He speaks again favoritism,

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,200
 he says about caring for the poor.

336
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,840
 Again, this is not some laws for us to follow,

337
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,400
 but our faith conflicts us to showcase the love of God

338
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,360
 to people around us.

339
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,320
 This is who God is.

340
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,320
 This is a God who loves and cares for people,

341
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,560
 not just saying it, but through our action.

342
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,400
 And sometimes it will mean meeting people's physical needs.

343
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,460
 I'm not saying that we need to meet everyone's need

344
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,480
 when they come all the time,

345
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,400
 but sometimes it does mean that we need

346
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,980
 to meet physical needs of people.

347
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,720
 And more importantly,

348
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,640
 God called us to be part of his action.

349
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,520
 He called us to be more like him.

350
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,640
 And through our actions,

351
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,640
 we are demonstrating who God is to the people around us.

352
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,340
 It is always about people.

353
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,460
 God does not just intend us to be isolated

354
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,740
 and to be close to him only.

355
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,080
 God always intend us to follow our faith

356
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,900
 to shape us in how we are interacting with people.

357
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:27,260
 This is also what Jesus commanded us, to love one another.

358
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,800
 As we are actioning, it is important to keep in mind

359
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,880
 that we are not just doing something good

360
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,460
 in the public's eyes,

361
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,640
 but we are actually doing the work of God

362
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,720
 as the followers of Jesus.

363
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,680
 As the love of God is in us,

364
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,280
 and we are to reflect who God is

365
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,760
 and bring the love of God to the world.

366
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,680
 This might sound very big and scary,

367
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,760
 but loving people can be really reflected

368
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,800
 in the smallest ways on a personal level.

369
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,920
 It is really a way of living.

370
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,520
 So how do we do this?

371
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,880
 How do we practically put James' call into action

372
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,140
 in the city of Hong Kong?

373
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,800
 In a relationship that we had around us?

374
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,440
 How do we ensure we're not just saying words,

375
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,140
 but putting our faith into action?

376
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,920
 Let me give you a few examples

377
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,680
 to help you to think about this,

378
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,560
 and then you can think about how you can apply it

379
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,360
 into your own life.

380
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,680
 So in today's culture, people tend to put ourselves first,

381
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,620
 especially in Hong Kong.

382
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,920
 We value efficiency and convenience.

383
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,000
 We can't waste one minute on anything, really.

384
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,680
 If we get to the train station,

385
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,200
 if we see the next train is in three minutes,

386
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,880
 it's too long, right?

387
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,520
 And you can tell how efficient we are

388
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,720
 by how we walk on the street,

389
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,280
 by how we drive on the road, right?

390
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,440
 So Hong Kong people do not really value

391
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,540
 being considerate, to be honest.

392
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,360
 You know what I mean?

393
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,400
 So, (laughs)

394
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,400
 so what does following Jesus in this space look like?

395
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,360
 How can we be considerate to people

396
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,600
 as we are living in this environment?

397
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,520
 And also, with our friends as well,

398
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,880
 we always say to each other,

399
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,280
 "Let's catch up more, let's hang out,"

400
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,760
 but do we always put that in our schedule

401
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,060
 and make time for that?

402
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,400
 Or we put it in our schedule,

403
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,800
 it makes it to my schedule,

404
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,720
 but I don't feel like it on the day,

405
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,600
 so what do I do?

406
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,240
 These things sound familiar, right?

407
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,960
 So what does loving people mean in this space as well?

408
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,140
 And I think being consistent and honoring people's time

409
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,480
 is one way to do it.

410
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,760
 And our faith does not only exist for the big moments,

411
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,260
 the turning points in our life.

412
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,200
 Our faith is also reflected in these smallest things

413
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,680
 in our everyday life, how we treat people,

414
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,520
 how we make choices, how we choose

415
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,760
 to put other people's needs above ourselves.

416
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,840
 Where do we choose to sit or stand in a public transport

417
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,940
 or on a Sunday, or in what condition

418
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,680
 we are leaving the bathroom to the next person

419
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
 is one way to reflect it.

420
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,320
 You know what I mean?

421
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,680
 These smallest things in our life,

422
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,440
 have we thought about what kind of faith

423
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,040
 are we demonstrating or what do we want to demonstrate?

424
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,040
 How is your faith conflicting you

425
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,300
 on how to interact with people?

426
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,160
 Is your faith conflicting you to do something

427
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,640
 for the people in need?

428
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,120
 Let me share my story of how God conflicted me personally

429
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,120
 to put my faith into action when I was in seminary.

430
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,120
 So I started studying in seminary

431
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,860
 before I actually started working in ministry.

432
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,680
 I was working in corporate, I was thinking about ministry,

433
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,680
 so I started a part-time program in a seminary.

434
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,620
 And then later I joined the staff team at the Fine,

435
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,120
 so I've started working here also as a full-time staff.

436
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,380
 So in my seminary life, I have always been

437
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,420
 a part-time student with a full-time job.

438
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,240
 As you can imagine, I need to be quite diligent

439
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,400
 with how I use my time.

440
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,180
 I need to set good boundaries at work

441
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,120
 so I can get off on time and show in school in person.

442
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,020
 And yes, my school requires me to go in person all the time.

443
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,320
 And then also to make time to do my coursework as well,

444
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,000
 to write assignments, write the papers.

445
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,520
 So my time being in school campus

446
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,420
 has always been very functional.

447
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,500
 When I show up in school, I was either in class

448
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,460
 or either I'm hiding in library doing my research

449
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,740
 and doing my homework.

450
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,620
 By the way, I love working in library.

451
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,600
 It's quiet, it has a lot of books and resources,

452
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,580
 and I can be quiet processing the thoughts in my mind.

453
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,420
 So I really love that.

454
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,880
 However, one big belief of my school

455
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,860
 is that we are a learning community.

456
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,380
 And community plays a big part in our learning

457
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,300
 and equipping process, which I really appreciate now,

458
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,100
 not so much back then.

459
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,020
 So whenever my school has some optional events,

460
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,780
 like show-show events, I had a very easy excuse

461
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,080
 that I say all the time.

462
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,440
 I'm just a part-time student,

463
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,140
 I can't commit to anything else.

464
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,800
 So my school was very gracious to part-time students like me

465
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,240
 and I held on to my excuse for a few years.

466
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,740
 In my first few years, I was really happy with my patent,

467
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,680
 but until I started working here in ministry,

468
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,600
 I started to feel that my study patent doesn't seem right.

469
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,920
 It feels like I'm just there

470
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,260
 to fulfill the course requirement and to just get a degree.

471
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,280
 Although if I was still able to learn something new,

472
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,680
 that was not enough.

473
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,100
 So I realized my patent does not allow me

474
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,100
 to fulfill what I was sensing God is calling me to do.

475
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,280
 Something needs to change.

476
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,940
 If I also believe that community plays a part

477
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,220
 in my learning and equipping process,

478
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,620
 I can't be just showing up to the class

479
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,500
 and then hiding in the library all the time.

480
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,340
 If I also believe that community

481
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,420
 is an expression of my faith,

482
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,140
 if I believe that Jesus is calling me

483
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,540
 to learn with those people,

484
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,020
 I need to actually spend time with them.

485
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:07,520
 And my next steps is to actually doing it.

486
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,460
 I can't be saying to my schoolmates

487
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,420
 that I want to get more involved

488
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,700
 and spend more time with you,

489
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,540
 but not doing anything about it.

490
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,300
 I needed to sort out my priorities.

491
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,700
 It doesn't mean that I don't care

492
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,220
 about my work here or my study anymore.

493
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,320
 Those two things still have higher priority in my life,

494
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,780
 but I needed to prioritize my schoolmates,

495
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,020
 perhaps over my excuses at the moments

496
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,680
 that I don't feel like it.

497
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,940
 And I need to prioritize people over my comfort zone,

498
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,020
 which is the library.

499
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,980
 I needed to change my patent,

500
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,740
 which means showing up to the common area

501
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,860
 instead of the library,

502
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,940
 make time to talk to people,

503
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,100
 enjoying their social events.

504
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,920
 And I needed to drop my excuses

505
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,220
 and walk out of my comfort zone.

506
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,980
 Was I stretched?

507
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,880
 Absolutely.

508
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,260
 Does it worth it?

509
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,180
 Even so.

510
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,700
 So I wonder if you're holding on to any excuses

511
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,860
 and allowing those to stop you

512
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,740
 from doing what God is calling you to do.

513
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:27,020
 As I shared at the beginning,

514
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,760
 during CNY, we often say things to people out of habit

515
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,300
 or rituals, but not really meaning it.

516
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,040
 We can't go forward as Christians here,

517
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,140
 especially in a year of action in 2025

518
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,680
 with the same attitude.

519
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,280
 We must check our hearts and ask ourselves,

520
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,300
 where our motives are coming from.

521
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,620
 This is step number one.

522
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,860
 But we can't stop here.

523
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,820
 We can't just follow with our mouths only.

524
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,820
 We must put our faith into action.

525
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,380
 In order to do that,

526
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,260
 we will look into some practical ways

527
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,340
 we can put our faith into actions.

528
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,020
 So the first one is to seek God.

529
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,900
 As I said just now,

530
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,140
 checking our hearts and motive is step one.

531
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,200
 Before we take any actions,

532
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
 we need to be intentional about

533
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,200
 to allow God speak to us on what and how to act.

534
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,840
 Just like what the apostles did.

535
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,600
 Like I said, it doesn't have to be big things all the time.

536
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,920
 We can ask God each day how we can demonstrate our faith

537
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,760
 and his love before we go about our day,

538
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,120
 before we go to work, before we go to school,

539
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,320
 when we wake up in the morning or on our way.

540
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,160
 We can ask God about that.

541
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,240
 And also if you have important things during the day,

542
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,680
 do that before your important meetings.

543
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,280
 Ask God how would he want you to act.

544
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:08,480
 And then number two is we need to watch our choices.

545
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
 As we go about our day,

546
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,840
 there are a lot of things we do out of habits.

547
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,520
 Like getting on trains, going to work,

548
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,260
 going out for lunch, doing our groceries.

549
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,000
 We might not pay attention to these moments,

550
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,160
 but there are actually a lot of human interactions

551
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,040
 in those spaces and we make a lot of choices out of habit.

552
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,360
 So perhaps we can be intentional about our choices

553
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,960
 and ask ourselves,

554
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,640
 are we choosing to be considerate to people?

555
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,840
 Are we choosing to demonstrate love

556
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,800
 to people with our choices?

557
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,720
 And number three, it is our priorities.

558
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,840
 Let's be honest, we all have limited time and resources.

559
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,800
 As we look at our schedule, ask ourselves,

560
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,200
 what are our top priorities

561
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,280
 that we must give our attention to?

562
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,920
 And what are the things that are occupying us

563
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,860
 from doing the important things?

564
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,120
 And are there any excuses we are holding onto,

565
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,020
 like what I did in seminary?

566
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,000
 If there is something that God is convicting us to do,

567
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 we need to make time for that

568
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,820
 and make them one of our priorities.

569
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,340
 And the final one is to honor our promises.

570
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,800
 If we say to God or we say to each other

571
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,840
 that we will do something, let's honor that.

572
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,520
 If you are bad at this, perhaps put it in your diaries

573
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,660
 or setting an alarm or reminder,

574
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,280
 or perhaps ask someone who is close to you

575
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,040
 to keep you on track and hold you accountable.

576
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,820
 Just find a way that is workable for you.

577
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,420
 And let's approach 2025 together

578
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,080
 with putting our words into action and live out our faith.

579
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,600
 If we want to spend more time to read the Bible,

580
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,920
 open the Bible and read it.

581
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,760
 I can't think of anything else

582
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,800
 that other way that we can do it.

583
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,920
 If you want to spend more time to pray,

584
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,360
 take away your phone or other distractions and pray.

585
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,760
 This is the only way to do it.

586
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,600
 If you want to serve the people around you,

587
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,760
 make sure you commit yourself to prioritize this

588
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,280
 so you don't make people down.

589
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,300
 And I hope in 2025, we will be a community

590
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,300
 that allow our faith to shape us inwardly and outwardly.

591
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,460
 And also as a community,

592
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,020
 as we are entering into a year of action,

593
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:53,020
 if you also believe that action is part of our faith,

594
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,020
 get ourself ready to be part of the action.

595
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,980
 Not because everyone else is doing it,

596
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,680
 not just doing it for doing's sake,

597
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,800
 but let's demonstrate our faith as a church.

598
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,420
 So I hope this is encouraging,

599
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,380
 this excites you to do something for God.

600
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,400
 As I said, it could look very differently to each one of us

601
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,880
 because we are all unique

602
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,360
 and we all have different sphere of influence.

603
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,640
 So I'm not sure how you feel about this

604
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,000
 or how clear you feel that God is calling you

605
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,520
 to do something, but I'm sure if you are a believer,

606
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,520
 you have a relationship with Jesus.

607
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,700
 He has a purpose in you.

608
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,960
 And there is a way that you can be part of his action,

609
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,340
 no matter in a big way or in a small way.

610
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,440
 So may I invite you to stand as we pray to close.

611
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,600
 [silence]

612
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:05,340
 Dear Jesus, we thank you.

613
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:12,840
 We thank you that you are such an almighty God

614
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,520
 and with all the powers in your hand,

615
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,380
 you can basically do anything by yourself,

616
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,560
 but you have chosen us to be your people

617
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,380
 and you have chosen us to be part of your action.

618
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,360
 Lord, we thank you so much for this opportunity

619
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,120
 and we thank you so much that we are called

620
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,760
 to be your people.

621
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,880
 Lord, we pray for each one of us in this room.

622
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 We believe that you have a purpose in each one of us.

623
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,620
 You intend us to shine for you

624
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,460
 and to be your hands and feet

625
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,060
 in our different spaces we have in our lives.

626
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:17,900
 That you intend us to love the people around us

627
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,900
 and to show what your love is to the people around us.

628
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:33,200
 So Lord, we pray that your Holy Spirit will show us

629
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,960
 how we can love the people around us,

630
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,460
 how we can be in action for you,

631
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,120
 not only in the big moments,

632
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,120
 remind us to not overlook the small everyday moments.

633
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,920
 Show us what you see.

634
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,940
 Show us how we can serve you

635
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,720
 and serve other people in those areas.

636
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,000
 And also to allow us to grow

637
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,360
 in loving people and compassion.

638
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,640
 And we pray for those who of us

639
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,360
 who might not 100% sure what the purpose is,

640
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,680
 how we can follow this.

641
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,040
 Lord, we pray that you will show us,

642
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,160
 not only show us, but you will take us on this journey

643
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,600
 and you will show us on each step we are taking.

644
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:42,640
 And for those of who of us are really excited about this,

645
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,240
 we already know that you have put a calling in us.

646
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,960
 We are excited to put that calling into action

647
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,520
 in the coming year.

648
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,840
 Lord, we pray that you will remind us

649
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,640
 to be even more attentive to your heart,

650
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,100
 to seek you first before we do anything,

651
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,360
 to seek you all the time.

652
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,800
 Lord, may you give us an attentive heart.

653
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,560
 And we invite the Holy Spirit to continue

654
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,960
 to config us as one community,

655
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,320
 to config us on how we can serve you together

656
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,700
 as one church, as one community.

657
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,480
 And if we are holding onto any fears, any excuses,

658
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,520
 we pray that you will give us the courage

659
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,380
 and you will give us the strength to overcome them.

660
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,840
 Lord, thank you that you have sent us

661
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,260
 to be part of your action,

662
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,120
 and yet you didn't leave us alone.

663
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,040
 And your Holy Spirit is always there to guide us

664
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,100
 and lead us.

665
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:00,060
 And we have one another to do them together.

666
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,920
 So Lord, in the coming year,

667
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,000
 we pray that we can be your hands and feet

668
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,520
 and we can bring your love to the world around us.

669
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
 And we thank you in Jesus' name.

670
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,100
 (gentle music)
