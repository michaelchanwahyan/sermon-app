1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Would you believe that change?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Would you believe that change?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Would you believe that change?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Would you believe that change?

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 There's a voice, sounds of wonders from above

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 When you put out your springboard

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 On the old and new

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 In the power of your presence

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Holy Spirit reign, fall in like a flood

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Break upon my praise as I sing of your love

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Holy Spirit fly, burn within my soul

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 As I call on your name

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 As I call on your name

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Drifting visions of the sun

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 As I stand in your presence

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Revelations of your love

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 As I look to the heavens

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Holy Spirit reign, fall in like a flood

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Break upon my praise as I sing of your love

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Holy Spirit fly, burn within my soul

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 As I call on your name

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 As I call on your name

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 As I call on your name

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 As I call on your name

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 As I call on your name

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Holy Spirit fly

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Oh, we call upon your name

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Oh, would you fill our hearts

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Would you fill this place, would you fill our hearts

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Your word brings life, your word brings healing

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Within your presence

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Holy Spirit burn like a fire

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Sing it out, church.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 All Christ's children

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 In your presence

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 All Christ's children

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Oh, we call upon you

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Oh, we call upon you

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Oh, Holy Spirit

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Oh, we call upon you

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Oh, we call upon you

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Oh, we call upon you

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Oh, in your presence

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Lord, I surrender

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 To your glory

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 For yours is the glory

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Living water

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 River wild in me

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 In mercy

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 In your mercy

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Open heaven

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Crashing over me

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Restore me

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 In your glory

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Oh, Holy Spirit

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Burn like a fire

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Oh, come to me

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Come to me

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 In your presence

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Lord, I surrender

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 To your glory

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 To your glory

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Oh, in your mercy

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Oh, in your mercy

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Oh, in your mercy

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Oh, we call upon you

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 We need you, God

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 We need you, Lord

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Sing, Holy Spirit

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Oh, Holy Spirit

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Burn like a fire

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Oh, come to me

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Come to me

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 In your presence

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Lord, I surrender

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 To your glory

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 To your glory

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Holy Spirit, come on

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Holy Spirit, come on

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Meet us where we are

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Thank you for who you are

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Holy Spirit, rain

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Fall in my cup of blood

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Break upon my praise

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 As I sing of your love

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Holy Spirit, fire

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Burn within my soul

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 As I call on you

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 As I call on you

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Would you cry out to Him, too?

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 As I call on you

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Jesus

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 As I call on you

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 In the name of Jesus

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 As I call on you

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Jesus

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 As I call on you

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Jesus

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 As I call on you

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 As I call on you

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 I wonder if you just take a moment

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Just as we've been singing Jesus

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Speaking His name

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 If you just open your hands where you are right now

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 The very last thing that's in the Bible is a simple prayer

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's "Come, Lord Jesus"

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I don't know what's happening in your life right now

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Or what things you're holding

109
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 But there is a power

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 In the name of Jesus

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 So for you this morning

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 As you think about what it is that you're carrying in this time

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Just that simple prayer, "Come, Lord Jesus"

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Come, Lord Jesus, to this area of my life right now that's broken

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Come, Lord Jesus, to this part of my relationship with my spouse

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 That needs healing and renewal

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Come, Lord Jesus, for my business that I want to see go to the next level

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Come, Lord Jesus, in my heart, in my relationship with you

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Whatever is relevant for you, just take a moment to pray that prayer for you

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Just invite the Holy Spirit to come

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Thank you, Jesus

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 So good

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 It's a beautiful thing that Paul writes in the New Testament

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 He says, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel"

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 And as we are worshipping together today

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I felt like the Lord take those words and say them back over us

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And I think this is important for some of you here

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 I felt like God was saying, "I'm not ashamed of you"

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I love you so much

130
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I created you, formed you, shaped you

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 There's nothing that you have done

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 There's nothing that you're currently doing

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And there's nothing that you will do that will cause me to be ashamed of you

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 For I see you through the life, death and resurrection of my son Jesus

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And I love you, you're my beloved

136
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I'm here for you

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I see you

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 I'm not ashamed of you

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Father, I pray you would liberate us from the fear of shame

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Lord, I pray you would liberate us from the things that we think about you that are not true

141
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I pray you would liberate us, Lord

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 From the ways in which we hold ourselves back

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Because we think you think a certain way about us

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Forgive us, release us

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 You are not ashamed of us

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And we are not ashamed of the gospel

147
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 We are not ashamed to carry your name in our city

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 We are not ashamed to speak your name over our workplaces

149
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 We are not ashamed to speak our name over each other as a family

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Because we believe that there is healing, redemption, release and power in your name

151
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 So we say, "Come Lord Jesus"

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 There is no name that is higher than the name of Jesus

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 So we say, "Come Lord Jesus"

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Over every situation and circumstance of family and friendship

155
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Over every marriage, over every home

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Come Lord Jesus

157
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And as we are here on Vision Sunday today

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 We ask you humbly to come again for our church

159
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Father, we need you

160
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Father, we can't do this on our own strength

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Hong Kong is too valuable

162
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 This time in history is too important

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 For us to waste energy in our own strength

164
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Come Holy Spirit and fall on your church in this city

165
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Open our mouths, open our hands

166
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Open our resources

167
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 May we give you glory

168
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 In Jesus

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Everyone says, "Amen"

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Hey, can we just give Jesus honor

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Why don't you turn around and say hi to someone as you sit down

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And say, "Wow, so nice to see you"

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 "Welcome to The Vine"

174
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 "Who are you?"

175
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 "I should get your phone number"

176
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 "No!"

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Well, maybe, I don't know

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Well, welcome to The Vine, my name is Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here

179
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 We're so glad that you are with us

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 If you're new to The Vine, welcome

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 You couldn't have come on a better Sunday

182
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 In the name of Jesus, Amen

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 You could not have come on a better Sunday

184
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Because today is Vision Sunday

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And I'm going to unpack some things for you today

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Whether you're a first timer with us

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Or whether this is a regular place of worship for you

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 That I believe the Lord wants to speak to you

189
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And I want to frame it by taking you back a few years

190
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Starting in March 3rd of 2019

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Sunday, March 3rd, 2019

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Where on that day I stood before you on Vision Sunday

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And I unpacked for you what has come to be known as

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 The River Model Vision for us here at The Vine

195
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 About six months prior to that Sunday

196
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 I was praying about the future of The Vine

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 This is back in 2018

198
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And I felt like God said something very clearly

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 He said, "The way you think about church has to change"

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 "The way that you as a community together think about church needs to change"

201
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 "You need to stop thinking about church as a building"

202
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 "Or using the metaphor of church like a house"

203
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 "And instead start thinking of a church like a river"

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 "You need to start thinking of church more like a flowing river in a city"

205
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 "Rather than a static house planted in the land"

206
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And it was interesting because what God was really saying is

207
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Church, of course, is not a building, it's a people

208
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 And if church is a people, then church happens

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Wherever those people are living out the gospel in their sphere of influence

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And as I prayed and was receiving this

211
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 I saw this vision of a river flowing in a nation

212
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 I want to show you a picture of what I saw

213
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I literally saw that in my prayer time

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 That's actually the Amazon River flowing in the basin of Brazil

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And God said, "This is what I have on my heart for the church"

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 "I want the church to be like a river flowing in its city"

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 "Bring the hope of the gospel to all the dry and weary parched lands"

218
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 And if you think about the church as just one static location

219
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And you expect everybody to come to you

220
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 You're not actually going to have impact in your city

221
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 The church has to be outwards, flowing outwards

222
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Every single person in this room has a sphere of influence where the gospel matters

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 A sphere of influence where Jesus matters

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And God was saying, "We need to shift"

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Now, I don't know if you can think how incredibly prophetic this call was on us as a church

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Literally at the start of 2019

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Just months away from when the plug fell out of the whole world

228
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And everything turned upside down

229
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 For us here in Hong Kong, we had a year before everybody else suffered

230
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 We had a year of the social movement which turned everything upside down in our city

231
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And then right off the back of that, COVID came

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And we had that for the last two and a half to three years

233
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And just before all of that happened, before a long season

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Where for many Sundays, we literally had to close our physical gatherings

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 God showed up before that and said, "The church is not a physical gathering"

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 That there is this thing that when we come together, life happens and we love it

237
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 But if you close a physical gathering, you are not closing the physical and spiritual movement of the gospel in a city

238
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Are you with me?

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Like you can close the doors of a building, but you cannot close the door of the human heart

240
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And we began to think that if church is this way

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Then actually when all the stuff that happened during the process and during COVID came

242
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 I think we were incredibly placed to be able to get in the flow differently

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 And God is saying, "This is how you must continue to be"

244
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Because there are challenges ahead of us

245
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 There are going to be some things ahead of us here in our city that we are not yet aware of

246
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Perhaps we are not even prepared for yet

247
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And yet if we continue to think about ourselves as a church that flows and moves forward

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 We will begin to really believe that we can bless our city

249
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And we had this incredible vision of what it would be like if the vine that gathers in one chai

250
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Actually spread out and started connecting throughout our whole city

251
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 That we might actually see this place truly changed with the power of the gospel

252
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Amen?

253
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Amen?

254
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Come on church, stay with me

255
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 So today I want to talk to you about movement

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 I want to talk to you about flow

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Because one of the greatest strategies I think the enemy has against his church

258
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Is to stop it flowing and moving forward

259
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Rivers, by their very definition, are things that always move forward

260
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 In fact, if you take a river and you stop its forward momentum

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 If you stop its forward flow, it no longer is a river anymore

262
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And it gets named by something else, it gets called a lake

263
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 I want to be really clear, God has not given us a lake model vision here at the vine

264
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 He's given us a river model vision

265
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And if it's a river model vision, what that means is we need to be moving forward

266
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 We need to be progressing and flowing by His Holy Spirit in the land that we're planted in

267
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Now rivers flow simply by rain falling in higher elevations

268
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And the water then either seeping into the ground and joining and forming there

269
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Or in the runoff on the top of the surface of the ground

270
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Flowing from a higher elevation to a lower elevation and eventually out into the sea

271
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 That's how rivers actually flow

272
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Now here's the incredible thing

273
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Rivers very rarely flow in a straight line

274
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 And oh my goodness, the last four years has not been a straight line

275
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 But here's the great thing about thinking about a church like a river and not a building

276
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Because when obstacles come in your path

277
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 When the land around you changes

278
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Rivers are able to adapt to the contour of the land in which they're planted in

279
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Have you ever noticed that a river can sometimes flow around the stones and the rocks around it?

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Rivers have this amazing ability to weave and flow and fit to the contour of their land

281
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And if there's anything we've had to do over the last four years

282
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Surely it's had to be flexible to move

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 When our land puts an obstacle in its way

284
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 We as a church need to make sure we can continue to flow around it

285
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 That no obstacles create boundaries that turn the church into a lake

286
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Because lakes become stagnant

287
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 But the church is meant to be alive

288
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 There are two things that impact the flow of a river

289
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 These two things impact the speed and the power within which a river flows

290
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 These are friction and gravity

291
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Friction impacts the speed of a river

292
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Gravity impacts the power that that river has

293
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Let me unpack both of these real quick for you

294
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 See, friction takes place in a river when there are stones or rocks placed within it

295
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Or when sediment builds up inside of it

296
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 That weighs it down and stops it from flowing really fast

297
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And I think if we're honest with ourselves

298
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 We've had some pretty large stones placed in the rivers here in Hong Kong

299
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 In the church in the last three or four years

300
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And those things do have the power to create friction in us

301
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 I think if we're honest with ourselves

302
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 There has been a lot of friction amongst us

303
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 A lot of friction in our families over the last three to four years

304
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Particularly during the social movement

305
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 There was a lot of friction politically in our city

306
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Which created breakdowns in relationships

307
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Some really valuable and important relationships were placed in great friction because of that

308
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And I think if we're honest with ourselves

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 It was also here at the church too

310
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 There were times over the last three to four years

311
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Where friction, not just with the social movement

312
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 But with COVID as well

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 With government policies and procedures

314
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Some that we agreed with perhaps

315
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Some that we didn't agree with

316
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Navigating the tensions and the frustrations in the midst of all of that

317
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Has indeed created frictions even within our own relationships here at the church

318
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And any time there's friction, the church will slow down

319
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Sediment is also important

320
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 See, sediment in a river is the buildup of soil or dirt

321
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Or small little pebbles that are found in the river

322
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And if sediment builds up enough

323
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It becomes like a sludge within the river itself

324
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And the weight of that slows again the flow of the river

325
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And I think for us, there's been sediment at work around us as well

326
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 That's the emotional things that we've been carrying in the last three to four years

327
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 The fact that some of that emotional stuff is still wearing down on us

328
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 The fact that we've had some challenges in the area of our mental health in the last three to four years

329
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 We've carried on stress

330
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 And some of us have even felt traumatized through what has happened over this time period

331
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And that's like the sediment that's found in a river

332
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And unless a river is able to drain that sediment away

333
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 It will slow down the flow of it naturally

334
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And I think in the same way, God is challenging us as a church

335
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 If we really want to flow in 2023

336
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Not only do we need to deal with the frictions that are there in our relationships

337
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 We also must deal with the releasing of the sediment that is built up inside of our spirits

338
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Inside of our emotions, even inside of our minds

339
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And try to find ways of getting rid of that

340
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So that we can flow in the way that God calls us to

341
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 This is why from next Sunday onwards for four weeks

342
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 I'm going to do a series here with you called "When the Journey is Too Much"

343
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And we're going to talk about mental health and mental wellness

344
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 We're going to take a look at the Apostle Paul and the Prophet Elijah

345
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And we're going to look at the ways in which sediment built up for them

346
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And how they were able to release the sediment in their lives

347
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 So they could continue to flow in the ministry God had called them to

348
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And my prayer for you over those weeks is that you would be able to release

349
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Some of the sediment that may have built up for you

350
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 That's friction, okay?

351
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 But here's the other bit

352
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Friction slows down the speed of a river

353
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 It's gravity that impacts the power of a river

354
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Gravity is this amazing thing

355
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 It's an unseen force

356
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 But it's powerful to literally pull that water from a higher elevation

357
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Down to a lower elevation

358
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And eventually out into the sea

359
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 It is gravity that works upon the water

360
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 To move it from one place to another

361
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 To literally pull it down towards its exit point in the ocean

362
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And if that's the reality of gravity and what it does to the flow of a river

363
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And if God is speaking to us still that the vine is not to be a building but a river

364
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Then here's the key question we need to keep asking ourselves

365
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 What is the gravity that God is using upon us

366
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 To ensure that we continue to flow and move more and more

367
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Towards the vast ocean of his kingdom in Hong Kong

368
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Are you with me still?

369
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 What is the gravity for us that's going to move this thing forward

370
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 That's going to pull the vine into the right direction as we move forward

371
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Today in this talk I want to give you an answer to that question

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And as I do so

373
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Let me start by telling you about some of the forward momentum

374
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 That I feel God has got for us this year

375
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 One of the key ways that we're moving forward and flowing in the river this year

376
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Is of course through our church plant in Yuen Long

377
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And Yuen Long are watching this right now

378
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 They're gathering in their temporary space in a kindergarten in Yuen Long

379
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Pastor Tim and Pastor Ivan are there right now

380
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And I'm going to look into this camera

381
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 You're all going to turn and look into the camera

382
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 And you're going to wave and say, "Hey, Yuen Long, you guys are awesome

383
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 We miss you, we love you, we're so glad you're a part of this."

384
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Yes

385
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 So we've already launched our church there

386
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Meeting in this temporary space

387
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 As we get ourselves ready to formally launch the church

388
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Towards the summer of this year

389
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And last year at Vision Sunday

390
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 We invited each one of you to give towards the operating expenses of the church for one year

391
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And you guys gave over $7 million last year

392
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 So that we could get that church up and running

393
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Cover their operational expenditure for one year

394
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Which takes the whole pressure off Tim and Ivan

395
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 They can pass to that church without having to worry about that income coming in for that first year

396
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And that was an incredible blessing for them

397
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 But this year, we're in a situation now

398
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Where we've got this project manager who's helping us find a location there

399
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 We've got an attended environment where they've come up with designs

400
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 For what our church premises will look like

401
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And this year on Vision Sunday, today

402
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I'm inviting you to raise $6.5 million

403
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 And that $6.5 million is what we need to be able to renovate a venue in Yuen Long

404
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 So that we can hopefully formally launch our services in the summer of this year

405
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 So that's the ask today

406
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 I'm putting that right up front and I hope that's okay

407
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 You should never feel ashamed to ask people to give to something you're passionate about

408
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 So we're looking for $6.5 million for the fit out of a premises in Yuen Long

409
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But Yuen Long's not the only way we're flowing this year

410
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 There are some other things that we're also doing

411
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And we're excited about these as well

412
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I mentioned about the sediment earlier

413
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Well this is something that we're leaning into as a church

414
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Because God has always called the Vine to be a place of healing and restoration

415
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 And so we're helping to process some of that sediment in us this year

416
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 By making some investments in some areas where we can do that

417
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 So you know that we have a counselling centre here at the Vine called Oasis

418
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 It's our centre of counselling and psychotherapy

419
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 We're going to be further investing into that this year

420
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Helping to grow the team there

421
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And begin to really serve the mental health need that there is in Hong Kong in this time

422
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And one of the things that I'm really happy to let you know

423
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Is that now Oasis is actually ministering to around 80% people who are not part of the Vine

424
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And this is something we've always wanted with this ministry

425
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 We've not wanted it just to help serve us, although that's important

426
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 But we wanted to serve the city

427
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And now 80% of their clients actually do not attend the Vine

428
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And they're just out there in the city somewhere

429
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And that is awesome

430
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 We're also going to be shifting into some new ministries here at the Vine this year

431
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And one of those areas is in the area of inner healing

432
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 We're having one of our pastors move into a new role

433
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Where they're going to be like a restoration pastor for us

434
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And helping us to just lean into courses and ministry

435
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 And various prayer ministry

436
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 To really help people to let go of some of that built up sediment

437
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 That's happened in their lives over the last three to four years

438
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 We want to put resources into that space so we can flow well

439
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And one of the other important things is you come out of something like COVID

440
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 As we're emerging, no masks today or maybe masks

441
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 It depends on how you're feeling

442
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And that's freedom to be however you want to be

443
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 But what's amazing is we're emerging out of COVID

444
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Is that we also need to find community again with one another

445
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And so our community groups, our ways in which we want to connect

446
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 To the various communities at this church

447
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Is going to increase this year

448
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And you would have noticed already, you've been coming to the Vine for a little while

449
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 That we started some new initiatives to try to connect people on Sundays

450
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And help them to be a part of this church and not be anonymous

451
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 That's going to continue throughout the year

452
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 We're also investing in our generations ministries

453
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Our kids, youth and young adults

454
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Because we believe family is so important

455
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Particularly again in this time of emerging out of the crisis that we've been in

456
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Family, strengthening family, working with families, incredibly important

457
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Our missions work

458
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 We're now moving out into our neighbourhoods much more than we've done before

459
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 As well as the pathways that we do here throughout the year

460
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 We're also creating initiatives for you to get involved

461
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 In really understanding the neighbourhood better

462
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 We call these neighbourhood conversations

463
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 We've been talking about these over the last number of weeks

464
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 We've had some incredible connection points

465
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 With people here in Wan Chai

466
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Learning about how they're doing

467
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Understanding the small businesses in our environment

468
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 So that we can be a blessing to those that actually are living around

469
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Where this part of the river is currently flowing

470
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Does that sound good?

471
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So those are some of the things that we're doing

472
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 But I actually don't want to take a lot of time today

473
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Telling you about all the things that we're going to do

474
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And there's a very important reason for that

475
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Because normally here on Vision Sunday

476
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 What I do is I kind of use the whole message

477
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 To unpack all the great and exciting stuff we do

478
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And then invite you to give towards that

479
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 But about two months ago

480
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 As I was praying for today

481
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 I felt God give me a very strong word

482
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 It was actually a word for me personally

483
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 And it was a word of rebuke

484
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Now when God speaks a word of rebuke to you

485
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Two things happen

486
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 One is "Ugh, no!"

487
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 The other is "You're set free"

488
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 And so when God spoke this word to me

489
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 It was difficult

490
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 But now I believe I'm standing before you

491
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Two months later set free

492
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And I want to unpack a little bit about what God said to me

493
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Because I think it's also something

494
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 He might be saying to more of us in this room as well

495
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 I was on this walk

496
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 You guys know that I receive prayer when I walk

497
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 So I was on this walk in Hong Kong in the hills

498
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Beautiful hike

499
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And as God began to speak to me

500
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 He said "Andrew, in this season of the vine I'm doing a new thing"

501
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And that's something we've lent into

502
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 In the last couple of months

503
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 As we opened up this new year

504
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 We looked at Isaiah 40 to 55

505
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And the whole new thing that God does there

506
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 And God was saying "I'm doing a new thing, Andrew

507
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 So I want you to do a new thing on Vision Sunday"

508
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And He said "I need you to understand, Andrew

509
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 That there's something going on in your life

510
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 That is actually stopping the flow of the river at the vine

511
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 That I want to do"

512
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Now when you're the senior pastor of the church

513
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And God shows up and says "You're the problem"

514
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 That's a sobering thing to hear, right?

515
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 But I felt like God was saying

516
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 "Andrew, there's something in you that's stopping the flow

517
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And I need you to do something different on Vision Sunday"

518
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 I realised that I had come

519
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Over the many years that we've done Vision Sunday here

520
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 That I had come to understand or think

521
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 That the gravity that moves the vine forward

522
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Is a really well and articulated vision

523
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 I had come to convince myself

524
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 That the thing that's moving us forward

525
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 The gravity, if you will, that moves us from one location to the next

526
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Moves us forward

527
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Is a really well articulated vision to you

528
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Now I want you to be clear about something

529
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Vision, of course, is not wrong

530
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Vision is great, vision is needed

531
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 The Bible even says "Without a vision people perish"

532
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And I don't want you to perish

533
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 So we're going to keep talking about vision at the vine

534
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Vision is a part of who we are

535
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 This day is still called Vision Sunday

536
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 But I also need you to hear this

537
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And this is what I needed to hear by the Holy Spirit

538
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I had come to think

539
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 That the way this thing moves forward

540
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 This idea of church

541
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 It moves forward through my ability

542
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 To discern what God is saying to us

543
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 And then my ability to stand in front of you on a particular Sunday

544
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And communicate what God is doing

545
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And do it, hopefully, in such a clear and articulate way

546
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 That you rationally hear it

547
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And go "Oh, that sounds like a worthy financial investment"

548
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 I want to be honest with you

549
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 I think there are some Vision Sundays in the past

550
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Maybe not all, but some

551
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Where I approach it a bit like an investment strategy

552
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 We're in Hong Kong, after all

553
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And I thought, well, if I could just get up there on a Sunday

554
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 And give you a rational reason

555
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Why you should give, not only that

556
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 But as you give, show you that you're going to have a positive rate of return on your investment

557
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Then you're more likely to give

558
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And so I began to think that the gravity was down to me

559
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 That the gravity was down to how I speak the vision

560
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 And the gravity was like some sort of investment strategy

561
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 That hopefully convinces you to rationally give to this church

562
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Now I want to say this, because this is really important

563
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 So much of the giving in Scripture is actually irrational

564
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Come on, church

565
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 So much of the giving that we actually see in Scripture is actually irrational

566
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 In fact, there is an element of irrationality in the giving experienced in God's kingdom

567
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Now by irrationality, I'm not saying it's giving done without any thoughts

568
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 I'm not saying it's giving done without any kind of reflection, no

569
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 In fact, the irrational giving in Scripture comes with a lot of reflection

570
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 A lot of thinking

571
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 In fact, that's why people respond in that way

572
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 What I mean by irrational giving is not that it's not done with thought or care or reflection

573
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 It's done by a different barometer for success

574
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 And a different reason to give it than how the world might encourage us to give like in an investment

575
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 In other words, it actually becomes much more something that is faithful and true to the kingdom

576
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Even if it looks irrational to the world

577
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Is anybody still here?

578
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Are you okay, upper house?

579
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 You alive?

580
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Give me a wave

581
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Ah

582
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 The fact that you're sitting in the upper house right now

583
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And the fact that you're sitting here in the lower house right now

584
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Is because there are a group of crazy Christians 12 years ago who were irrational

585
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Come on, church

586
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 You see, this used to be a dilapidated porn theater

587
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 It was

588
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 It was a dilapidated porn theater

589
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And it had been like that for 10 years

590
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 And nobody was mad enough to make an investment in this building

591
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And in fact, many people had come to think about investing here

592
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 But because you can't actually build on top of it, it was a poor investment for people

593
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 So we showed up to our landlord and we said, "Well, we don't want to build upwards

594
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 We want to actually just use this facility for this thing that we've got

595
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 It's the idea of the kingdom of God

596
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Can we tell you about this?"

597
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And it was kind of crazy

598
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And then we started to go to the church and everybody thought we were mad

599
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 They were like, "You don't own the building

600
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 You're going to put how much money and build a building that you don't actually own

601
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 You're putting all this money into somebody else's pocket

602
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 That's not a rational, financial, sound act to do

603
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Like, why would you do that?"

604
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 And so many people thought we were mad

605
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 And we're now sitting in the reality of the irrationality of some giving of a previous generation

606
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Because they didn't give based on some sound financial plan

607
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 They gave based on something else

608
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Are you with me still?

609
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 And the question is, what is it that they gave from?

610
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 What was the gravity that enabled them to open up their hands

611
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 So that you would be the beneficiaries of it today?

612
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And I wonder whether you might be willing to open your hands

613
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 So there might be some beneficiaries of it tomorrow

614
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 What is it that was the gravity that really moves a church forward?

615
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Well, to help you understand that, I want to actually go to a moment in Scripture

616
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 That is completely irrational in its giving

617
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 It's perhaps one of the most famous moments in Scripture where there's giving encountered for

618
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And it's found in the book of Exodus

619
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 And before I go into the Scripture, I'm so excited

620
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 You know, I've been working for about four years on our Exodus sermon series

621
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 We've traveled to Egypt, we've gone to Jordan, we've filmed all the stuff that we want to film

622
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 So that series is starting the Sunday after Easter

623
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 So that's April 16th, right here

624
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 We're going to begin our Exodus sermon series

625
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 If there was ever a series to invite your friends and family to, it's this one

626
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Every Sunday we have little films that we'll be showing each week

627
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 I'm really excited about it

628
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 That's enough of a plug in Jesus' name, everyone says, Amen

629
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 But I want to go to the book of Exodus together today to this moment in chapter 36

630
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And the reason why we're going there is because there is this moment of irrationality that happens

631
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 That is so beautiful and so kingdom

632
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Now, before we read it, let me give you some of the background

633
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 So, Egypt has come out of their slavery

634
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 God has delivered them into freedom

635
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 And they're now in this desert, wandering around before they go into the promised land

636
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 And as they're wandering around the desert, they want to construct a place

637
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Where God's presence could be with them

638
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 They're still nomadic at this time, which meant they were moving around all the time

639
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 So rather than build a temple, which would come much later in the promised land

640
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 Now they build a tent

641
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 It's known as the tent of tabernacle, the tent of meeting

642
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And Moses comes before the people and he says, we're going to make this tent

643
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 And it's going to be amazing

644
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 And I want you to participate in your giving

645
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 So that we can construct this tent

646
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 So this is a building project in scripture

647
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 I want you to see what happens here from verse 2

648
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 "Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Ohaleb and every skilled person to whom the Lord had given ability

649
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 And who was willing to come and do the work

650
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary

651
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 And the people continued to bring free will offerings morning after morning

652
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 So all the skilled craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary

653
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Left their work behind them and said to Moses, the people are bringing more than enough

654
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Notice this, more than enough for doing the work the Lord commanded to be done

655
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Then Moses gave an order and his word was sent throughout the camp

656
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary

657
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 And so the people were restrained from bringing more

658
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Because they had already had more than enough to do all the work

659
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 This blows my mind

660
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 I mean, just track with what's happening here in this moment

661
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Moses has gone out and invited people to give to a building project

662
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 He said we want to put this tabernacle together, this tent together

663
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 And we would love for you to be a part of that

664
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And so many people have responded

665
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 So many people were giving that the workmen who were constructing the tabernacle

666
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 Had to put their tools down because they were so overwhelmed dealing with the offerings that were coming in

667
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 And they put their tools down and they go to Moses and they say, Moses, you need to make an announcement

668
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 You need to stop people from giving because we have already more than enough that we need

669
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 And so Moses, perhaps the first and perhaps maybe only ever Christian leader

670
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Has gone in front of his people and he said, stop giving

671
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Imagine that

672
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Imagine if I came to you next week after Vision Sunday and said, stop giving

673
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 You've given too much church

674
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 I don't know what to do with it

675
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 I'm going to do my normal pastoral job because I'm counting all the money

676
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 That's what's happening here

677
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 The word used here, restrained from bringing more

678
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Is a word in the Hebrew that means to physically stop someone

679
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 It was literally like the people were putting hands on people, stopping them from coming forward

680
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Because they were so excited to give

681
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 And when we see this, we have to ask ourselves the question, what is going on here?

682
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 I mean, this is irrational

683
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 What is the gravity that's causing these people to want to give in such a way?

684
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Well, to understand that, we jump back to chapter 35 where Moses explains the start of the project

685
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 35 verse 4 says this

686
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 Moses said to the whole Israelite community, this is what the Lord has commanded

687
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 From what you have, notice this, from what you have, take a portion, an offering for the Lord

688
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Everyone who is willing is to bring to the Lord an offering of gold, silver and bronze

689
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red

690
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 Heights of sea cows, no idea what a sea cow is, but anyway

691
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Acacia wood, olive oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense

692
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 And onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breast pieces

693
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 In other words, he goes to them and he doesn't shy away from telling them what to give

694
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 In the same way that I'm happy to stand before you today and say we need 6.5 million dollars

695
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 And I love what Moses does here, he tells them what to give but he makes this big long list

696
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 And some things on this list only very wealthy people would be able to bring

697
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 But there are other things on this list that all the common people would also have been able to bring

698
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 In other words, what Moses is doing is he's creating an environment where everybody can contribute

699
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Where it's not, hey we're only looking for this

700
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 He's saying no matter your situation in life, no matter where you're coming from

701
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 No matter how much your household might have right now

702
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Everybody has the opportunity to be a part of this building project

703
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 And he creates the space for that

704
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 And that's something we always do here at The Vine too, like everybody has the opportunity

705
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 What's important to us is the communal act of giving rather than exactly what is given

706
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 The fact that we do it all together and we all have the opportunity to do it together is the beautiful thing

707
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Now I want you to see one thing that Moses says here at the start

708
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 He says everyone who is willing

709
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 Now this is so important, in fact there's five times in chapter 35 alone

710
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Where Moses mentions those who were willing

711
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Those who were willing brought this, those that were willing brought that

712
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Why is he emphasizing this?

713
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Because he's speaking to his people about freedom

714
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 People were not obligated, they were not coerced, they were not forced to give

715
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 They were totally free to give if they wanted to give

716
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 It was the willing who responded and stepped up to give

717
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 And there were so many who were doing that that they actually had to stop them from giving in the end

718
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 But Moses is making an important point here, he's saying the willing get to be a part of this

719
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Now this is so important that you track with this

720
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 Why do you think it's important that Moses is emphasizing freedom in this building project and in the act of giving?

721
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Well remember the Israelites had been slaves for 430 years

722
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And when you're a slave there are two things that are the reality

723
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Number one, you don't own anything

724
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Number two, you have no freedom

725
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 And Moses understood if he came to his people and he said you're obligated to give

726
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 If you're going to be a part of this community, well then you have to give

727
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 And if you don't give, you're out of this community

728
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Then he's just enslaving his people once again

729
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 So he basically says you are free to do this however you want

730
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 In fact I want to read to you verse 29 of the end of chapter 20, 35

731
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 It says all the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the Lord free will offerings

732
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 For all the work the Lord had through Moses commanded to be done

733
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 They are willing and they are free to do whatever they want

734
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 And Moses is emphasizing the freedom because he does not want to enslave his people

735
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 But I also want you to recognize something

736
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 Israel had been slaves

737
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 And God in his love and compassion saw them in their slavery

738
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 Said that's not right for my people

739
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 And through miracle after miracle came down, set his people free, delivered them

740
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 And he's in the process of taking them towards the promised land

741
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 So these are a group of people who just 20 years beforehand

742
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 God had shown up and done a miraculous thing for them

743
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 God showed up and said your freedom matters to me

744
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 God showed up and said in love I'm going to change your situation

745
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 God showed up and said your slavery and your oppression is not right

746
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 And so God changed it out of his place of love

747
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 And there is this connection between love and freedom

748
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 And so then Moses comes and he says we have this building project

749
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 But I'm not going to coerce you, I'm not going to obligate you

750
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 I'm not going to slave you into something here

751
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 I'm just literally going to say you are free to respond however you want to respond

752
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 And they responded so much that Moses had to tell them to stop giving

753
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 Why did they respond so much?

754
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 Because they were people who knew that it was the love of God that had set them free

755
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And when an opportunity came for them to show their gratitude

756
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 To a God who has set them free, they jumped on it

757
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 And remember, these are not wealthy people

758
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Because they've been slaves for 430 years

759
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 And yes, when they came out of Egypt, they brought some of the gold and some things with them

760
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 But these are a poor group of people

761
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 The sound financial decision making for a family in Israel at this time would have been not to give

762
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 Well we just need to save up for our family

763
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Man, we've had long hard years of slavery

764
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 We haven't earned anything for years

765
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 And now we're finally beginning to get some wealth for our family

766
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 Little Bobby needs to go to university in a few years time

767
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 And we're just going to put some money aside and we're going to do all this

768
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 Now, don't get me wrong, stewardship of our resources is very important

769
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 But it blows my mind that these people have every excuse not to give, but they give

770
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 And they give so much that Moses has to tell them to stop

771
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 Why? Because they are a people who have encountered the love of God and it has changed them

772
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 They give not because of some great vision

773
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 They give not because it's some sound financial decision

774
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 The reason why they give, the only reason they give, is from love

775
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 God has changed me

776
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 I am now free to honour him in any way I can for the change that he has made in me

777
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 See, love and love alone is the gravity that moves God's river forward in the kingdom of his city

778
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 Love

779
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 And I had for a number of years thought it was vision

780
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Thought it was a way of telling you a good investment to make

781
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 And this is why today I'm not unpacking all the things that we've got planned to do this year

782
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 Although we've got a lot of things planned

783
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 I'm literally just coming to you and saying

784
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 I wonder if you, like me, have struggled somewhat

785
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 And we need to get back to the heart of the matter

786
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 And the heart of the matter is

787
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 I want you to give out love today

788
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 You're free, completely

789
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 Whether you want to respond or not

790
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 And in a bit of a moment's time we're going to do that together

791
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 You're free to do whatever you want

792
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 But I do not want you to give into something

793
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 I want you to give out of something

794
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 I'm going to say that again, so important church

795
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 I do not want you to give into something today

796
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 I do not want you to give into vision

797
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 I want you to give out of love

798
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 The Israelites did not give into vision

799
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 They gave out of love

800
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 And I believe that's the way that God always moves His church forward

801
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 It is a group of people saying, "God has changed me

802
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 How can I not do something now to express my gratitude

803
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 And my own love in freedom for somebody else?"

804
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 And you need to know in this room that God loves you

805
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 Just like He loved the Israelites

806
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 In fact, it says in that most famous of our verses

807
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 That God so loved the world that He gave

808
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 And that maybe our response in that is to say

809
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 We so love our city

810
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 We so love the brokenness here and wanting to see it change

811
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 We so love the darkness and wanting to see it overcome with light

812
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 We so love the reality of what God's doing amongst us

813
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 That we're like God, willing to give of the most precious things

814
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 So that His love would actually find root in our city

815
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 That we would give out of something

816
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 Rather than giving in to something

817
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 When you give in to something, you're often wondering, "What's your return?"

818
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 Oh, I'm going to say this, not my notes, but it's good

819
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 When you give in to something, you're always thinking, "What's my return?"

820
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 When you give out of something, you let it go

821
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 Wouldn't it be amazing if we gave just to let it go?

822
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 Just to trust that God knows what He's doing

823
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 I want to finish by just highlighting one thing here

824
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 Which I think is really important

825
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 It says, "Those who were willing gave"

826
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 I want you to know that God changes the world

827
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 Not through those who are obligated or coerced

828
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 God changes the world through those who are willing

829
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 That's the way God works, by those who are willing

830
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 I love that Moses emphasises this reality of the willing

831
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 Because it says something important to us

832
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 It says that there were people in Israel who were not willing

833
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 He doesn't say, "All of Israel gave"

834
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 And it wasn't like this big celebration that everybody in Israel gave

835
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 No, he said, "Those that were willing gave"

836
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 Which implies that there were some within Israel that weren't willing

837
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 And here's the really thing that blows my mind

838
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 Those who were not willing would still go on to receive the benefits

839
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 Of the future that was created by those who were willing

840
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 In other words, God does not go, "There's second class citizens here"

841
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 It wasn't like Moses later on said, "Hey, if you gave, you get the first entrance to the tabernacle

842
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 And if you didn't give, then you can only come back on Thursday at 2 o'clock"

843
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 It wasn't like Moses sorted out between those who were willing and those who weren't

844
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 Whether they were willing or they weren't

845
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 They were always going to be swept up in what God does

846
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 That's the way God always works

847
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 Whether you give today or not, you're going to be swept up

848
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 In all of the things that we do here at the Vine and all the ministry of the God

849
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 We're never going to judge

850
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 I'm not going to know who's given and who's not given

851
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 It doesn't work that way

852
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 It's kind of irrational

853
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 Come on, church

854
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 It's kind of irrational

855
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 That those who give, and many of you in this room have given over the years

856
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 Incredibly sacrificially

857
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 And those that don't give experience the same thing

858
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 It would be those who were willing

859
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 Who would shape the future in Israel for those who were not

860
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 And those that were not would still benefit from it

861
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 And it will be the same for us

862
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 I said earlier that you're sitting in a room right now

863
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 That those who were willing before gave towards

864
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 And I wonder in the future

865
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 What rooms some generations in 10, 15, 20 years will be sitting in

866
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 Because of the willing in this room right now

867
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 Whether you give or not today

868
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 You're free to respond no matter how God leads you

869
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 But it will be the willing amongst us

870
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 Who get the joy of participating in building the future of tomorrow

871
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 My prayer for you is that you, like me, would go through a regeneration of your spirit

872
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 That you would realize that sometimes we've made this whole giving thing more complicated than it really is

873
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 That while vision is important and stewardship of our finances are important

874
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 They are never the gravity that decides whether we give or not

875
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 The reason we give is because God loved us

876
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 And because he so loved us, he sent his son Jesus

877
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 And in the freedom that we now have in Jesus

878
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 We are free to be a part of the willing

879
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 Who shape the future of Hong Kong for the generations that come

880
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 That's the joy, that's the invitation

881
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 And that's how I want you to respond today

882
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 I wonder whether you would stand with me

883
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 And we're going to do a couple of things together

884
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 As we stand together, you'll notice that there are buckets around this room

885
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 There's a couple of baskets here, just in the corners here

886
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 There's a couple of baskets in the corners over here as well

887
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 In the upper house, there's some baskets at the front and some baskets at the back

888
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 As you came in today, you would have received an envelope

889
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 And in that envelope is an opportunity for you today, if you want to, to give through your envelope

890
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 You can write a check, put some cash in there

891
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 You can fill in your credit card details and the amount that you want to give

892
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 However you want to do that, you can use your envelope for that

893
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 And then over the next five minutes, as we're worshipping

894
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 You're going to be free to respond however you want

895
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 And those that would like to give in this room

896
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 You'll have an opportunity to do that as we worship together

897
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 And you can drop off those envelopes in the baskets

898
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 Also, if you would like to give by credit card directly today

899
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 We have a team from our finance department who are outside right here on the second floor

900
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 And they are really nice people

901
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 And I'm praying they're going to be very busy and tired by the end of the day

902
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 But you have an opportunity, if you want to give by credit card

903
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
 To go and meet with them and they will process your credit card payment

904
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 That can happen also over the next five or so minutes as we're worshipping

905
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 Also on the screen behind me, for those that want to give digitally

906
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 Because that's a big thing right now, many of us are giving that way

907
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 We'll put the QR codes on the screens as we worship

908
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 So that you can give that way

909
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 This five minutes or so that we're now going to worship

910
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 Is a time for you to truly be free

911
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 If you want to partake in the offering today

912
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 I encourage you to do it in the next five minutes

913
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 If you don't, that's perfectly fine as well

914
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 None of us are going to be looking around, there's no judgement, no nothing like that

915
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 You are free to be willing to give

916
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 And as we do that, we get to do that in a spirit of worship together

917
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 And then at the end of that, I'm going to come back

918
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 And we're going to close our time together

919
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 With the most important thing we're going to do today

920
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 Which is communion

921
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 As we come around the ultimate symbol of love

922
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 As right now we give from that place of love

923
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 So five minutes or so, enjoy your time of giving and worship

924
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 And then after that, I'll come and close our service with communion

925
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,340
