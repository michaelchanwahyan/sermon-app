[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   I am so pleased to be with you this morning.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.720]   I get to do two of my favorite things at the same time.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.280]   And the first is to be here in Vainiung Long.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.080]   Sandra and I really, I mean really, really love this church.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:29.820]   And the second is to have the opportunity to preach from the Book of Acts.
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.560]   And especially the second chapter.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:41.880]   Acts 2 is a powerful chapter that introduces the Holy Spirit's dynamic presence in the
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.080]   life of believers and demonstrates the transformation it brings.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:57.840]   In this pivotal passage we witness the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the disciples.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:09.040]   A moment that serves as the essential catalyst for Christian community formation.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.240]   And what word do we commonly use for Christian community?
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.940]   Yes, the word church.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.400]   Going back to some of the words we sang earlier in the song King of Kings.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.240]   I put them on the screen.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:33.400]   And the church of Christ was born and the Spirit lit the flame.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:43.280]   These 13 words spell out exactly the message I want to bring you this morning.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.160]   And the church of Christ was born and the Spirit lit the flame.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:58.120]   I am so glad to have the opportunity to preach on this passage in Acts 2.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.200]   As what we will see is that the church community as we know it today is a direct result, a
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.020]   consequence of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.920]   I'm also glad that to allow me to preach on Acts chapter 2 that you had Elder Deborah
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.760]   preach on chapter 1 last week.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.800]   I particularly love the toothpaste illustration.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:40.880]   What Deborah told us that Acts chapter 1 was all about waiting.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:50.420]   The disciples were told, "Wait for the promise of the Holy Spirit."
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.900]   It was also about preparing.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.720]   But the key to the formation of the Christian community that we call church is right there
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.600]   in chapter 2 verse 1.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.020]   Look at it.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.260]   When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.400]   I want to spend a little time, more than a little time on this one verse.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   Let's look at that expression, "all together in one place."
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.660]   In its original Greek form is homophumed.
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:40.860]   Now homophumed is a Greek word meaning with one mind, with one accord.
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:49.060]   It signifies a state of unity, harmony and shared passion amongst a group of people.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.540]   In fact it absolutely 100% represents the picture you had of the building blocks.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.140]   Homophumed is a combination of two Greek words.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:10.820]   Homos which means same and thumos, passion, emotion.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:20.460]   It signifies and suggests a group acting with a shared passion and a shared purpose.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:31.820]   Therefore homophumed is used to describe the disciples being in one place, both physically
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.540]   and spiritually.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:44.380]   Homophumed represents a powerful expression of Christian community where individuals are
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:53.540]   bound together by shared faith and purpose, striving towards a common goal.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:01.900]   It emphasises the importance of unity and harmony within the body of Christ.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:13.460]   Church, the good news is that we are already united through the body and blood of Jesus
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.620]   Christ, wonderfully similarised every time we take communion.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:29.020]   But vineyard long, vineyard long, I'm not here today to tickle your ears.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.060]   I'm not even here today to preach a good sermon.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.660]   I am calling you today as a precursor to receiving the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.780]   I am calling you to oneness.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.060]   If we are to fulfil our call to be a relevant Christian community, if we are to fulfil our
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:04.300]   dream, our vision to explore uncharted territories, we need to be one.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.940]   I want to remind you what the Apostle Paul says in Ephesians.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.220]   You've heard me say this before.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.020]   There is one body and one spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.500]   called.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.900]   One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.140]   all and in all.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:45.100]   Today, today my friends, we will see what happened as a consequence of being one.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.460]   In short, they received the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:58.780]   And church, we need to receive.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.700]   We need to receive.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.300]   Let me explain.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.060]   Let's assume today I was to write you a cheque.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.340]   You remember cheques?
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:21.820]   I write you a cheque for a million dollars, but it always stays in my hand.
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.820]   It's useless.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:30.020]   Oh yeah, you can talk about the amazing million dollar cheque.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.540]   Have deep philosophical and theological questions about why I would choose to write you such
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.900]   a cheque.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:47.700]   But you have to receive it and put it in your own account.
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.900]   Now I forgot to say, pray like mad that it doesn't bounce.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.020]   But somehow that explodes the illustration.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:03.060]   And so after last week's message on waiting, I'm going to be talking about and praying
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.180]   for receiving.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.620]   Let's look at this again.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.020]   When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:19.780]   Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.420]   house where they were sitting.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:27.460]   They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.380]   them.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:40.300]   All of them, all of them, all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.900]   in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.860]   I want you to look for a moment at the scene.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.420]   Jerusalem was filled with visitors.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.060]   It was the feast of Pentecost.
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:00.860]   God fearing Jews from all over the known world gathering to give thanks for the first of
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:08.820]   the harvest and to celebrate the giving of the law to Moses on Mount Sinai.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:19.460]   And it is here, not in a secret stable or a lonely mountaintop, but in the middle of
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.300]   a city bursting with people.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.700]   Does that sound familiar?
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:35.900]   We might translate this in Cantonese as Mongkok.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:44.420]   People who have come to seek Him, it is there that God shows up.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:51.940]   God creator of the universe who has existed from beginning, the beginning of time is physically
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.140]   present by His Holy Spirit.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.140]   Let's look at what we see.
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.780]   Wind, wind from heaven fills the whole house.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.740]   Wind just like Elijah felt in the cave.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:14.220]   Fire, like Moses saw at the bush that didn't burn up, like the fire that consumed Elijah's
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.700]   soaking sacrifice.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:28.220]   And God speaks, not through a prophet or a priest or a pastor, but through 120 uneducated,
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:38.580]   uncultured Galileans so that everyone can hear and understand in their own language.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.080]   It's the story of the tower of Babel in reverse.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.500]   You know the story of Babel, the curse of Babel, how humanity, originally speaking just
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:54.740]   one language, was punished for their ambition to build a tower reaching heaven.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.380]   The curse was broken.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:05.600]   When the visitors eventually go home, they will return changed, taking with them the
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:12.640]   experience of the Spirit, the Spirit living in them, the law written in their hearts,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.740]   the first fruits of new life in Christ.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:27.020]   The first thing we notice is this, they all received the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.980]   I'm going to give you a free English lesson this morning.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.460]   Alright, ready?
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:39.780]   The word "all" means all.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.140]   Everybody!
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.460]   You know, you come to church, "I'm sure that person next to me would receive the Holy Spirit."
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.300]   No, they all received the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:12:00.260]   And they all, that's that word again, they all received the gift of tongues.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:06.260]   Now I want to explain this a little bit, put simply, the gift of tongues is a gift given
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:14.540]   to believers by the Holy Spirit where a person speaks in a language that they haven't learned.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:20.420]   This can either happen in a known language which was happened on the day of Pentecost,
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:29.440]   or most commonly an angelic language allowing us to speak to God without going through the
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.460]   operation of the human mind.
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:40.860]   And the good news this morning, so can we.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.860]   So can we.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:47.340]   I'm going to give you the key, I'm going to give you the key right now.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:53.180]   The key is asking.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:59.820]   Matthew 7, 7, "Ask and you might receive."
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:06.700]   Ask, and the people who have been coming to church for two years might receive.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.380]   Ask and you will receive.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:17.980]   Just read on and see what happened after all of them, all of them received the Spirit and
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.220]   all of them were speaking in tongues.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:28.580]   Verse 5, "Now they were staying in Jerusalem, God fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.860]   When they heard this sound, the crowd came together and bewildered, because each one
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.940]   heard their own language being spoken.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:45.980]   Utterly amazed, they asked, "Aren't all of these who are speaking Galileans?"
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:52.180]   Now how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:59.260]   When the crowd hears the disciples miraculously speaking in their own language, they ask,
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.820]   "What does this mean?"
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.500]   I'll tell you what it means.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.300]   It is a profound work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:15.940]   As I said earlier, it is a reverse of the curse of Babel.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:22.500]   I'd like to think of it actually also as a gift of ears, because we read that each one
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:29.460]   of them heard them in their native language.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:40.800]   My friends, as we lean into our uncharted season, we must understand this profound work
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.740]   of the Spirit.
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.860]   God is faithful to his promise.
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:53.260]   Jesus has ascended and sent us the Holy Spirit, bringing us new possibilities as God's power
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.180]   works through community.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:03.860]   The miracle of Pentecost demonstrates the universal reach of the Gospel, crossing barriers
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.340]   of culture, language, and background from day one.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.340]   Look at this.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:20.300]   Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:28.140]   and Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya near Cyrene, visitors from
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:37.980]   Rome, both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans and Arabs, we hear them declaring the wonders
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:43.220]   of God in our own tongues.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:54.500]   These verses highlight the diversity of the crowd and the miraculous nature of this event.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.980]   I wish I could have been there.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.580]   It must have been something really special.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:04.100]   As we read this reaction from the crowd, amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, "What
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.900]   does this mean?"
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.820]   Some however made fun of them.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.820]   They had too much wine.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:19.260]   The mockery reveals a division in the crowd.
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:28.180]   Some were amazed and perplexed, while others chose to dismiss the event as mere drunkenness,
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:34.060]   demonstrating a lack of understanding or willingness to accept the supernatural.
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.420]   My friends, we still see this in the church today.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:49.620]   A genuine move of God can be greeted with excitement and joy or of cynical scepticism.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:55.180]   I have on numerous occasions witnessed both.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:02.900]   But hear me when I say, the outpouring, the receiving of the Holy Spirit must not only
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:08.380]   make a difference to the church and individual Christians.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.220]   And here is the foundational truth.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:17.140]   There is no church without the Spirit.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.980]   We might as well go home.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.540]   There is no church without the Spirit.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:32.940]   No community of faith without the power and the unity and the love He brings.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.260]   I think this is important enough, I want to say it again.
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:43.980]   There is no church without the Spirit and no community of faith without the power, unity
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.140]   and love that He brings.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:55.020]   The Spirit doesn't just enhance existing community.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:01.900]   He births us into a community through our new birth in Christ.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:12.700]   His work is both unifying and diversifying, breaking down barriers while bringing unique
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:20.780]   purposes for us as a diverse body.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.220]   Vine year long.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:35.420]   We are called to be a Spirit empowered community that draws new people into God's family and
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:43.220]   crosses barriers to share the good news.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:50.060]   Drawing new people into the community and crossing barriers to share the good news.
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:55.740]   And the first difference we see happening to the disciples on receiving the Holy Spirit
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.300]   is boldness.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.300]   I love this.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.620]   Peter puts his hand up.
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.620]   Peter!
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.940]   Peter the denier.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:15.780]   Denied Jesus three times becomes Peter the evangelist.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:22.540]   Remember Jews from all over the known world are in Jerusalem for the feast of Pentecost.
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:27.020]   Peter takes his opportunity and begins to preach.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.140]   I love his first statement, it raises more than a smile.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.380]   Then Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:40.140]   Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.700]   Listen carefully to what I say.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.180]   These people are not drunk as you suppose.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.380]   It's only nine in the morning.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.900]   I love the way the message version puts this.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.700]   These people aren't drunk as some of you suspect.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.740]   They haven't had time to get drunk.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.900]   It's only nine in the morning.
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:05.580]   Now I've got to say it was a regular practice for the Jews not to eat or drink anything
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.060]   until the third hour of the day which is nine o'clock.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.020]   They started counting at six o'clock.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:15.020]   Usually on the Sabbath or in festival occasions.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:20.340]   Peter stands with the eleven apostles and addresses the crowd clarifying they are not
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.980]   drunk.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:31.740]   He explains that the events unfolding are a fulfillment of a prophecy that was given
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.540]   in Joel 2 28 to 32.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.220]   You'll be familiar with this.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:44.980]   It says in the last days I will pour out my spirit on who?
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.220]   All people.
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.060]   Your sons and daughters will prophesy.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.140]   Your young men will see visions.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.540]   Your old men will dream dreams.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.860]   I dream a lot these days.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:03.220]   Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my spirit in those days and
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.040]   they will prophesy.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:13.980]   You see in the Old Testament the Holy Spirit had been given to certain people at certain
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:18.020]   times for certain tasks.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:25.540]   But Joel's prophecy said that a time would come that the Holy Spirit would be poured
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:30.500]   out on all people at all times.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:39.340]   Imagine Ho Sun Yee building on Sunday 28th of August at 1230pm.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.120]   Let's take a look.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.200]   In the last days God said I will pour out my spirit on all people.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.440]   The emphasis is on all.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.880]   Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.720]   It is regardless of sex.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.280]   Your young men will see visions.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.640]   Your old men will dream dreams.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.520]   It's regardless of age.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.960]   Even on my servants.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.920]   Regardless of background, race, colour, rank.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.600]   Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my spirit in those days.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.800]   It is for everyone.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.840]   And they will prophesy.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:28.560]   In these verses it signifies that people including men and women, young and old, will speak under
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.160]   divine inspiration.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:37.840]   This ability to prophesy is seen as a sign of God's spirit being poured out on all flesh.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:47.760]   Now prophecy is not foretelling like a fortune teller or a soothsayer, but foretelling.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.040]   Declaring God's word.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:57.760]   I believe that we at Vine Yuen Long are called to have a prophetic voice to our neighbours
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.800]   and our community.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.560]   What does this mean for us?
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:13.440]   We are called to be a spirit empowered community that draws people into God's family and crosses
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:20.500]   all barriers, race, age, sex, social standing, to share the good news.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:26.000]   The same spirit that fell at Pentecost is at work among us today.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.080]   Ready to form us into the community that God intends in this season.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:46.520]   But I want to ask the question, what barriers is God calling us to cross?
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:54.000]   How can we ready our hearts to welcome those with different backgrounds?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.480]   Peter then reminds us, directly quoting from Joel 2, 30-31, of Christ's promise to come
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.480]   again.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.480]   We talked about it earlier, Ben, again.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:15.240]   In glory for his people and for the judgment that awaits those who reject him.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.840]   The verses on the screen describe cosmic events.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.940]   Stars in the sky, signs on the earth, blood, fire and smoke preceding the great and glorious
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.560]   day of the Lord.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:34.360]   These verses are interpreted as signs of God's judgment and the coming of God's Christ's
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.840]   kingdom.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:42.840]   With the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost being a partial fulfilment of Joel's
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.440]   prophecy.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:54.560]   You see, throughout his sermon, where he quotes the prophet Joel, Peter hammers away, hammers
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.960]   away, hammers away at a single point.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:09.400]   Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour and people must put their faith in him.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:15.600]   Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour and people must put their faith in him.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:22.480]   He emphasises that salvation is available to all.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:28.080]   All who believe and all who call upon the name of the Lord.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:36.920]   That means anyone, regardless of background or past actions, can be saved by putting their
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:43.720]   faith and their trust in Jesus Christ.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.680]   I'll put a verse up there.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.120]   Next verse.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.120]   Let's read it all together.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120]   Ready?
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.640]   One, two, three.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.020]   And everyone calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.020]   That was three of you.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.020]   Let's do it again.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.280]   One, two, three.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:07.240]   And everyone calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.360]   One more free English lesson.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.640]   Everyone means everyone.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   Close your eyes, please.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.320]   Let's have every eye closed now.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:25.360]   The band can come back.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.360]   Just take a moment.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.760]   Let's have every eye closed, please.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.640]   Let's respect this moment.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:38.440]   I want to give an opportunity here and now, right here and now, for this verse to become
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.320]   a reality for someone.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:51.400]   If there is anybody here at this moment who is not following Christ, you wouldn't call
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.080]   yourself a Christian.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.320]   There's good news today.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.440]   And the good news is in this verse.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:10.120]   Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:19.040]   And just while every eye is closed, if you would like to call upon the name of the Lord
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.400]   for the first time today, maybe a friend brought you to church, maybe you don't even know why
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.160]   you're here.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.360]   Maybe you've been coming for weeks and weeks and weeks, but haven't really made that connection
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.200]   with Jesus Christ.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.600]   You wouldn't call yourself a Christian.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:42.960]   The good news is all that can change this morning.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.560]   If you would like to give your life to Jesus Christ, I would just like you, while every
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:57.400]   eye is closed, to put up your hands so I can pray for you.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.600]   I'm not going to embarrass anyone here this morning, but if you would like to become a
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:09.640]   Christian this morning, if you would like to give your life to Jesus Christ, this is
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.400]   your moment.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.320]   So just while every eye is closed, if that's you, I'd love to pray for you.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.040]   Would you put up your hands so I can see you?
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.680]   I'm going to pray for you.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.600]   We'll just wait for a moment.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   Thank you, Lord.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.520]   Thank you, Lord.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:38.520]   Let's stand, everybody.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:46.000]   When the day of Pentecost came, all the disciples were in one place.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.320]   One place physically, one place spiritually.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.160]   The Holy Spirit came upon them.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.040]   They were filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:03.220]   They prayed in tongues.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.680]   The Church of Christ was born.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.520]   Spirit lit the flame.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.760]   I want you, if you're just comfortable, just put your hands in front of you like this to
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.760]   receive.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:24.040]   We're going to ask the Holy Spirit now just to come and to fill us as individuals, as
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.640]   a church.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.920]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.640]   Fill us with your power.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.720]   Fill us with the boldness that Peter had.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:45.800]   Fill us with the love for the people that the disciples had.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:52.200]   Fill us, Lord, that you might change this community and the communities that we serve.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.000]   Holy Spirit, we wait for you.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.280]   Will you come?
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.880]   You may be just feeling God's peace upon you.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:14.480]   You may be feeling strangely warm.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.640]   Maybe your hands are tingling.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.000]   You don't have to receive any of these things, but Lord is doing something in this room right
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   now.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.680]   Just receive the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.160]   You say, "But Pastor, I was filled with the Holy Spirit five years ago."
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.760]   I'm not interested.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.200]   Let's be filled with the Holy Spirit today and tomorrow and the day after and the day
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   after.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.840]   Let's go on being filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.920]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:53.360]   Touch us and fill us.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.440]   On the day of Pentecost, the disciples all started to pray in a language they didn't
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.440]   understand.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.120]   We call it the gift of tongues.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:06.880]   If you want to receive that gift, just open your mouth and start to speak.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.680]   Don't say A, B, C or a word.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.800]   Don't speak in a language you know.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.320]   Just open your mouth and allow God to work through you.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.480]   Let's just spend a moment.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.440]   If you want to do that, just start today.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:26.440]   Come on, just be bold.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:48.600]   You can afford to speak a little bit louder.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:54.000]   It's amazing.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.240]   I can see happening all around this auditorium.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.280]   God touching people, people praying in the language of the Spirit.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.440]   I just want to encourage you.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:10.200]   We're just going to take a couple more minutes just to do this.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:35.320]   I just want you to stop.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.440]   It shows that this is something which you are in control of.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.680]   It's not like an evil spirit that controls you and gets you to pray in a strange tongue.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.040]   You can start or stop when you want to.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.880]   For those of you who are a little bit doubtful, I just recommend you go home and get under
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   the shower.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.040]   Let the shower run and start to pray in tongues.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   It's good.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.320]   It makes you so unconscious of yourself.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:03.320]   Okay, let's just start to pray out again.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:19.520]   All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:31.480]   All of them prayed in tongues.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:36.640]   The news I've got for you this morning is, oh yes, it was for you.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.080]   Being filled with the Holy Spirit was a blessing for you.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.160]   Receiving the gift of tongues was for you.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.880]   God hasn't got us here this morning for that.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.800]   He's got us this morning for them out there.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.280]   Building bridges with our community.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.640]   I'm going to pray right now.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:03.400]   The Lord that what you have done in this place this morning, what you're doing in our lives
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:08.520]   now, what are you going to continue to do Lord when we go home and put the shower on
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.840]   and pray in tongues?
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:16.200]   Lord, it's not about a church service.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.280]   It's about a community.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:28.880]   Lord would you send us out in the power of your Holy Spirit to build bridges with our
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:35.360]   family, the people we work with, the people we're going to meet on the MTR on the way
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:40.880]   home.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.960]   There is a world out there that needs to hear the good news of Jesus.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.800]   And the good news is this, that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:57.720]   In a few weeks time we'll be celebrating that when we do the baptism.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.960]   People who have given their lives to Jesus, celebrating that.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:14.120]   Lord send us from this place down the stairs, out into the square, into the Yoho Mall and
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:28.540]   the MTR, that Hong Kong would be saved, that China would be saved, that you would allow
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:36.340]   us to take this Gospel, this precious Gospel to the ends of the earth.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.000]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.120]   Amen.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   Let's worship God together.
