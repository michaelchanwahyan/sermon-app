[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   One of the things that we're doing here in the month of June and July at the Vine is
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.680]   Branches of Hope Awareness Month.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.160]   If you've been coming to the Vine for a while, you'll know that Branches of Hope is the NGO
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.040]   that the Vine supports as part of the wider ministry of our church, where we're working
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.560]   with two groups of vulnerable people in our city, asylum seekers and refugees, and those
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.040]   that are caught up in forced labor or human trafficking in our city.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.080]   And so we serve those two areas through the work of Branches of Hope.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.560]   And Branches of Hope Awareness Month is a month that starts on World Refugee Day, that
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.880]   starts on June 20th, just last week, and goes all the way to July 30th, where we have World
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.760]   Day Against the Trafficking of Persons.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.440]   And in between that time, we celebrate the work that we do in this NGO.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.000]   And there's a bunch of things that are happening over the month, both internally here at the
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.400]   Vine, also externally out in the city.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.000]   Find out more about that, you can just go to branchesofhope.org.hk/Boham, branchesofhope.org.hk/Boham.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.560]   Branches of Hope Awareness Month 2022, and that'll be a way to find out a little bit
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.560]   more.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.960]   There's two events that are coming up that I wanted to highlight today.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.920]   The first is we're gonna have Branches of Hope Sunday next week.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.240]   So next week, our whole service is gonna be focused on the work that we do with asylum
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.200]   seekers and refugees, as well as those caught up in trafficking in Hong Kong.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.640]   And we're gonna be telling you a lot more about that work.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.480]   What we're calling it is our voices and our stories.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.200]   And what we're gonna be doing is letting you hear the voices of the various clients that
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.360]   we serve in those two areas.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.840]   And so you're gonna hear their personal stories, you're gonna hear what it's like for them
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.880]   to be in Hong Kong at this time, the challenges that they face.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.320]   And that's gonna be a great way for you to be a little bit more informed about some of
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.360]   the vulnerable groups that we serve and how you also can be involved in helping the work
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.440]   of Branches of Hope here in Hong Kong.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.840]   So that will be next Sunday.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.360]   And then starting on July 9th, there's an incredible restaurant in Hong Kong called
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.640]   Orca.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.580]   It's run by two people from the Vine Church.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.880]   It's on Wyndham Street.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.920]   If you've never been there for food, I can highly recommend it.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.920]   They're not paying me to say this.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.680]   But they're gonna be hosting a photography exhibition that's based on the idea of our
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.280]   voices and our stories, a photography exhibition that tells the story of some of the clients
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.240]   that Branches of Hope serve.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.380]   So from July 9th onwards, you can go to Orca Restaurant on Wyndham Street.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.980]   You can have a fantastic meal with you and your family.
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.360]   And then the proceeds from some of the meals will be given to Branches of Hope, as well
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   as the photography exhibition will be there in the restaurant.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.480]   So you can check that out.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.760]   And it's a great way of telling friends and family a little bit about that work for vulnerable
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.400]   people, which can also lead into a great conversation about Jesus.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.240]   So check out the restaurant.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.760]   Check out that photography exhibition.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.880]   I think that'll be a blessing to you.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.560]   Well, this week ahead for Hong Kong is one of the most important weeks in Hong Kong's
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.560]   history.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.160]   July 1st is this Friday.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.960]   It's not just a day off.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.240]   It's a significant day for leadership transition in our city.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.400]   That's not every July 1st, but this year, because we've had a transition in our chief
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.920]   executive, that transition takes place on July 1st.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.800]   Carrie Lam will be handing over as chief executive, and John Lee will be becoming our new chief
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.600]   executive, and his cabinet is all being sworn in on that day.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.040]   We also heard this week that Xi Jinping is going to be visiting Hong Kong on July 1st.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.080]   He's going to be a part of that transition process.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.960]   Whether there's change or transition of any leadership in any city or any country, that
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.080]   requires a prayer.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.520]   It requires a sense of understanding what's happening in our city.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.600]   And the Scriptures are very clear that we are to pray for those who are in governing
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.520]   authority over us.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.720]   We know in Scripture that our ultimate authority is God and God alone.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.800]   Paul in Ephesians says, "His is the name that is above every name," another way of translating
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   that.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.200]   "His is the title above every other title."
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.920]   In other words, every authority sits under Jesus Christ.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.960]   At the same time, the Bible encourages us to pray for the human authorities that govern
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.000]   us so that our lives will go well, so that they'll be flourishing in the land, and that
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.200]   is something that we think is important to do here at the Vine.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.880]   And so with this week ahead of us, with July 1st right there, we wanted to take some time
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.680]   in this service to really pray and pray for that leadership transition in our cities.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.680]   Does that sound good?
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.680]   So, can I invite you all to stand?
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.960]   Again, I know it's a little bit like yoga today, up and down, up and down, up and down.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.560]   But we want to stand before the Lord as we pray for Hong Kong and as we pray for this
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   leadership transition.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.600]   And I just want to say, no matter how you might feel about the leadership in this city,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.160]   no matter how you might feel about that transition, we need to pray and pray that the Spirit of
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.800]   God would bless our city.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.520]   So let's pray.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.000]   Father, we just come before you today with Hong Kong as we come into this important week
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.280]   of our city's history.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.320]   Father, the first thing we want to do is pray for Carrie Lam.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.480]   Lord, we want to pray as she transitions out from being chief executive and back into normal
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.720]   private life.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.520]   And Lord, we know that she has stressed in the last couple of weeks that her desire is
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.600]   to rest and spend time with her family.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.520]   So Lord, we want to pray for that transition for her.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.880]   We can't understand what it is that she must be going through as she thinks about handing
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.420]   over the reins of leadership in this city and spending more time with her family.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.200]   But we do want to pray that you would give her rest.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.080]   We do want to pray that you would restore and strengthen her relationships with her
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.880]   loved ones and Lord, that that would be a time of flourishing for her.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.200]   Lord, we pray for John Lee as he steps in to take on leadership here in Hong Kong.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.200]   Lord, we ask that you would give him great wisdom and strength for the work that you're
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.680]   going to require of him.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.840]   Lord, we pray that he would have justice on his heart.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.860]   Lord, we pray that you would bless him with your spirit to lead to the best of his ability,
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.860]   Lord.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.620]   Lord, we pray for the cabinet that's being sworn in around him.
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.640]   We thank you for the men and women that he has raised up and Lord, we pray that you would
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.980]   also place your hand upon them and guide them.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.580]   Lord, we pray for the churches of this city, knowing that you have called us to be your
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.540]   hands and feet in this time.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.120]   Lord, we ask that you would cause the church to be in prayer for its city in this time.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.920]   Lord, we know that the ultimate hope of any city, of any nation is the local church.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.180]   And so Lord, we want to pray for the infusing of your spirit and your power upon your local
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.980]   church to be your hands and feet in this time, in this hour.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.380]   That we would be on our knees praying for those that lead us, that we'd be on our knees
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.360]   praying for justice, that we'd be on our knees praying for the gospel to have its greatest
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.820]   fruit in our city like never before.
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.720]   As we just prayed earlier, we pray that the church in this city is not defeated and Lord,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:51.240]   we pray that you would release us as a prayer people dedicated for blessing our city so
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.280]   that all that live in it, and we say all that live in it, would flourish.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.280]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name, everyone says.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.280]   Amen.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.280]   Thank you so much.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   You can have a seat again.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.280]   No, actually stand up again.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   No, just kidding.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.280]   Don't stand up again.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.280]   No, no, you can have a seat.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.280]   Sorry, I'm gonna make you up and down.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   I just like doing that.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.880]   We're gonna move into a time of offering today and as we do our offering, it's just a way
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.440]   of us giving our worship to Christ and making sure that what he's given us, we're able to
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.440]   give freely.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.280]   And you're gonna be hearing a little bit more about that in our message today.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.480]   But we always do offering right now digitally as well as touchless as we're calling it in
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.520]   this time of COVID-19.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.480]   On your chair, there's an envelope.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.080]   If you wanna give digitally, you just scan the QR codes.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.640]   If you wanna give through a cash, credit card, or check, you could do that by filling in
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.640]   the envelope that's on your chair.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.400]   And then after the service, either on the fourth floor or here on the second floor,
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.400]   just walk out.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.640]   There's a little kind of see-through sort of plastic box.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.200]   You can put your envelope in there and that's a way for you to be able to do your offering.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.960]   Let me pray for us as we come in to do that today.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.800]   Father, we thank you for the gift that it is to share in giving.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.640]   Lord, we thank you that you called us to be stewards of the resources that you've given
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.640]   to us.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.960]   Lord, as we steward those resources well, Lord, we pray that we would do so without
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.960]   strings attached.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.280]   Our hands would be open before you.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.840]   That Lord, we would give to you, Lord, knowing and trusting that you know exactly what it
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.560]   is that the vine needs.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.960]   And Lord, we know that exactly what is given is what you want to bless this church with.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.240]   Lord, I pray that you would help us as the vine to be open-handed towards the needs that
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.040]   are within our community.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.440]   You would help us also to be open-handed towards the missions and ministry organizations that
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.880]   we support as a church.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.760]   Lord, that we would do this because it is part of that stewardship.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.240]   And Lord, we recognize that as we give, we can never out-give you.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.400]   And Lord, I want to pray for your resources to flow over every person in this room as
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.600]   they are open-handed as stewards of all the things that you've given them.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.080]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name, everyone says, amen.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.760]   Well, we're continuing our series, The Unfinished Story, together today.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.400]   We've got a couple of more weeks left in the book of Acts as we've been studying and looking
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.120]   at discipleship and evangelism in the book of Acts.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.000]   And today, we're looking at a really important passage where Paul comes and does a farewell
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.120]   with the elders of Ephesus.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.480]   And it's such a beautiful, profound, and very personal story.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.760]   And I couldn't think of anyone better to share that story with us than one of our elders,
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   Sidney Yip.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.760]   Can you put your hands together as Sidney comes?
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.840]   And I'm going to pray for Sidney.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:33.320]   Father, just thank you so much for this man who, as chairman of our eldership, takes on
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.360]   a real mantle of responsibility and leadership here at the Vine, but does so with great humility
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   and love.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.040]   Lord, as he preaches out of what's a very personal story for Paul, and also a very personal
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.160]   story for Sidney, I pray that you would open our own hearts to what it is that you want
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.160]   to say to us.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.880]   Would you challenge us, Lord, and change us?
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.240]   And we thank you for this.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   In Jesus' name, everyone says, "Amen."
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:08.040]   Hey, thank you, Andrew.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.480]   Sorry.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:18.840]   It was 25 years ago, in the year of 1997, that we bid farewell to this land, supposedly
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.240]   for good, and we emigrated to Singapore.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.960]   While we were residing there, my parents made a difficult trip to come down and visit us
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.560]   and to spend time with us.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.440]   I had a heart-to-heart talk with him.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:42.840]   The honest question we had to ask is whether he would spend his last days with us, his
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:49.440]   next generation, in a foreign land, or he might choose to come back to Hong Kong, his
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.760]   hometown.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.120]   But that would also mean that it would be the last time that we embrace him in this
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.120]   land of the living.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:06.920]   We made the decision to fly back to Hong Kong with my mom while he could still travel, with
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   full knowledge that that is very likely his last time.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.320]   While God was gracious, we actually had a few other occasions whereby we traveled and
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.960]   visited him.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.760]   In fact, the whole family, three siblings, we came back from three different countries
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:32.000]   with our next generation to witness his water baptism in the hospital ground.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.280]   In a few weeks down the road, he was able to witness my mom's water baptism.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.320]   And that very night, he passed on peacefully.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.360]   What a farewell.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:54.280]   And today we are going to refer to the farewell from Paul to the elders of Ephesus upon his
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.560]   rounding up his third missionary journey, on route to Jerusalem.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:07.760]   So surely Paul has much to say to his church and to us, and we have much to learn.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:15.280]   So Paul will set an example for us to live for Christ and to endure sufferings.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:22.200]   He will encourage the elders, and indeed all of us, to shepherd over the flock.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:29.680]   And last, none the least, that how we may give to be a blessing.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:35.400]   Throughout this message, I will try to put together that binding to the Holy Spirit,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:43.160]   that love by serving and watching over others, and giving are all integrated.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:49.480]   But I think it would be helpful that we do a quick recap of the ministry of Paul in Ephesus.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:57.120]   After all, he spent two years in this mission station, much longer than any others, including
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.280]   Corinth.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:07.480]   He ministered in Ephesus, and he performed extraordinary miracles of healing, of ministry,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.920]   of the Word.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.800]   And in fact, there is this comic story.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:18.560]   A family of seven sons of a Jewish priest, they imitated Paul and invoked the name of
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.200]   Jesus Christ to practice exorcism.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:30.680]   But of course, the demon won't listen to them, and in fact, those sons were badly beaten
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.000]   up by the demons.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.680]   But that gave an awe and fear that gripped the people of Ephesus.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.320]   They have such reference for the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   It was recorded in Acts 19, "When this became known to the Jews and great living Ephesus,
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:58.600]   they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high esteem."
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.660]   In this way, the Word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:10.840]   The city of Ephesus and its culture was literally transformed by Paul's ministry.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:17.120]   And most of all, the Word of God spread throughout Asia Minor, which was the key commercial route
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.080]   linking the eastern and the western part of the Roman Empire.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:28.120]   Well, we almost yearned for the same kind of impactful ministry here in Hong Kong to
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.000]   be replicated.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.800]   After the famous riots in Ephesus, God set His heart to preach all the way to Rome, and
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:44.160]   by now, He would travel out to Macedonia and Greece to collect love offerings for the Judean
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.160]   church.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:53.440]   While He was departing Greece, the Jews made up a plot so Paul has to make a deroute.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:59.200]   He has to pass by Ephesus, and therefore, he could only call upon the elders to say
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.280]   a final farewell.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:08.280]   Church, let's appreciate the power in this old Paul.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.880]   And the power really comes from the very personal and intimate relationship between Paul and
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   his beloved church.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:24.600]   Acts 20, "When they arrived, he said to them, 'You know how I lived the whole time I was
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.140]   with you.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:33.680]   On the first day I came to the province of Asia, I served with great humility and with
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:41.000]   tears in the midst of severe testing by the flaws of my Jewish opponents.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   You know I have not hesitated to preach anything that will be helpful to you.'"
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.560]   Paul has three main themes to cover.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:55.200]   He's presenting himself as an example for the Ephesian elders.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.560]   He presents to them a charge and a warning.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.760]   And finally, how he commits them to God.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:07.720]   Obviously, the most prominent theme of Paul would be his own example.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   He was an example as he identified with the people.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.960]   He lived amongst them.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.120]   He served God with humility and tears, and he went from house to house to preach.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:25.040]   Indeed, he served the God with great humility and with tears.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.880]   And it is here that we have a glimpse into the very tender side of Paul.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.720]   While we must know that humility is not a virtue readily embraced by the Roman culture,
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:44.760]   rather it was often thought to be a representation, a sign of weakness for the individual.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:52.680]   Yet Paul seeks to embody a servant leader model that he learns from the Lord Jesus.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   While in my previous church in Singapore, the parking lot is about seven minutes from
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.400]   the church premise.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:05.920]   And in order to pamper the congregants, show that they do not have to walk under the hot
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.880]   sun, we actually arranged for a pickup van for them.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.440]   While the interesting thing is the drive itself takes five minutes.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:21.960]   Anyway, I volunteer to be one of the driver, and it is through such serving that you know
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:27.920]   sometimes there are many things that was done in this church, in that church, that was not
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   appreciated.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:36.480]   Anyway, we, the volunteers do double up as traffic marshals, and as we directed the traffic
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:43.320]   in a double-parked, fully-packed car park, we received scolding, left and right, from
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.360]   none other than the congregants.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:56.640]   But that's where we learn humility, while we served in low positions.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.760]   Paul sets yet another example.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.600]   He obeyed, he obeyed despite his sufferings.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:09.720]   While there seems to be two conflicting work of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit compelled
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.480]   Paul to travel to Jerusalem.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:19.320]   Yet at the same time, he gave much warnings about his possible sufferings.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:26.440]   But Paul's commitment to Christ helps him reconcile the seeming contradiction.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:34.800]   Even if such faithfulness involves suffering and imprisonment, he's willing to obey.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.600]   Compelled by the Spirit, I'm going to Jerusalem.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:47.160]   Paul uses the image of being chained, tied up like a prisoner, in this instance, by the
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.480]   Holy Spirit.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.240]   This same word, compelled, is also translated as bound.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:59.760]   It's used to describe Paul's binding in chains when he subsequently was indeed taken into
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.600]   custody by the Romans in Jerusalem.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:14.400]   The metaphor underlines Paul's conviction that indeed this is a divine imperative, bound
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.280]   by the Spirit.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.760]   Yet we also record how Paul reflected on his ministry.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:28.680]   Despite his being bind in chains, he was actually able to advise the gospel all the way to the
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.000]   royal court in Rome.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.240]   And this gospel continues to spread despite his imprisonment.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.640]   As for Paul, in every city, the Holy Spirit warns him.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:51.040]   Even after his farewell in Ephesus, along the way to Jerusalem, people in Tyre warned
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.760]   of the same fate awaiting him.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:05.920]   The Judean prophet Agabus also warned Paul that he will be bound and arrested as he travels
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.440]   to Jerusalem.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.600]   But he considered his life worth nothing.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.000]   His only aim is to finish the race and complete the task that Lord Jesus Christ has given
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.040]   him, the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.000]   Paul remained bound to Christ.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.600]   What does binding mean for us?
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:37.040]   So some years back, I signed up for a venture skydiving in New Zealand.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:45.320]   After a really sleepless night, I checked into the venue, and by the time we were bound,
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:53.480]   strapped in tandem to the instructor, and the plane began to ascend, there's no chance
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.040]   to check him out.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:01.760]   But indeed, throughout the ascent, I frantically checked that I'm really tightly bound to my
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.400]   instructor.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:11.200]   But then there's some whisper between the instructors, "Oh, we made a mistake."
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.200]   "Wow, what mistake?"
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:21.360]   "Well, we find out that we signed up for 12,000 feet jump off.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.760]   But they mixed it up.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.680]   Now we are to jump off 15,000 feet."
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.960]   "Well, it's a bonus.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.520]   It's a free upgrade."
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:36.640]   "Well, the thing is, while it may not have too much difference, well, the real difference
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.000]   is the time of the free fall.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.480]   You free fall longer before the parachute opens up around 3,000 feet.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   But there would not be any difference as long as the parachute opens up and you are tightly
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.480]   bound."
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:22:03.040]   Well, this is a leap of faith, and I'm eternally grateful that I was indeed tightly bound really
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   well.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:13.000]   Well, the thing is, are we tightly bound to Christ?
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.960]   Sometimes in our different seasons in life, we almost felt that we were free fall.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.460]   We just dropped.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.920]   We just fall.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.360]   But there we are.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.520]   Are we bound tightly to Jesus?
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.640]   Do you take courage from your relationship with Him that in these challenging times,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.840]   you can fully entrust in Him?
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:45.040]   Sometimes fear comes into our lives, especially when we fail to be bound tightly to Christ.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:51.520]   But if any one of us is feeling that sense of fear, check to see how your relationship
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.520]   with Jesus is.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.600]   He will catch you always, even as you fall, but stay bound to Him.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.800]   Paul exclaims, "What then is my reward?
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.960]   Just this, that in preaching the gospel, I may offer it free.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:16.920]   I do this, all of this, for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings."
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:24.200]   In other words, Paul is telling us the cause of the gospel is so great that any price is
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.920]   worth paying in order to advance it.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.000]   Are we willing to pay that price?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.440]   Indeed, Paul issued a warning and a charge for his elders.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:44.460]   He's fully aware that after his departure, things could go very wrong in Ephesus Church.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.680]   So most importantly, the elders are to watch out for themselves.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:55.200]   And of course, they must also watch over and shepherd the flock.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.620]   The concept of a flock of sheep as an image of the community of God's people is well-rooted
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.040]   in the Old Testament.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:10.980]   In the book of Ezekiel, the shepherds have been so concerned about feeding themselves
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.520]   that their sheep went astray.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.040]   They were not well-fed.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:22.760]   They have roamed the hillsides to unprotected areas and have become prey for the wild animals.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:30.440]   And that's where, in this very dreadful situation, God himself took up to become the shepherd
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.240]   for his sheep.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:39.140]   That beautiful role of being the shepherd, the pastor of his people is beautifully expressed
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.200]   in Psalm 23.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.320]   Now fast forward to New Testament.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.400]   Of course, we know that Jesus becomes our good shepherd.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:57.920]   Then Peter, as a representative of all Christian leaders, is three times entrusted by Jesus,
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.240]   "Take care of my sheep.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.760]   Take care of my sheep.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.080]   Take care of my sheep."
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:11.400]   And now here, Paul reminded the leaders must shepherd the flock.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.840]   So Paul himself is working as a tent maker in Ephesus.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:20.760]   Well, this allowed him to live amongst the people in the city where many just travel
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.120]   in and travel out.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:29.720]   Literally, he come across people from all walks of life from throughout the Roman Empire.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:37.320]   And often people come to him or his shop to receive his service and ministry.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:43.120]   In his workplace, he probably reached out to more people than he managed in the synagogue
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.680]   and the hall where he preached.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.200]   Paul set out the example of living amongst people.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.540]   We may say that, well, he's a double agent.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:26:00.800]   He works to support himself in the ministry during the day and he pastor whenever in between.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.600]   But for us, we can all likewise follow his example.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.560]   Yes, we do have a daytime job, but we can be the double agents.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.600]   Indeed, we should embrace our shepherd role.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:20.200]   God has entrusted someone under our care, someone for us to look out for.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:27.400]   Well, of course, the challenge for modern day believers is real, very real.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:33.480]   We are so used to forfeiting our pastoral roles to the pastors.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:40.800]   True, not all of us are pastors or elders or leaders by title, but we are all endowed
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:45.480]   with that responsibility, that noble task to look out for others.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:52.680]   The very one sitting just right next to you, that very role of a shepherd to look out to
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.120]   pastor his flock.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:02.120]   Now your flock could be your staff while you're a boss, while you're a middle management,
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.200]   a team leader, a teacher, a manager.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.340]   Your flock could be your household.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.680]   Come on, husbands, look after your household.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.000]   Shepherd your flock, your spouse, your children.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.920]   Your flock could also be your small group members, your ministry co-leaders.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:30.160]   Wherever God places us, we are duty bound to watch out for each other.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:37.320]   I'm tremendously blessed as the nature of my work allow me to reach out to people from
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.000]   all different countries who come and visit me.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.040]   Not long ago, I had that privilege to pray for a couple who came from a real far away
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.560]   country that I never had a chance to travel to.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.920]   But I'm more blessed than they are, even as they go through some of those toughest moments
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.800]   in life, but I can journey on with them.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:07.880]   I have fond memories of another lady under my care in my clinical practice and her lovely
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.340]   children.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:15.520]   We became good friends as she had a very prolonged stay in the hospital.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:23.160]   Then we, including my wife and the small group, were able to reach out to her, to befriend
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:30.960]   her, to invite her to celebrate her birthday outside of the hospital, and to share Jesus
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.240]   with her.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:41.120]   And we were also privileged to stand alongside her family when we bid her final farewell
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.920]   during her funeral.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.480]   We teared, and yet we are comforted.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:56.160]   On quite a few subsequent Chinese New Years, her children would continue to call us and
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.520]   send us their greetings.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:08.320]   I'm confident that by now they have grown up to become young men, young women of stature,
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.000]   because ultimately it is Christ who watch over them.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.760]   But we have that honor to partner with Christ to watch over them.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:25.800]   While many of you in the audience is aware that I'm serving as an elder in this church,
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.920]   what a noble task and yet awesome responsibility.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.320]   Yet you may wonder what elders really do in this church.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.000]   Well very briefly, we are elected by the congregation for a three-year term.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.480]   We can be re-elected for another term, a total, a max of six years, with occasional exceptions.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.380]   So we're here to help shoulder the spiritual leadership of the church.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:58.480]   We are to discern and advise on critical matters, both spiritual and strategic.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.400]   Example the church plant.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:07.540]   We carry the responsibility of corporate governance, including financial well-being of the church,
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.360]   as well as legal responsibilities in the secular sphere.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:17.840]   But most of all, we also are there to watch out for the congregation.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.120]   Over the past six years, we have witnessed some of the most phenomenal growth of this
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   church.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:29.940]   Then of course, we also see the challenge of the social movements and the seemingly
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.960]   never-ending COVID-19.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:40.560]   But you can be best assured, and you have probably experienced, how the pastoral team
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.760]   has stayed committed to watch out for you.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.560]   Now fellow elders and I are rightfully not in the forefront of ministry, but we share
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:56.800]   that burden of spiritual overseeing to look out for the flock.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:05.160]   Personally, I do often find pause, charge, and warning too much to bear.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:10.600]   How are we able to shepherd the flock when sometimes we don't even know our flock?
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.720]   There was a real challenge when our church grew so fast a few years ago.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   Now we have another challenge when we have so much dynamic movements in and out of the
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.720]   flock.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:28.000]   We hardly recognize your faces behind the masks.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.300]   But I find my comfort and reassurance that it may not be most important that we know
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.100]   you in person or vice versa.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:44.360]   It is only important that you are known by our chief shepherd, Lord Jesus Christ, and
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.880]   that you continue to hear His voice.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:54.800]   But for as long as you are part of this faith community, our commitment remains that we
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.960]   shall watch over you.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:05.520]   Apostle Peter likewise encouraged all of us, "Tend the flock, not as compelled to do, but
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:13.280]   willingly, not for gain, but eagerly be examples."
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:19.520]   Some 14 years ago, we relocated back to Hong Kong, and someone looked out for us here in
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.240]   this church.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:27.440]   Now church, think of yourself as a pastor, a shepherd.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:33.080]   Each and every one of us can look out for someone in our midst, in our own sphere of
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.440]   influence.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.520]   Paul concludes his speech by once more presenting the challenge of his own life as an example
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.040]   for the others to follow.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.640]   While he was with them, he showed sincere commitment.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.960]   He did not convert what others had.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:56.520]   Rather, he worked hard with his own hands to provide for the needs of his team.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:03.200]   And in the process of earning money, he also helped those who are in need.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.680]   We must help the weak.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:12.320]   Diversity with money, with food, with material possessions is indeed a hallmark of the early
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.320]   church.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:19.760]   And it is a virtue that Paul empowers his congregation to practice.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:26.240]   Remembering the words the Lord Jesus Christ said, "It is more blessed to give than to
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:34.280]   receive," we must understand there is this principle of reciprocity, which is deeply
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.360]   ingrained in the Greek culture.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:44.880]   That is, one must give in equal measure to what one has received.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.840]   Paul's exhortation strikes out this idea.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:54.800]   Instead, he encouraged believers to give to those who cannot give in return.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:02.920]   In the book of Acts, in fact, Luke describes how in the church there was no needy person,
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:10.160]   which itself looks back to the law of Moses, which commanded that the confident community,
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.640]   there should be no persons in need.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:21.160]   Herein, Paul encouraged his communities to look out for the poor in their midst.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:28.080]   The church now should think of herself as the vanguard of a renewed Israel community,
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.800]   an ideal community where no one was to be left to cope alone.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:41.240]   And even as he was persecuted by his own people, Paul cared for those in need, including those
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   in Judea, to support them during the famine.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:52.720]   Ultimately, our giving of money, of our life, and of ourselves should be a reflection of
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:59.040]   what we learned from our Lord Jesus Christ as he gave of himself.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.560]   You're familiar with the generosity of our master, Jesus Christ.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.720]   Rich as he was, he gave it all away for us.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:14.240]   In one stroke, he became poor and we became rich.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.680]   So a quick summary of what a Christian expression should be like.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.640]   There should be binding to the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:27.920]   We are to serve, to watch out for others, and we are to give.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:35.120]   As we bind ourselves to Christ, we experience his love to serve others with great love,
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.200]   being generous in the giving of ourselves.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:46.120]   And sometimes when our love bank got depleted, our binding to Christ filled us up once again,
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.560]   so the cycle can continue.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:58.280]   Now while there's much encouragement from Paul, after all, a farewell is a farewell.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   It is in fact heartbreaking to have Paul bring this up again in his farewell speech, that
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:11.160]   they would never see his face again.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:17.040]   Now even in modern days, we face that kind of dilemma when we think of legacy that we
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.520]   may leave behind.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.440]   And we are one day no longer in this land of living.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.760]   On that note, we really need to know two things.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.840]   That all our stuff is not ours.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.680]   And number two, in all our stuff, it's not us.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.760]   We are not defined by what we have.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:47.160]   Life indeed is not defined by what we have, even when we have a lot.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:52.120]   I recall the very first time that I had the privilege to sit down with Pastor Andrew for
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.960]   lunch, that was some six or seven years ago.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:01.760]   I guess he was interviewing me to see whether I'm fit to be considered to become an elder
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.480]   in the vine.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.440]   So I came up with this model answer.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:15.480]   I came to a season of my life that I realized is much more important for me to give than
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.200]   to receive.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:23.920]   Well it is not a matter of whether I had enough materially at that time.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:33.000]   It is just a realization that I'm left with so little chances and time to give of myself.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.640]   In fact my favorite story that I shared with one of my very rich patients was a parable
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:46.320]   of the rich man who built yet another vine to store even more.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:52.960]   While he was to go through a minor surgery under light anesthesia, but he went into a
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.440]   somewhat confused state.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:02.920]   He was so scared, so fearful as if he was running for his life.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:08.440]   So after the incident, it opened up an opportunity whereby I can reach out to him to care for
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:14.320]   him, and to introduce this story of the real rich man.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:21.840]   But God said to him, "You fool, this very night your life will be demanded from you.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.460]   Then you will get what you have prepared for yourself.
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:30.920]   This is how it will be for whoever stores up things for themselves, but is not rich
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.200]   towards God."
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:39.760]   I do want to share something more about Farewell before we finish for the day.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:46.440]   Over 35 years of clinical practice, I had encountered more deaths than probably most
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.040]   of you in the audience.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:59.200]   I find that some departed well prepared, but many others did not.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:10.920]   However, when it became evidence to me that I myself am facing a finite future for myself
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:23.120]   upon diagnosis of blood cancer, I decided to do a good farewell, a joyous one.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:31.040]   I invited different people because I wanted to thank the many people who have poured into
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.600]   my life.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:41.840]   I wanted to appreciate all those who journeyed with us through thick and thin.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:52.880]   I want to encourage all our spiritual sons and daughters that we have shared our life.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:40:04.680]   With that, they may carry on with steadfast trust in God regardless.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:12.360]   And I wanted to share my faith with friends and beloved ones whom have as yet to know
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   Jesus.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   So, in no other places than this auditorium right here, we hosted our anniversary banquet.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:29.280]   A good excuse whereby we are to share our 21st wedding anniversary and we are also there
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.760]   to celebrate life.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:41.360]   But deep in me, there was this sense of farewell and hopefully it is said well ahead of time.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:48.520]   Our anniversary wish was that we might be able to celebrate yet another 25 years of
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.240]   marriage.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:57.520]   But we had indeed celebrated our 30th anniversary not long ago.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:04.160]   And we are still eagerly looking forward to spending time together.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.040]   Living is about giving.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:14.340]   And my desire is that I may continue to give and to give of myself.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:20.160]   In Paul's word, he's pouring his life like a drink offering.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:26.720]   Indeed, I'm already poured out like a drink offering.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:35.520]   Now, church tradition was such that Paul was released after his arrest in Jerusalem and
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.960]   imprisonment in Rome.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:44.920]   He was able to revisit many of his churches and his friends upon the release.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:50.960]   So somehow, a final farewell might not be final.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:59.080]   But that would be God's extra grace and as recipients of his grace, we just need to be
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:07.440]   reminded once again, to give is more blessed than to receive.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.240]   And living is about giving.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.800]   I want to invite all of us to stand.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:24.160]   I've shared this message to encourage all of us to look out for someone else.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:30.580]   There must be someone that you can look out for, that you can shepherd.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:38.800]   So I want to invite all of us to look out for someone standing next to you.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:46.680]   To pray with him for whatever challenges, for whatever free fall that he's experiencing,
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.280]   but you are there to look out for him.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.600]   And likewise, he will pray for you.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:59.360]   It's important time that we practice serving and loving by praying with each other.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:08.040]   So pair up with someone that you don't quite know and pray with him, with her, that God
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:15.880]   will continue to watch over, that he or she will be binded by the Holy Spirit, will be
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:22.480]   binded to Christ, that they will be able to serve and to love others.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.640]   Take your time, pray with each other, commit to each other.
