[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   (gentle piano music)
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:26.840]   When he shall come with trumpet sound,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.480]   and may I then in him be found,
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.880]   dressed only in his righteousness,
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.480]   faultless I stand before his throne.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.240]   The words of that beautiful modern day hymn
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.920]   that we've just heard really resonate
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.280]   with a central theme that we're looking at here
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.600]   in our Advent season at the Vine in 2024.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720]   We've been saying each week, haven't we,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.720]   that Advent is not just about the birth of Christ,
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.160]   it's also about this longing for his return.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.360]   And I love how that song picks up that longing.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.840]   When the trumpets sound, Christ will return to this world.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.460]   And as he returns, his heart is to make this whole world
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.980]   just as he had always planned and designed for it to be.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.080]   We read in that picture in Revelation 21 and 22
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.120]   that he's gonna make all things new,
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.800]   this desire to bring every tribe and tongue
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.880]   and nation together, praising him in a city
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.280]   that will come from heaven down to earth,
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.840]   drawing together all people, no more sin,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840]   no more brokenness, no more death.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.960]   We will all find life to its fullness
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.000]   in the presence of him.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.200]   And I love the way that the writer of that song
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.820]   expresses that sense within them, this idea of confidence.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.020]   They say, here's where my confidence will be on that day.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's not gonna be in me.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.800]   It's not gonna be in how well that I live my life.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.840]   It's not gonna be that I had all the answers
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.760]   and I knew everything and I did the best that I could.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.240]   No, he says, I will be dressed in his righteousness alone.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.000]   In other words, the only thing I'm gonna have on that day,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.680]   the only thing I need to have on that day
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.000]   is not my goodness, not my strength,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.760]   not me having figured it all out.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.780]   It's only in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus,
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.120]   what he's done on the cross,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.880]   how he's paid the price for my sin,
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.240]   how I've come into that forgiveness
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.520]   and redemption for myself.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.560]   And I'm gonna be dressed, not in my righteousness,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.600]   as if I'm dressed in my righteousness on that day,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.920]   things are not gonna go well.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.320]   I'm gonna be dressed in his righteousness alone.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.640]   And if that's the case,
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.020]   then I will be faultless before his throne.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.560]   And so in this beautiful lyrics
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.800]   that we've just been sitting with,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.120]   and sometimes when we sing these songs,
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.600]   we don't actually kind of dig into the theology,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.540]   the beautiful theology that sits behind them.
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.640]   But when we sit in the resonance of that idea,
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.140]   we can kind of pick up what Paul's been saying to us
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.040]   throughout this series about the now, but not yet,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.680]   that we're in and the three things that remain,
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.840]   because the confidence that that writer is speaking about
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.480]   of standing in his righteousness alone,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.400]   that's picking up one of the major themes for Paul
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.440]   that remains for us in this now, but not yet time.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.440]   And that's the theme of hope.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   Ah, yes, hope.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.880]   Paul says that three things do remain
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.520]   when we struggle in the now, but not yet season
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.200]   that we're in, faith, hope, and love.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.840]   And he says the greatest of these is love.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.640]   And next week, we're gonna look at that,
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.200]   and I'm gonna explain why he says
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.600]   the greatest of these is love.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.320]   But although it's true that love
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.720]   is the greatest of what remains,
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.920]   I think the thing that remains the most
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.000]   that we need the most right now is hope.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.080]   I don't know if you've kind of picked this up yourself
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.360]   or not, but I think we're living in what I would say
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.600]   is a time of hope crisis.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.480]   If you just open your ears to the conversations
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.520]   that are happening here in our city,
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.800]   in the cafes and in the lunch spots
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.520]   and in the bars after work and in the restaurants,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.280]   if you kind of listen in to how people are talking,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.240]   you can get a sense that there's a deep sense
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.800]   of helplessness and hopelessness here
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.480]   in our city at the moment.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.560]   I wonder if this resonates a little bit
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.920]   with perhaps how you feel as you think about
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.480]   the future of Hong Kong and think about what it means
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.160]   to be a person that's living here,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.920]   perhaps there's a certain sense
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.000]   of that hopelessness in you too.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.240]   It was really interesting, last week we had
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.960]   our Christmas market and one of the organizations
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.600]   that was a part of the Christmas market was Eden last week.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.880]   And Eden are an anti-trafficking,
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.120]   anti-human trafficking organization.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.800]   And they produce jewelry and they sell this jewelry
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.320]   to help fund the work they do, but they produce a card.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.960]   And when they do markets all over Hong Kong
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.320]   and they're doing them all the time,
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.440]   young people will come to them to look at the stuff
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.800]   that they have, they will give the young people a card
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.760]   and on that card are some words.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.360]   All those words are biblical words,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.800]   although of course the people don't know that,
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.160]   but there are all these biblical words that are on this card
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.600]   and they say to the people, hey, why don't you choose
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.440]   the word that resonates most with you?
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.240]   The word that connects to where you're at right now
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.640]   or perhaps the word that you need the most
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.200]   and then we'll show you the jewelry
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.880]   that's associated with that word.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.080]   And they told me last week and you can probably guess
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.480]   that the single most common word
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.680]   that the young people of our city say to them
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.240]   every time they look at that list
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   is the word, you guessed it, hope.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.320]   It's as if our young people are saying,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.480]   we're not sure where our hope lies anymore.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.920]   We're not sure if we have the hope
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.480]   that we used to think that we had.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.400]   But if we're honest though, it's not just the young people
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.600]   that perhaps are feeling that way,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.680]   I think it's all the generations.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.320]   And in fact, it's not actually even just what's happening
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.480]   here in Hong Kong.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.440]   I mean, if we lift our heads up a little bit
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.520]   from our own city and our own circumstances
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.280]   and we look at around the world around us,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.080]   we can see that actually there's a hope crisis
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.680]   around the whole world.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.480]   That actually the reality is that the conversations
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.360]   are doom and gloom and despair
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.240]   in many parts of the world right now.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.720]   And when you peel back the layer and you look at that
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.400]   and you look at the evidence that's out there,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.800]   you can kind of understand why we're in this hope crisis.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.680]   I mean, it's not like there's nothing going on.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.960]   There's some pretty sad, pretty heavy,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.160]   pretty crazy stuff that's happening in our world right now.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.880]   I mean, levels of exploitation are happening in this world
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.040]   at levels that they've never happened before.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.720]   The poor and the vulnerable and marginalized
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.640]   are being exploited more than ever.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.560]   There's economic disparity in our world
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.000]   at a higher level than ever before.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.160]   That's tracked by the Gini coefficient.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.240]   And the Gini coefficient is higher
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.960]   for the Western developed world than it's ever been.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.200]   The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.160]   And then you look at kind of what's happening
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.480]   within many of the cultures of this world,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.520]   and you can see so much abuse that's taking place,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.360]   so much of a rise in senseless violence,
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.720]   so much exploitation that's happening
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.760]   for those who are vulnerable, hate crimes on the rise,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.520]   gender abuse and gender violence.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.240]   The look at things that are taking place
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.480]   in the wars around the world right now.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.840]   And whenever there's war, here's the thing,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.200]   there's always a group of people that suffer the most,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.280]   and that's the innocents,
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.520]   and mostly that is often children.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.320]   And we're seeing that over the last couple of years.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.000]   If you take a look at the things
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.600]   that are taking place in our world,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.040]   it's understandable perhaps
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.480]   that there is a bit of a hope crisis.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.320]   And here's what I realized
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.000]   that I'm even hearing this amongst us here at the Vine.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.760]   In the conversations that I have with you,
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.280]   in the conversations our pastoral team, we know,
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.800]   there's a great sense of helplessness
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.680]   amongst us as a community.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.440]   It almost feels like hope has been dragged away
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.320]   from many of us in this room.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.480]   Maybe as you're coming to the end of 2024,
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.560]   a lot of you in this room are saying,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.320]   "Thank goodness that year's over,
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.640]   because I've been dragged down, and I've been held back,
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.600]   and I lost my job, and I had that diagnosis,
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.720]   and there's all this stuff that's happening,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.480]   and it hasn't been a great year for me."
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.160]   And the reality is that sense of doom,
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.480]   that sense of gloom, I think it's not just over the world,
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.840]   I think it's over the church.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.520]   And here's what worries me about that.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.320]   Because if there should ever be a group of people
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.520]   in the world right now who could actually stand up
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.080]   and speak about a different way,
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.960]   who could actually begin to communicate
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.920]   that there's another narrative than the doom and the gloom
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.920]   that we're seeing in the world,
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.800]   then surely it should be the church.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.600]   But I have a sense that the church
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.120]   is as hopeless as everybody else.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.240]   And what I wanna do over the next 30 minutes
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.800]   is I wanna light a little fire under us.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.160]   And I wanna actually begin to change your thinking
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.320]   about hope, because I think one of the reasons
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.400]   why the church has become so hopeless in this time
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.680]   when there needs to be a voice of hope
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.800]   is because we've actually come to define hope
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.160]   just like everybody else does in the world.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.520]   I think even the idea of me speaking about hope this morning,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.960]   if you're anything like me,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.080]   that raises some pretty uncomfortable emotions at times.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.240]   That's a pretty complex thing that happens to us.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.560]   Because perhaps some of you are sitting here right now,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.760]   and you've been burnt by hope in the past.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.720]   Maybe you had hope for a season,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.320]   but hope didn't work out for you.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.400]   Maybe you were hoping that that relationship
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.560]   that was going on in your life,
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.800]   you were hoping that that got better,
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.960]   but it didn't get better.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.760]   Maybe you were hoping to get a job this year,
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.680]   a job that you've always wanted and always dreamt for,
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.840]   and you had endless interviews, but nobody hired you.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.280]   Or maybe there was a debt
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.080]   that you were hoping to pay off this year,
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.680]   and you didn't manage to pay it off,
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.360]   and you're wondering why.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.880]   Or maybe you were trying to lead some people
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.960]   to faith this year, and they didn't come to faith,
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.040]   and you're beginning to ask questions.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.200]   Or maybe you're grappling in a relationship,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.240]   and you thought that that relationship would sort it out.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.960]   Maybe there's a dispute going on,
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.400]   and you had great hope that 2024 would be the year
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.480]   when you would finally sort out that relationship,
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.760]   and it hasn't been sorted out,
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.800]   and you're entering into the new year
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.080]   with as much gloom about that as anything else.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.040]   And all these things that you had been hoping for,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.640]   nothing seems to have changed,
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.080]   nothing seems to have happened,
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.240]   nothing has come through.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.440]   And if you're feeling like that,
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.080]   well, I feel like that a lot too.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.640]   'Cause we are burnt at times by hope.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.480]   And when you're burnt by hope,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.120]   it makes you not even wanna think about it.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.520]   And then when somebody like me starts to talk about it,
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.760]   you immediately kind of go,
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.800]   ah, I don't wanna be set up for failure again.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.200]   Like, I'm not sure about this hope thing.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.560]   I tried it, I tried it out,
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.680]   but it didn't quite work out for me.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.760]   And I think as Christians,
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.200]   we have a tension that sits within us.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.160]   'Cause we have this thought, don't we?
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.720]   That hope is a good thing,
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.360]   that this should be a good thing.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.920]   The idea of hope is good.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.480]   And yet the reality of our lives
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.200]   sometimes doesn't seem to add up to that.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.000]   And we kind of sit within this tension
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.520]   between a good idea of hope
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.000]   and the reality that hope hasn't often come through for us.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.600]   And as Christians, we wrestle with that,
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.240]   and we're not quite sure what to do with it.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.920]   So when the topic of hope comes up,
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.640]   we kind of silence our voices.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.160]   And I think a lot of reasons for this
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.560]   is because we are beginning to define hope
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.200]   the same way that society sees hope.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.040]   Let me explain.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.640]   Society, I think, essentially defines hope this way,
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.280]   that hope is an expressed desire
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.120]   for a positive outcome that is uncertain.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.200]   Let me give an example.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.000]   My daughter Mia, who's 14 years old,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.560]   she this year is hoping for an iPad for Christmas.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.760]   Now, when my daughter hopes for an iPad for Christmas,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.360]   here's what she really means.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.760]   "I have no idea if mom and dad are gonna buy me an iPad,
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.440]   "but I hope that they do.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.760]   "I'm putting all my trust and all my hope
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.320]   "in something that is kind of uncertain,
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.560]   "but I'm hoping they'll come through for me."
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.600]   She doesn't know whether we're buying her one or not.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.960]   By the way, she's not in this service.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.040]   Let me just tell you, that's a false hope.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.200]   We are not buying her an iPad this Christmas.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.720]   Have you seen how expensive iPads are?
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.800]   I know, give me money, I will buy one.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.840]   We're not buying her an iPad.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.200]   That's a false hope, it's not happening.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.720]   Or maybe you're sitting there and you think,
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.600]   "I hope Pastor Andrew only preaches for 15 minutes today,
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.160]   "'cause I wanna get out there and eat my cookies."
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.440]   What you're really meaning by that is,
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.560]   "I have no idea how long Pastor Andrew's going
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.400]   "to be preaching for.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.440]   "I desire that it would be short,
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.320]   "but the fact that I've been coming to the Vine for so long,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.200]   "I'll know that he'll probably go on for hours."
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.080]   But I had this expressed desire for it.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.360]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.000]   So hope is so often defined by this positive thing
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.160]   that I wanna happen,
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.520]   but I have no certainty that it's gonna happen.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.880]   So hope becomes so uncertain.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.320]   And when hope is defined essentially by uncertainties,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.800]   by kinda, "I'm gonna throw a dart at a dartboard
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.880]   "and kinda hope that I'll hit a good number or whatever,
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.400]   "but I just don't know."
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.360]   Well, then when somebody says,
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.440]   "Hey, put your life into hope," you're like,
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.240]   "Hmm, I don't know if I should trust something
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.880]   "that is so out there."
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.520]   It raises a very important question for us.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.480]   Why would I put my faith in something as flimsy,
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.560]   as uncertain, as doubtful as a hope?
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.200]   Are you with me?
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.440]   So because this is the case, here's what I've discovered.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.200]   Christians don't really talk about hope very much.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.440]   I mean, this fascinated me.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.400]   I went to Bible school, to seminary for four years.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.080]   We never did a class on hope.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.000]   Faith, we did a lot of classes on faith, okay?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.400]   Love, we nailed love.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.720]   We talked about love all the time.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.120]   We never once talked about hope.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.080]   The only time that hope was mentioned at my seminary
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.360]   was by the teachers,
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.400]   because one of my classmates' first name was Hope.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.920]   That was the only time when they ever mentioned
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.080]   the word hope.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.640]   Us Christians, we don't talk about it
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.080]   'cause I think we're uncomfortable with it, and here's why.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.440]   Because we're defining it in the same way
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.080]   that society defines it,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.200]   and if hope is a desired positive outcome
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.760]   that is kind of uncertain,
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.120]   we don't wanna set people up for failure,
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.240]   so we've quietened our voice at the very time
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.440]   where the world needs to hear about hope again.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.760]   The very people that should have the best thing to say
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.920]   about it are just not speaking up.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.880]   Here's the funny thing.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.480]   The Bible has a lot to say about hope.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.120]   In fact, hope is mentioned over 600 times in our scriptures.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.600]   Pretty much every book of the Bible
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.160]   has some sort of teaching or thought on hope.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.680]   When you get to the New Testament,
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.960]   every second or third page in the New Testament
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.120]   speaks about this idea of hope.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.800]   The Bible is filled with it.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.320]   We should be filled with it.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.800]   Paul, riding into the church,
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.280]   trying to help them to wrestle with this Advent thing
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.120]   that we've been talking about,
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.520]   the now but not yet, that Christ has come,
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.560]   that He is coming back, we're living in the in-between.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.120]   Paul rides into his church,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.160]   and he desperately wants them to understand
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   that hope is a good thing, that hope is alive,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.640]   that hope can change everything.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.720]   But his church, like us today,
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.920]   are wrestling with the flimsy,
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.240]   uncertain kind of weirdness to hope.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.280]   And so he writes in and he says,
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.720]   look, over 36 times in his letters,
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.200]   he mentions hope, 36 times.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.400]   And every time he mentions hope,
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.280]   it's always embedded in a very important part of the letter
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.800]   and what he's trying to teach his church.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.240]   And what I wanna do today is show you one of those moments
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.800]   'cause out of it, I wanna draw for you
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.920]   a better way of thinking about hope.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.840]   And if you've walked in here today,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.080]   again, a little bit like how I often wrestle with it,
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.280]   thinking like, when has hope ever done anything good for me?
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.040]   My prayer is that as you leave today,
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.240]   you will leave refreshed and renewed
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.080]   to become the voice that I think God
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.800]   is actually calling you to be
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.400]   in a time of a crisis of hope.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.560]   Paul writes to one of his prodigies, a guy called Titus.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.120]   You may not have looked at the book of Titus
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.400]   in the New Testament much, it's a very short book.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.040]   Paul is writing to a man
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.400]   that he had spent a lot of time raising up,
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.040]   one of his prodigies, if you will.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.160]   He was a church planter and a pastor in Crete,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.800]   which is a small little island
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.760]   in the middle of the Mediterranean Ocean.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.400]   And Paul writes to him and speaks to him
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.440]   about this idea of hope.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.600]   There's just three verses, chapter two,
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.080]   starting in verse 11, let me read this to you.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.880]   For the grace of God has appeared
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.800]   that brings salvation to all people.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.280]   It teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.920]   and to live self-controlled and upright godly lives
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.720]   in this present age.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.640]   While we wait, notice this, for the blessed hope,
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   the glorious appearance or the appearance of glory
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.320]   of our great God and savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.520]   In just these three verses,
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.840]   Paul does something that he does
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.960]   in many places in his writings.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.080]   He often, in just three verses,
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.680]   gives you something that's in the past,
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.720]   something in the present and something in the future.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.600]   And you can see that when we break down the passage here.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.040]   He's got something about what's happened in the past,
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.680]   something that should impact what's going on in the present.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.080]   And then he leans us forward to the future.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.680]   This is Paul's now but not yet tension
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.400]   in the time in which we live in.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.640]   Christ has come, we're living in this time
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.480]   and Christ is coming.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.320]   And that's the second thing, notice,
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.280]   he speaks about the appearance of God
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.960]   in the first place in the past.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   That's speaking about his first advent, his first coming.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.720]   And then he speaks about at the end,
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.000]   his glory of his second return.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.400]   That's speaking about the end of all things.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.640]   And Paul is wanting his church to understand
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.360]   that they're living in this time between those two events.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.320]   But then notice what he says remains.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.080]   This is kind of a parallel passage
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.800]   to that 1 Corinthians 13 passage.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.280]   He says, "There is a blessed hope."
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.520]   I love that phrase, blessed hope.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.520]   Because like I was saying earlier,
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.720]   I think so often we think hope is cursed.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.560]   Oh, we tried, we hoped, it didn't work out.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.560]   And we got burnt again and hope didn't come through.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.400]   Paul's writing and saying,
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.640]   "No, you need to begin to think differently about hope
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.720]   'cause hope is not cursed, hope is blessed.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.440]   Hope is a blessing, hope brings blessing.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.040]   And when we begin to understand the power that is in hope,
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.880]   it changes the way you begin to think.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.360]   And rather than the church being sort of alongside
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.680]   of the rest of the world and thinking that hope is cursed,
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.120]   the church could raise up and begin to be a blessing
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.360]   in a time of crisis.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.920]   Now, he's saying this is a blessed hope
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.800]   because Paul is teaching and understanding something
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.440]   that we all need to understand.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.960]   Paul is not placing his hope in circumstance.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.760]   He's not placing his hope here in some positive thinking
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.520]   or a way of having kind of better thoughts about something.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.800]   He's not even placing hope within himself.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.400]   Oh, I know what God has done in me, or I know who I am,
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.840]   or I know what I used to be,
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.280]   but I also know who I am today.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.480]   And that gives me great hope.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.600]   Not even in himself.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.080]   He's saying the only place where hope can be found
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.720]   is in the one who is certain, the one who is all loving,
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.560]   the one who's all good, our hope is blessed
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.360]   'cause it's not found in our circumstances, our situations,
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.240]   it's found in the one who's never changing.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.560]   It's found in him, in God.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.560]   God is hope.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.480]   In other words, Paul is saying God doesn't give hope,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.840]   God is hope.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.040]   And when you begin to shift your thinking away from,
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.000]   hey, my hope is in something that's uncertain,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.440]   of course, that's gonna be cursed most of the time,
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.360]   but when you place your hope in the certainty
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.880]   of the one who never changes, then your hope becomes blessed.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.040]   Paul would write differently to the church in Colossae,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:23.880]   and he would say, look,
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.520]   you've got to understand it like this.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.160]   I know what it is to be wealthy.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.760]   I know what it is to be poor.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.240]   I know what it is to be hungry.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.600]   I know what it is to be well-fed.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.000]   I know what it is to be shipwrecked.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   I know what it is to be safe.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.080]   He goes through all this list,
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.920]   and he says, no matter the circumstance in my life,
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.360]   I have come to learn what it is to be content
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.120]   in any circumstance.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.120]   He's talking about blessed hope,
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.400]   and he's holding onto this concept of hope being blessed
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.520]   because he's placing it not in uncertainty,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.400]   but in what is certain.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.360]   My daughter is placing her hope
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.240]   in the uncertainty of Chris and I's bank account,
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.920]   and that is very uncertain.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.000]   I can let you know that now.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.720]   Paul's not making that mistake.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.000]   He's placing his hope in the only one
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.960]   that can be the fullness of that hope,
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.920]   and that's a beautiful, glorious, good thing.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.080]   Ah, hope is blessed, he's saying.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.440]   Hope is not in us.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.080]   It's not in circumstance, as it's saying here behind me.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   It's not in just idea of positive thinking.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.320]   It's not in kind of facts that kind of work themselves out.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.720]   No, hope is only ever in this unchanging, lovable,
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.880]   this incredibly purposeful God who speaks truth
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.120]   and can only speak truth.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.760]   That's where our hope is found.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.240]   Are you with me?
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.360]   Now, as we begin to place our hope in that,
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.680]   he says, this is a blessed hope,
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.800]   and he said, you need to realize why this hope is blessed,
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.280]   and this is where he speaks about two incredible things.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.240]   He goes back to the first advent of Christ,
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.160]   and I want you to notice the word he uses.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.880]   He says, there is the grace of God appeared to us before.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.440]   So he uses a word to link that summarizes
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.840]   what it is that God did in his first advent.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.520]   He calls it grace.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.200]   In other words, that Jesus was born
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.120]   in that stable in Bethlehem,
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.760]   that Jesus grew up to inaugurate the kingdom,
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.120]   that Jesus went to the cross to die for our sins,
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.200]   that, he's saying, is a story of grace,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.120]   and because God came before,
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.520]   our hope is based in a story of grace.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.000]   This grace means that if you align your heart and your life
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.440]   to the saving power of Jesus,
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.800]   if you recognize that he went to that cross
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.000]   to pay for your sin,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.120]   he did that whilst you were still a sinner.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.320]   He did that before you even knew him.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.120]   He so loved you that he responded to you
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.240]   before you even knew that you needed him
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.600]   to be responding to.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.520]   That's the story of grace,
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.880]   and Paul's saying your hope is founded on the root
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.280]   of this crazy idea that God's grace saves you,
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.040]   changes you, transforms you, equips you,
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.280]   and it's all because you didn't earn it,
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.880]   you didn't do something good for it.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.800]   Even when you were still in the darkest depths of your sin,
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.480]   he came and loved you.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.280]   That's grace.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.000]   So he's like, understand that your hope is not arbitrary.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.880]   That hope came at a high price.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.280]   It came at the gift of the grace of a God
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.200]   who sent his son to die for your sins.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.800]   Blessed hope, he says.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.640]   But it's not just based in grace.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.560]   He then takes us to the return of Christ
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.600]   at the end of all things,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.920]   and he uses a different word.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.480]   He says when he comes back, you will see glory.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.240]   So he says our story of hope
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.760]   starts in this grace that's brought to us,
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.080]   but it's completed in this glory that comes
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.280]   when Christ returns.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.720]   The glorification of the whole redemptive story
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.680]   that what Christ began in his birth and in his life
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.320]   and in his death and his resurrection only gets completed
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   when he comes back to this world
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.480]   to restore and renew all things.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.320]   That is when we get to see him in the glory.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.480]   And Paul's saying your hope
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.720]   is not just founded in the grace story,
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.960]   it's also founded in the glory story.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.160]   In fact, if he doesn't return,
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.200]   that's an issue for the grace story.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.240]   The grace story finds its fullness
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.720]   in the glory story of him coming back.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.760]   The God who came to you in grace
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.520]   is returning to you in glory.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.640]   And as you begin to really wrestle
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.480]   with the wonder of a God who is grace
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.560]   at the start of my story and glory at the end of it,
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.560]   then everything in between begins to fall into place.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.320]   It doesn't mean, like Paul to the church in Colossae,
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.720]   that everything's gonna work out perfect.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.120]   Doesn't mean that suddenly my circumstances
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.240]   are all gonna be perfect.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.320]   Doesn't mean that I'm gonna get that iPad for Christmas.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.160]   She's not.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:50.520]   What it does mean is that if I have Jesus at the start
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.520]   and I have Jesus at the end,
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.160]   then I can have Jesus right now.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.880]   It means that I can have a relationship
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   with this blessed hope that can raise in my spirit
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.720]   something that is different from the doom and the gloom
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.760]   and the despair that I see in this world.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.080]   And I can begin to live on behalf of a hope,
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.960]   a glorious hope that's coming in the here and now.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.760]   It's like Jesus said, "I'm the alpha and the omega,
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.120]   the first and the last."
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.040]   What he's basically saying is,
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.640]   "If you have me at your start,
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.360]   and if you're gonna have me at your end,
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.760]   then you have nothing to worry about in between."
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.320]   Doesn't mean that everything's gonna be perfect for you.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.640]   It's gonna be some challenges.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.480]   It's gonna be tough.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.320]   It's gonna be hard.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.960]   You will not go through it alone.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.800]   I am Emmanuel, God with you.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.040]   I'm at your start.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.360]   I'm at your end.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.640]   Everything else is in between.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.640]   And Paul says, "This is blessed."
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.720]   He's like, "Could you imagine the privilege
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.360]   that it is to live in this time?"
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.580]   Imagine a church that would say,
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.040]   "Isn't it such a privilege to live in a time
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.480]   when everybody is doom and gloom?"
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.080]   'Cause then I've got something to say.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.200]   I've got a hope to speak of.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.480]   I've got a light that can shine,
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.540]   and that light shines brightest
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.320]   when it's pretty dark out there.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.440]   It's interesting because it's not just Paul
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.600]   that speaks this way.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.600]   There are writers throughout the New Testament
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   that hold this idea of hope being this caught between time
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.580]   of the beginning and the end and the joy it is to live now.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.100]   Let me just jump out of Paul for a second,
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.260]   take you to 1 Peter,
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.460]   and the apostle Peter is speaking here
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.700]   about the same kind of thing Paul's speaking about.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.740]   Let me read this to you from 1 Peter 1, verse 3.
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.580]   Praise be to the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.060]   for in his great mercy, he has given to us,
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.300]   notice this, new birth into a living hope.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.820]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.960]   Christ has given us this grace that's appeared,
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.800]   has given us this new birth into a living hope
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.240]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.880]   and into an inheritance
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.980]   that can never perish, spoil, or fade,
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.960]   kept in heaven just for you,
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.120]   who through faith are shielded by God's power
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.480]   until the coming of the salvation
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.280]   that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.360]   Can you hear what Peter's saying here?
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.040]   It's so similar to what Paul's saying.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.360]   In fact, let me just bring the two things side by side here
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.480]   so you can see them next to each other.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.200]   Peter is speaking very similarly to Paul here.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.760]   He's saying, look, we've got to understand
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.800]   that Christ has come and in his death and his resurrection,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.420]   he started a new life.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.680]   We, if we're in relationship with him,
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.360]   can have a new birth into what he calls a living hope.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.480]   In other words, it's not just a hope
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.880]   that's anchored to the starting point of Christ in the past.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.880]   It's not just a hope that's for us
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.740]   in the future at some point.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.040]   No, he's saying the hope has resonance today.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.880]   The hope brings life and is alive in us right here and now.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.360]   And he's saying that hope is becoming
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.200]   because of this inheritance we have in Christ
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.880]   that we will be shielded by the power of God
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.440]   until we get there on that day
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.220]   and we will realize that we are dressed
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.200]   in his righteousness alone,
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.160]   so we'll have confidence to stand before the throne.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.640]   That's a living hope that actually has pay,
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.980]   payback to our lives right here and now.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.100]   Paul writes the same thing in the Titus passage.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.980]   Look at verse 12 here.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.180]   He says, here's what this blessed hope does.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.020]   It teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.140]   and to live a self-controlled, upright,
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.260]   and godly life in this present age.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.740]   See, both Paul and Peter don't want you to think
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.940]   that hope was for the past and it's only for the future.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.240]   They want you to realize that this hope is alive
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.880]   right here and right now.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.200]   It's a living hope, it's a blessed hope,
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.080]   and when you get that hope, guess what?
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.360]   You have the ability to say no,
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.560]   to say no to exploitation that you see in the world,
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.060]   to say no to rampant consumerism,
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.880]   to say no to the injustices that you see,
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.680]   injustices out there, but also injustices in here.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.480]   It enables me to say no to ungodly passions
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.160]   that come up within me.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.480]   It enables me to be more self-controlled.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.960]   It enables me that when my life doesn't go well,
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.200]   sure, I feel the pain of that, the hurt of that.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.960]   I'm impacted by that.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.920]   I want my life to go well, and when it doesn't,
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.560]   that hurts and it's difficult, but I can be self-controlled.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.840]   I can begin to live in a way that actually puts
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.040]   the blessed hope of the past and the future
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.800]   right into work in the present right now.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.760]   Could you imagine a church that is not confined
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.400]   to thinking that hope is uncertain and a curse,
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.640]   but that hope was alive and true
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.760]   and meant something right here in Hong Kong
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:55.920]   when so many people are crying out for hope?
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:02.200]   It's interesting to me because the hope
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.960]   that the world is speaking about, this societal hope,
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.160]   is so whimsical and such the power of positive thinking.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.560]   And Paul's saying here, you need to understand
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.680]   that biblical hope is not the power of positive thinking.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.720]   It's not thinking better about your life
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.040]   or thinking better about the future and going,
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.440]   I just hope things get better in the future.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.240]   He's like, also, biblical hope is not naive.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.340]   It's not the sort of hope that shuts its eyes
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.320]   to the problems of the world.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.560]   It's not a hope that's trying to bury its head in the sand
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.000]   and kind of pretend like it doesn't really matter.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.760]   Hope in the Bible is not gathering in a building like this
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.160]   and kind of cushioning ourselves from the evil in the world.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.040]   That's not biblical hope.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.880]   Biblical hope lights a fire inside of us
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.600]   to be able to live in a new and a fresh way,
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.280]   representing the heart of God
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.280]   in the darkness that's around us.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.600]   Hope, biblically, is not shy about the pain
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.120]   and the suffering of this world.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.820]   Hope welcomes us into the process of lament,
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.560]   where we lament together on what we're seeing
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.280]   in this now but not yet,
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.800]   longing for the time when glory will appear,
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.300]   grateful for the fact that grace has already come,
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.760]   living in the wonder between those two things
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.440]   and declaring to the world
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.560]   that there is a better day ahead.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.720]   That's a beautiful thing.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.960]   That's how I think Paul wanted his church to be.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.080]   I think it's how God wants his church to be today.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.240]   Christians should be the most hopeful people on the planet
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.280]   and in an hour like this,
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.640]   we should be rising up and finding our voice.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.640]   It's important you understand that this sort of hope
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.300]   is what the Christmas story is all about.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.460]   This is really interesting.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.920]   I don't know if you've ever thought of the Christmas story
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.280]   by like stripping out all of the kind of like decorations
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.880]   and the gifts and the celebrations
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.160]   and the nice carols and all of that
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.540]   and just actually looked at the rawness
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.440]   of what Christmas is all about.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.280]   At the very heart of it,
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.400]   the Christmas story is essentially a story
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.160]   of a teenage crisis pregnancy.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.200]   It's a story of a young girl who finds herself pregnant
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.520]   without having ever slept with a man
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.960]   and the reality of the shame
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.400]   that that was gonna bring upon her and her fiance,
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.640]   the person that she was pledged to be married to
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.240]   but had not actually gotten married and had not had sex
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.200]   and suddenly she finds herself in a place of pregnancy
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.640]   which even today is a vulnerable thing
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.840]   but that was even more of a vulnerable thing back then.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.500]   I mean, you can imagine almost the whispers
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.500]   of the people around them in Nazareth at the time,
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.180]   I told you that those two were getting together.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.620]   I told you they were doing some dodgy stuff
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.600]   after that party last week.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.760]   Look at what's happened.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:52.260]   These guys are so ungodly, so broken, so horrible.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.020]   So this is a story of a young girl who's done nothing wrong
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.980]   and has to live in the shame
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.320]   of everybody pointing her finger at her.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.060]   Not only that, but she's pledged to be married
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.700]   to a working class man who's a carpenter
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.460]   who ends up actually living
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.820]   and they're living in a small town in a small country
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.820]   that's under oppression by a major dominant empire.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.980]   Not only that, but their freedoms are not their own.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.540]   We hear in the story that if her pregnancy
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.480]   and the shame of that was not worse enough,
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.900]   they didn't have to uproot themselves
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.860]   and move to another place that they did not know
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.380]   although it was the fiance's family home
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.000]   in this place called Bethlehem.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.020]   They didn't know it, but they had to go there
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.620]   because a census was taking place.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.440]   And when they got there, here was their hope.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.580]   Their hope was that family members that lived there
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.420]   of the fiance would open their doors to them
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.660]   and welcome them in because she was heavenly pregnant.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.100]   And they get there and guess what happens?
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.060]   Their very flesh and blood,
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.500]   their relatives refused to let them in
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.660]   even though I'm sure they had plenty of space
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.980]   in their own homes because they didn't want
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.700]   to be associated with the shame
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.200]   of an unmarried pregnant teenage girl.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.940]   Oh, we talk about it like there was no room in the inn.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.340]   The reality is none of the family would let them in.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.940]   And so they have to go to this cave.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.080]   Mangers, again, on the Hallmark Christmas cards
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.260]   look so pretty and nice and clean, don't they?
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.140]   They were basically caves that happened
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.660]   under the houses themselves where the animals
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.160]   would be to stay warm in winter under the house.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.020]   So literally Mary and Joseph go to a cave,
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:30.180]   a dark, damp place, and they have their child there.
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.900]   And you could imagine for the mother
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.700]   that this was not how she had planned anything to be.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.420]   This is not circumstances how she wanted it to be.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.340]   But she brings her child into the world
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.780]   in less than perfect circumstances.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.440]   But she has this audacious thought
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.620]   that her child was special.
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.460]   And she believed that the location of his birth
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.160]   did not determine his destiny or his future.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.220]   And really the rawness of the Christmas story
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.380]   tells us this, that no matter how bleak
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.440]   circumstances might seem, even though the bad guys
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.540]   are currently in power, even though winners
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.400]   are lording it over losers, even though even family members
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.160]   are rejecting you and hurting you,
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:15.500]   that anything that's happening right now is not permanent.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.620]   That God is able to bring his child and his presence
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.020]   into the midst of that right here and now.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.220]   And Emmanuel, God with us, can change everything.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:30.100]   If the Christmas story is anything, it's a story of hope.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:34.020]   Hope in the darkest of circumstances.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.520]   That's a story that the world needs to hear again.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:43.280]   And the church carries with it, in its heart,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.340]   that story of hope.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.420]   That all of us have been marked by that story,
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.280]   that we all realize that we're a dark, damp cave,
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.620]   if you will, but if Jesus can be born in Bethlehem,
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.740]   he can certainly be born in the coldness of my heart.
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.380]   That he can come and make new life and new home in me.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.100]   That the place of that birth in me
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.900]   can make me into a living hope.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.820]   A hope that now stands before the world
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.540]   and says the story of Jesus in his grace
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.660]   and the story of his coming in his glory
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.980]   is the story that I want my life to represent.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.020]   No matter how difficult things might be around us,
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.660]   I want my life to speak of something better
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.940]   than what is currently seen.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.740]   See, Jesus would go on to inaugurate his kingdom
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.100]   and he would teach what that kingdom would look like,
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.140]   turning everything upside down from the doom and gloom
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.980]   that's seen in the world.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.520]   He would teach that the first would be last,
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.700]   that the last would be first.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.140]   He would teach that the lowly would be lifted up
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.220]   and that the hungry would be fed.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.700]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.500]   He taught that those who are mighty right now
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.460]   would be thrown off their thrones
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.220]   and that the proud would be scattered in their thoughts.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.320]   He taught actually that it would be the meek
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.020]   that would inherit the earth,
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.340]   not those with guns or power.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.100]   He said that those who are mourning right now,
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.500]   who are overwhelmed by a diagnosis,
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.300]   who are wondering when they're gonna get that job,
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.300]   who are wondering what purpose they have for being here,
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.060]   who are struggling with the depths
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.240]   of the things that are there,
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.440]   the realities of their life,
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.860]   that even those that are really struggling right now,
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.180]   they will be comforted, he said.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.260]   And Jesus starts this story
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:28.660]   because he's birthing new living hope in his people
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.580]   and he wants his church to stand on behalf of that.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.740]   You've gotta understand that this is hope.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.660]   The idea that we believe in the coming vision
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:42.100]   of the kingdom to come and we live on behalf of it now.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.740]   This is hope, that even though we're surrounded
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.800]   by some of that story of suffering and pain,
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.700]   we realize that we can bear witness today
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.120]   to the power of our God to bring salvation
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.480]   and bring justice and bring healing
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.580]   and bring liberation to those that need it.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:04.160]   This is hope, that even though we're surrounded right now
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.400]   by the story of death, the story of life
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.820]   can still make its voice heard,
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.040]   that we might join with Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.320]   and say that we're gonna carve a little stone of hope
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.900]   out of the mountain of despair.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:23.680]   This is hope and it's hope not because we're better
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.000]   or we've done something or we've earned it,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.420]   it's hope because it's found in the person
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.480]   that Christmas speaks of, this Jesus,
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.240]   all loving, all good, all personable, present here,
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.540]   the Emmanuel, God with us, walking beside us,
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.960]   living for us, inaugurating the kingdom,
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.280]   paying the price for our sin,
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.520]   raising from the death, coming together,
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.320]   now coming in his glory at the end of all things
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.360]   and we stand in the middle and we say,
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.640]   what a time to be alive.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.120]   This is hope.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.560]   We have something to offer the world
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.800]   in the pain that it's in.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.400]   And here's what that hope should do in and for us.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.360]   It should give us a divinely inspired urgency
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.480]   to live like Jesus.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.000]   The hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.560]   to decide that we're going to move out of passive comfort
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.000]   and into costly solidarity with the poor
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.040]   and the broken and the vulnerable.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.240]   This kind of hope challenges us,
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.680]   that we should persevere when life takes a hard turn,
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.600]   when the news comes against us and the diagnosis is present
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.800]   and the job isn't there, whatever it is,
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.880]   when life is so pulling against us
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.360]   that we have this ability to persevere,
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.840]   even though we of course long for a change
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.560]   in our circumstance, that we join with Paul
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.080]   and we say, I've learned the secret of being content
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.560]   no matter what happens because my trust
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.960]   and my ultimate hope is not found
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   in some change of circumstance,
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.720]   it's found in the grace and the glory
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.080]   of the one that I love.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.400]   That I might find myself lifted out of myself
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.680]   and towards hope again.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.680]   I think this hope teaches us that those who hope
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.360]   in the Lord will renew their strength,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.760]   that they will rise up on wings like eagles,
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.120]   that they will run and not grow weary.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:27.780]   This sort of hope shows us, teaches us, empowers us
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:31.560]   to understand that we can be steadfast in this life,
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.720]   that when opposition comes to the things that we believe
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.200]   and think about, that when oppression comes
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   to the church body as a whole,
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.960]   that when we're facing perhaps in some years ahead here,
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.920]   some of the challenges to how we think
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.040]   or some of the challenges to what we believe,
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.880]   we can find a living hope within us
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.760]   that produces within us a steadfastness
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.960]   to stand against whatever power of oppression may come,
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.240]   that we would join with scripture and say,
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.880]   we might be hard pressed on every side,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.760]   but we are not crushed.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.920]   We might be perplexed, but we are not in despair.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.520]   We might be persecuted, but we're not abandoned.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.840]   We might be knocked down, but we are not crushed
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.120]   because there is a living hope within us.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.320]   And I think this living hope does this.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.300]   I think it makes us begin to reimagine a world today
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.760]   that might look like the one that is to come,
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.400]   knowing that not until when Jesus gets back
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.480]   will it ever be the way it truly should be.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.400]   We're not gonna see perfection here
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.140]   in the right here and now,
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.160]   but we can look towards that vision and say,
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.120]   I wanna think about and begin to build a society today
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.920]   where everybody has dignity, everybody is loved,
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   where everybody has right opportunity,
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.800]   where everybody feels the hope and the comfort
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.640]   and the love of an all loving father,
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.260]   where exploitation is spoken about and dealt with,
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.640]   where hate is spoken out against and dealt with,
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.240]   where we actually begin to align our values
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.440]   with the things that we know is on the heart of God
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.960]   and we produce something within us
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:11.260]   that says something hopeful to the world.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.880]   That's a church I think many people
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.120]   would wanna be a part of.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.080]   May we find our voice.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.320]   And I wanna give you some homework
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.560]   to help you to do that in the week ahead.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.260]   Get out your phones, take a photo of this slide right now.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.720]   In general, would you describe yourself
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.200]   as hopeful person or not?
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.380]   Why or why not?
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:39.160]   Number two, where currently in your life have you lost hope?
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.000]   Why do you think this might be the case?
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.400]   Number three, biblical hope is rooted
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.500]   in both grace and glory.
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.160]   Which of these might be lacking more
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.520]   in your current understanding of hope?
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.700]   And then finally four,
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.860]   biblical hope is not only future focused,
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.100]   but a living hope that invites us to bear witness
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.920]   to God's kingdom in the here and now.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.880]   So where do you sense the Holy Spirit
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.720]   is inviting you to do this in your life?
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.280]   And what might that look like?
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.960]   Paul writes this beautiful thing to the church in Rome
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   when he's talking to them about hope and a living hope.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.080]   He says these beautiful words.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.400]   He says this, he says,
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.840]   and this is kind of like his prayer for the church.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.320]   He's like, "May the hope of the Lord,
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.300]   "the Lord of all hope,
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.420]   "may he birth this joy and grace within you
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.220]   "as you trust in him,
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.900]   "so that you might overflow with hope
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.400]   "by the power of the Holy Spirit."
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.280]   And if there was ever a prayer on my heart
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.980]   for us as a church community
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.040]   at a time of hope crisis in the world,
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.680]   where despair seems to be so commonly spoken about,
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.160]   that we might actually be the ones who overflow with hope,
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.300]   because the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.120]   The hope isn't in us.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.440]   The hope isn't in uncertainty.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.120]   It's certainly not in some better positive thinking.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.320]   It's certainly not in some change in circumstance.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:02.900]   Our hope only is in the grace and the glory of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.040]   I hope that's been hopeful for you.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.240]   Can we pray?
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.080]   Let's pray.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:13.400]   Father, I'm just so grateful for the people in this room
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.480]   who carry within them a living hope.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:22.580]   And Lord, we recognize that the church is often quiet,
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.400]   that we do so often define hope just like society does.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.880]   And because we define hope that way,
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.560]   we don't talk about it very much.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.880]   Hope is an embarrassment rather than a badge of honor.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.720]   Father, we come to you now in this moment,
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.320]   thankful that Paul and Peter and others
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.880]   can help us to reimagine and reconnect
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:53.120]   to what blessed hope, living hope looks like.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:58.120]   A hope that's not focused on our strength,
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.640]   our goodness, having it all together.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:06.580]   A hope that's untethered from the changes of circumstance
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.540]   as much as we may long for them.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:13.320]   A hope that is found in the unchanging,
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.900]   loving and purposeful arms of the Father.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:21.720]   Father, I pray for people in this room
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.120]   who maybe came in today and they've been weighed down
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.720]   by brokenness in their past.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:32.000]   Maybe something's happened to them, no fault of their own,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.600]   but something happened to them in their past
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.240]   and they're still carrying the trauma with that today.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.320]   Or perhaps in their past,
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.920]   they went through some really difficult times
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.620]   because of some choices they made.
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:46.040]   Maybe some mistakes, things that they regret,
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.980]   perhaps even some sin that they wrestled with
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.640]   that led to some pretty poor choices
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.360]   and some harsh circumstances.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:57.440]   Father, if anybody's come in today with a pain
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.560]   when it comes to their past,
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.000]   Lord, I thank you that you spoke to us of hope
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.800]   that's founded in grace today.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.040]   And Lord, I wanna pray for anyone
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.760]   where that's a reality for them in this moment,
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.400]   that Lord, your spirit would minister them right now
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.920]   in a place of hope,
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.800]   that your grace would fall upon them again
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   and that grace would remind them
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.880]   that they are forgiven from that brokenness,
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.720]   forgiven from the mistakes they made,
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.680]   forgiven from the sin of the past,
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.160]   forgiven and wiped clean
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.240]   that what was before a stain before you
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.760]   is now white as snow.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.400]   Lord, those that are struggling from a trauma in the past
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.000]   that was not their fault,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.400]   I pray that your grace would cover that multitude
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.360]   for them as well.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.600]   I pray that your grace would reach into the depths
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.680]   of where they're at
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.520]   and begin that process of healing and renewal and life.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:50.760]   Lord, anyone where they're broken by their past,
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.840]   Lord, we pray for the hope that is found
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.240]   in the grace of Christ.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.480]   Lord, for those in this room
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.240]   that are really worried about the future,
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:03.040]   Lord, where they're anxious about what's ahead,
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.920]   maybe their health gives them a bad picture of what's ahead.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.120]   Maybe the lack of a job and the pressures of finance
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.960]   gives them a stress and anxiety about what's ahead.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.320]   Maybe they're looking for that full life relationship,
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.440]   that person they're gonna spend
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.480]   the rest of their life with
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.320]   and that person hasn't come along yet
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.240]   and they're wondering if it ever will.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.040]   Father, for those in this room
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.160]   that are anxious about their future,
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.000]   Lord, I wanna pray for the hope
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.360]   that is founded in the glory of Christ Jesus.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.440]   The hope that is found in the sure fact
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.800]   that Jesus is returning to this world again.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.560]   And when he does, all brokenness is dealt with,
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.320]   sin is gone, death no more.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.720]   That there is healing and restoration for all,
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.600]   that all things are made new.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.400]   That when we live in the beauty of the glory
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.800]   of the return of Christ,
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.480]   it releases us from the anxieties of what we think is ahead
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.240]   'cause what ahead is good.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.560]   So Lord, I pray for anyone
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.480]   who's struggling with their future,
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.960]   that the glory that is found in the living hope today
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.920]   would restore them.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.720]   And Lord, for us in this moment,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.080]   for us in the now that we're a part of,
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.840]   Father, would your Holy Spirit come?
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:23.120]   Would the God of hope bring joy and peace to this moment?
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:29.160]   And perhaps if you're receiving this word today
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.520]   as our eyes are closed, you just wanna open your hands.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.640]   It's just a simple way of just symbolizing before the Lord
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.000]   that you wanna respond now
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.480]   to the ministry of the Spirit of God upon you.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.960]   And I believe for some of you now in this moment,
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.320]   maybe it's been a while since you felt joy and peace.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:54.520]   It's been a while since you felt true hope.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:48:00.600]   I wanna pray that the God of hope
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.520]   would pour out joy and peace
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.760]   and cause you to overflow with hope
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.640]   through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.280]   So Holy Spirit, would you come?
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.200]   And would you come and minister in this way right now?
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.880]   Lord, for those people whose hands are open before you here,
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.120]   would your Holy Spirit begin the joy and the peace
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.000]   and the renewed life that is found in the grace
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.640]   and the glory of Christ Jesus
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.200]   and the living hope that is made true now?
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:38.160]   I pray that you just receive the ministry of the Spirit.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.400]   Our choir are gonna now respond and sing over us,
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.440]   but I wanna encourage you just to keep your eyes closed,
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.080]   resist the urge to film it on your camera,
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:52.240]   resist the urge to move from this moment.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.640]   This is a very important moment for most of you right now.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:00.280]   So as your eyes are closed, as your hands are open,
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.440]   allow the lyrics of this song and the ministry of the choir
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:09.960]   to facilitate what the Holy Spirit is doing in you.
