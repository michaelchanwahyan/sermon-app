1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 our hearts be in tune with your spirit.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 In Jesus' name, amen.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,800
 - Amen, thank you, Carla.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,420
 Good morning, everybody.

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,160
 How are you guys doing?

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,480
 Good, well, we are starting a brand new series

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,520
 and I wanna kick this off by telling you a story

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,200
 of, I think, when was it?

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,960
 July 3rd, 2018.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,000
 I had this experience, this really big,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 life-changing, life-altering, hit-me-at-my-core

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,020
 kind of experience, an experience, an encounter, actually,

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,200
 that has stayed with me every day,

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,660
 literally every day since.

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,440
 It has shaped who I am in so many ways.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,560
 It has given me things to think about.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,420
 It was unexpected, things didn't go according to plan,

18
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,360
 but it stuck with me.

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,520
 I wanna share with you about the time I had dinner

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,740
 with Pastor Jethro.

21
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,200
 Who's sitting over there?

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,440
 So let me tell you about Jethro.

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,040
 Back in 2018, I was new to the Vine.

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,160
 I had been here for a few months, maybe,

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,640
 and I was a worship pastor, and I was learning the ropes

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,160
 and trying to get to know everyone here.

27
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,040
 So Jethro was a core team member.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,600
 He was the best keyboard player on the team,

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,000
 and I'm like, "I'm gonna get to know Jethro.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,320
 "I'm gonna learn some things about this team."

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,960
 So I asked him to dinner, and we're texting back and forth,

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,180
 like us young people do, and I'm like,

33
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,880
 "Yo, Jeth, let's have dinner."

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,080
 He's like, "All right, cool.

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,720
 "Where do you wanna go?"

36
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,200
 So this is my version of the story.

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,480
 You can fact-check me later if Jethro says otherwise,

38
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,200
 but what happened was I texted him.

39
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,320
 I'm like, "LCK, okay?"

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,720
 Now, if you spend all your time on Hong Kong Island,

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,000
 you don't know what LCK is, but if you ever go to Kowloon,

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,360
 LCK stands for Lai Chi Kok, right?

43
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,400
 That's where I used to live.

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,240
 That was my hood.

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,640
 All the CIS teachers are clapping

46
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,640
 'cause that's their hood as well.

47
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,400
 So I say, "LCK, okay?"

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,600
 And that was the last of kind of

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,480
 what I thought the conversation was.

50
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,040
 I don't know, about 30, 45 minutes, an hour later,

51
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,760
 I get a message from Jethro and it says,

52
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,120
 "I'm in Wan Chai."

53
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,400
 I'm like, "What's wrong with Jethro?"

54
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,240
 I'm just getting to know him.

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,640
 I'm like, "What's his issue?"

56
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
 So I look at my phone and I'm like,

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,560
 "Why are you in Wan Chai?"

58
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,380
 He goes, "Dinner, dot, dot, dot, question mark,"

59
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,160
 with a little creepy eye emoji.

60
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,520
 So then I go back and I'm like,

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,180
 "Why is he thinking we're supposed to be in?"

62
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,100
 So I go back to my messages.

63
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,800
 I'm about to call him out and be like,

64
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,760
 "Buddy, learn how to read."

65
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,640
 So I'm scrolling through and I'm like,

66
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,800
 "Oh no."

67
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,520
 I realized that I had been a victim of autocorrect.

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,600
 See, I had typed L-C-K, okay, right?

69
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,740
 So L-C-K, okay.

70
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,280
 What came out was, "Pick," P-I-C-K.

71
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,200
 So Jethro did that.

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,040
 He picked.

73
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,520
 And he picked Wan Chai.

74
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,440
 And I was in, and apparently I actually agreed to this.

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,600
 So he went back and read the messages

76
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,560
 and apparently I'm not thinking when I'm responding.

77
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,440
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure, whatever."

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,160
 So I'd actually agreed to the thumbs up

79
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,320
 to coming to Wan Chai.

80
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,040
 And I'm standing in Lychee Cog, MTR, waiting for Jethro.

81
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
 He's in Wan Chai waiting for me.

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
 And Jethro being the saint that he is,

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,360
 leaves Wan Chai and goes all the way to Lychee Cog.

84
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
 Let me explain.

85
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,400
 He was in Science Park up in Taipo,

86
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,240
 came all the way down to,

87
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
 yes, feel bad for him.

88
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,040
 I'm a terrible friend.

89
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,280
 That's the moral of the story.

90
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,360
 But regardless, this has never left me

91
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,340
 because Jethro to this day still judges me for my typos,

92
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,440
 regularly coming at me about the typos that I have,

93
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,440
 whether it's in the WhatsApp message or in like an email,

94
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,160
 anything, he's always looking at my typos.

95
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,160
 It's the one thing he focuses on.

96
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,120
 To the point where my birthday was this past Thursday.

97
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,600
 I turned 34 and I'm excited

98
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,680
 and I get my first happy birthday

99
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,240
 and it's from my friend Jethro, which is great.

100
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,640
 But then online, so that everyone can see it,

101
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,600
 he posts this beautiful post.

102
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,360
 Thanks for coming into my life and staying into my life.

103
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,940
 But in that same post, he's like,

104
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,860
 "I love you, typos and all."

105
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,060
 The shade, y'all.

106
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,440
 Like he just has not left me alone.

107
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,640
 This was not just an experience.

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,040
 It was an encounter with Jethro and with proofreading

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
 and with autocorrect.

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
 And let me just say, I have learned my lesson,

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,600
 or I try at least,

112
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,340
 I think I still have some typos here and there.

113
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,360
 But it stayed with me.

114
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,880
 I share this because it was more than an experience.

115
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,720
 It was an encounter.

116
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,680
 It's something that has actually shaped me.

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,980
 I really do think about what I text and I do go back

118
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,620
 and if I'm meeting someone somewhere,

119
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,480
 I double check where it's at, right?

120
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,720
 It has stayed with me, it has shaped me in a certain way.

121
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,920
 And encounters do this to us all.

122
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,480
 When we have a big, meaningful encounter, it shapes us.

123
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,420
 It redirects us.

124
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,280
 It changes our perspective to some extent.

125
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,980
 And when we have encounters with God,

126
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,040
 well, that changes us even more.

127
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,160
 It seems like the impacts that come from an encounter

128
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,800
 with God somehow are more magnified.

129
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,360
 They are multiplied to a higher degree.

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,720
 When we have an encounter with God,

131
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,040
 it shapes our intimacy with him.

132
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,560
 It helps us to get to know him better.

133
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
 When we have an encounter with God,

134
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,200
 we get shaped and molded more into his likeness.

135
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,680
 We become more like him when we encounter him.

136
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,160
 These encounters help us see God more clearly.

137
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,960
 These encounters help us shake lies

138
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,240
 that we once believed about ourselves.

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,720
 It helps us shake delusions and stand on truth.

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,080
 Encounters with God is important.

141
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,480
 It's very important 'cause the effects of an encounter

142
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,760
 with God can last with us for the rest of our lives.

143
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,800
 The effects of our encounters with God show us

144
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,840
 that we don't have to solely rely on ourselves to get by.

145
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,520
 It's not just us looking out for us.

146
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,860
 In an encounter with God, God encounters us

147
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,740
 to show us that we are not alone in this and all that we do.

148
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,960
 So with this in mind,

149
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,720
 we've designed this five-week sermon series

150
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,720
 to look at five very familiar passages in the Old Testament,

151
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,720
 some key biblical figures that you might have heard of,

152
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,120
 might have read before,

153
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,680
 and their encounters,

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,960
 hoping that as we look and see the moments

155
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,700
 where God showed up,

156
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,280
 it would encourage us to allow God to show up

157
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,400
 in unexpected ways at unexpected times in our lives

158
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,100
 'cause it seems like when we allow those things to happen,

159
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,380
 we get changed at our core.

160
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,380
 I pray that it allows you to posture yourself

161
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,320
 as we study these encounters

162
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,580
 to become open to a holy disruption

163
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,920
 that will shake who you are to the core of who you are.

164
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,040
 Does that sound okay?

165
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,840
 So that's where we're gonna be going.

166
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,360
 So let me just bring this up to us

167
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,920
 and kind of give us a good working definition

168
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
 of an encounter.

169
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,480
 Encounters with God are these impactful moments,

170
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,640
 oftentimes unexpected, unprepared for, unanticipated,

171
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,600
 yet they end up changing us,

172
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,400
 helping us see God more truly for who he is

173
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,560
 and who we are, giving us strength,

174
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,560
 giving us confidence and resolve.

175
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,160
 This is what an encounter of God can do.

176
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,520
 But it's good to know that encounters

177
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,920
 don't all look the same.

178
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,360
 They don't all happen the same way.

179
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,120
 Encounters aren't just limited to certain kinds of people.

180
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,580
 I think by nature we might think an encounter with God

181
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,760
 must mean that we are living rightfully

182
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
 and we are the most holy of people.

183
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,040
 But encounters of God we'll see range from men to women

184
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,120
 to priests to sinners to liars to anybody.

185
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,240
 So many people can encounter God.

186
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,680
 And I say that because I want you to know

187
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,600
 that you don't have to have all your stuff together

188
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,160
 to have an encounter with God.

189
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
 You don't have to be a certain level of Christian

190
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
 to encounter God.

191
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
 Like I said, encounters don't all take place

192
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,000
 in the same way.

193
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,160
 Some encounters take place in a cave.

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
 Some encounters take place on mountaintops.

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,100
 Some encounters take place in the flames

196
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,360
 of Nebuchadnezzar's furnace.

197
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,320
 Some encounters take place in the temple.

198
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,920
 Some encounters take place in the room.

199
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,920
 Some encounters take place at the Ford of Jabbok.

200
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,760
 Crossing over and exist with the wrestling of God.

201
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,440
 So today our first encounter we're gonna look at

202
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,480
 is a man who is a liar, who's a thief,

203
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,960
 who swindles, who doesn't have it all right,

204
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,160
 who cheats to get ahead.

205
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,880
 We're gonna look at the man called Jacob today.

206
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,240
 Jacob's, well, there's a Jacob here.

207
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,120
 I'm sorry, bro.

208
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,960
 Jacob has a wild story.

209
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,080
 He's a twin.

210
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,700
 He's a younger brother, right?

211
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,660
 And God would tell his mother that the youngest son

212
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,680
 would lead the oldest.

213
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,440
 I think the verbatim is the oldest will bow down

214
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,260
 and submit to the younger one.

215
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,520
 This was Jacob's prophecy.

216
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,600
 This was counter-cultural.

217
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,560
 This wasn't normal.

218
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,240
 Normally the inheritance and the blessing

219
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,760
 goes to the oldest son, but Jacob as a twin

220
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,120
 ends up being the second son, and there's a promise

221
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,080
 that he would be the one to carry it forward.

222
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,580
 And it's important that we understand Jacob's name

223
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,480
 'cause names mean something.

224
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,120
 Names are not just, you know, what's popular,

225
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,040
 top 100 girl names or guy names this year.

226
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,800
 Names were super significant.

227
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,680
 You named someone something because you wanted

228
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,120
 to see something in them or in a response to a promise

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,700
 or because God had done something.

230
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,400
 So your name was a sense of your identity.

231
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,080
 A name was a sense of foreshadowing or reputation.

232
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,320
 And Jacob's name would mean the supplanter

233
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,360
 or the heel grabber because, silly enough,

234
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,600
 when he came out of the womb,

235
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,280
 he was holding on to his brother's heel.

236
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,400
 So his parents saw that and they're like,

237
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,840
 "Oh, this guy's ambitious.

238
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
 "We're gonna call him Jacob."

239
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,760
 And that would be his name.

240
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,600
 In Genesis 26, God would tell Rebecca

241
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,520
 that the children wrestle and struggle inside of you.

242
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,600
 Jacob would earn the full aspect of his name later on,

243
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
 which I think some of us who are familiar

244
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,500
 would think Jacob means deceiver.

245
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,680
 So for those of us familiar with the story,

246
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,680
 Jacob tricks his older brother Esau.

247
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,360
 He deceives him into selling his birthright for some stew,

248
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,760
 for some stew.

249
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
 I mean, talk about a low bar.

250
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,840
 So his brother sells his birthright.

251
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
 Jacob ends up taking it.

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,360
 Jacob ends up lying in the inheritance swap

253
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,440
 and he takes what was, I guess, meant for his brother.

254
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,200
 And Esau would say this in his complaint.

255
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,100
 "Is he not rightly named Jacob?

256
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,180
 "For he has cheated me these two times.

257
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,600
 "He took away my birthright and behold,

258
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,840
 "he has taken away my blessing."

259
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,320
 Jacob is a deceiver.

260
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,080
 He's the one who steals to get ahead.

261
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,200
 He's the one who cheats to get to first place.

262
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,840
 He supplants or trips up his brother.

263
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,760
 He wrestles him in the womb, wrestles him in birth,

264
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,960
 and wrestles him in their relationship.

265
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,080
 But don't worry, it gets better.

266
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,960
 Jacob is holistic in his wrestling.

267
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,000
 He doesn't just leave it to his brother.

268
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,240
 He continues wrestling in other aspects of his life.

269
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,700
 His brother wants to kill him

270
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,160
 because he has taken what belonged to him.

271
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,520
 So Jacob runs and flees and he meets this woman

272
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,680
 named Rachel, beautiful woman, I guess,

273
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,320
 because he's willing to enter into a contract

274
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,540
 to work seven years so that he can marry her.

275
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,200
 The story goes he works seven years

276
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,520
 and he thinks he's gonna get Rachel.

277
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,200
 On the wedding day, he actually doesn't get Rachel.

278
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,560
 The dad tricked him.

279
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,840
 The dad deceived him.

280
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,200
 The dad wrestled with him.

281
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,480
 And actually he gives him the other daughter, Leah.

282
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,680
 And Jacob's annoyed because, Bible says this,

283
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,980
 Rachel was the beautiful one, Leah was not so much.

284
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,800
 So he couldn't get Rachel because he had just gotten Leah.

285
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
 So the father's like, well, if you want Rachel,

286
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,920
 I'm not gonna give you both of my daughters for one price.

287
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
 You have to work another seven more years.

288
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,680
 So Jacob's been working for 14 years

289
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,940
 just to get the thing he thought he deserved.

290
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,840
 Wrestling.

291
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,680
 And it continues.

292
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 His land and his property, his sheep and his cattle end up,

293
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
 him and Laban live in the same area.

294
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,260
 They've decided to separate into two parts of the space

295
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,100
 so that there would be no mixing

296
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,800
 and all of Laban's things would be Laban's,

297
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,480
 all of Jacob's things would be Jacob's.

298
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,340
 But all of Jacob's cattle are bigger and stronger

299
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,060
 and look better and look healthier than Laban's,

300
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,680
 which creates conflict between him and his father-in-law.

301
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,520
 Wrestling.

302
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
 This theme of wrestling just continues

303
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,380
 and continues for Jacob.

304
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,500
 He wrestles with Esau.

305
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,460
 He wrestles with Laban.

306
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,340
 He uses strategy to try and figure out

307
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,580
 how do I get myself out of these situations?

308
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,260
 How do I get what I deserve?

309
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,180
 He fights, he wrestles.

310
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,260
 This is just his life at this point.

311
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,460
 But it would appear that God wanted more

312
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,660
 from him and of him.

313
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,340
 And so when we take a look here at Genesis 32

314
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,820
 where we have that famous encounter,

315
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,300
 starting at verse 22 it says this.

316
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,340
 The same night he, speaking of Jacob, arose,

317
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,460
 took his two wives, his two female servants,

318
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,940
 and his 11 children, crossed the ford at Jabbok.

319
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,300
 He took them and sent them across the stream

320
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
 and everything else that he had.

321
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,280
 And Jacob was left alone.

322
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,940
 And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.

323
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,340
 When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob,

324
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,740
 he touched his hip socket and Jacob's hip

325
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,740
 was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.

326
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,100
 Then he said, "Let me go, for the day is broken."

327
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
 But Jacob said, "I will not let you go

328
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,980
 "unless you bless me."

329
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,180
 And he said, "What is your name?"

330
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,220
 He said, "Jacob."

331
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,720
 Then he said, "You shall no longer be called Jacob,

332
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,340
 "but Israel, for you have striven with God

333
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,800
 "and with men and have prevailed."

334
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,220
 Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."

335
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,780
 But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?"

336
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,020
 And there he blessed him.

337
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,740
 So Jacob called the name of this place Peniel,

338
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,100
 saying, "I have seen God face to face,

339
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,180
 "and yet my life has been delivered."

340
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,980
 What has happened in this moment?

341
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,060
 Just a little bit of more context

342
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,120
 so that we really get this wrestle,

343
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,940
 because this is a massive encounter with God.

344
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,100
 This is an orthodox encounter with God,

345
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,300
 and we have to understand.

346
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,080
 So Jacob is getting ready to go back home.

347
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,900
 He's been away from home for all these years,

348
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,980
 and he's carrying his family and all the things he has,

349
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,540
 and he gets word that his brother,

350
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,700
 who hated him, who wanted to kill him, was ahead of him.

351
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,460
 So naturally, that scares him.

352
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,500
 Then the word gets worse.

353
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,500
 His brother is with 400 men ahead of him.

354
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,940
 Naturally, Jacob gets a little nervous,

355
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,300
 slows down a little bit, and thinks,

356
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,180
 okay, well, what do I do?

357
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,380
 I have a wife, I have two wives, I have kids,

358
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,220
 I have 11 children, I have all this stuff.

359
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,540
 How are we gonna make it if my brother

360
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,380
 wants revenge for what I've done?

361
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,420
 He is in a desperate, broken moment.

362
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,620
 So he gets clever.

363
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,380
 He sends some of his best stuff ahead.

364
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,900
 He goes, take this to Esau.

365
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,580
 When you see Esau say, these are gifts from Jacob.

366
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,320
 So he tries to use a little bit of cleverness, strategy,

367
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,260
 maybe not trickery, but a little bit of deceit.

368
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,420
 He doesn't really wanna give him gifts,

369
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,340
 he just doesn't wanna get killed, right?

370
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,160
 Makes sense.

371
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,100
 He's doing the best that he can.

372
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,220
 He's doing what he thinks he needs to do,

373
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,040
 but he's worried.

374
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,460
 He's at his lowest point here.

375
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,140
 He has all this stuff, yet he still is at this moment of,

376
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,180
 what do I do?

377
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,180
 In tension, in brokenness, the unexpected then happens.

378
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,580
 He's unprepared, and unexpectedly,

379
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,740
 he has this encounter with God in the form of a fight.

380
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,820
 I'm just gonna be honest.

381
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,780
 When I encounter God, I hope he's not trying to fight me.

382
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,680
 That must have been a moment.

383
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,200
 But how poetically beautiful is it

384
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,300
 that most of Jacob's life has been marked symbolically

385
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,980
 with this aspect of wrestling.

386
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,940
 And when he encounters God,

387
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,220
 his encounter with him is through what?

388
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,380
 Through a wrestle, through a struggle.

389
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,380
 God meets him in a language that he is overly familiar with.

390
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,580
 And the first thing we have to note here

391
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,060
 is how God meets him on these challenging terms.

392
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,020
 The context of his situation were not ideal.

393
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,820
 God meets him here in his mess, in his brokenness.

394
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,540
 When we need him the most, that's when God meets us.

395
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,660
 And I think it's something that we have to keep in mind

396
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,580
 because a lot of us subconsciously live in a way

397
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,580
 that seeks out pleasure and avoids pain.

398
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,540
 But what if it's in the pain

399
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,380
 that God plans to speak the loudest?

400
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,020
 What if it's in the pain

401
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,300
 that God plans on encountering you?

402
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,400
 If our life is constantly avoiding the difficult,

403
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,700
 do we potentially avoid these encounters with God?

404
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,660
 So if you're struggling,

405
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,860
 if you're in a place of brokenness,

406
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,620
 if your life is going less than expected,

407
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,220
 if you've run into unexpected conflict and trouble

408
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,020
 and things just don't seem right,

409
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,640
 if you're in your darkest place,

410
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,980
 if you're in a moment of tension and pain,

411
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,580
 if your circumstances leave you desperate,

412
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,420
 that's an open door for an encounter.

413
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,680
 That's what we see here in Jacob.

414
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,300
 God has a funny way of showing up most clear

415
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,820
 in our darkest hours.

416
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,140
 And so I wonder what would happen

417
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,460
 if in those moments of darkness,

418
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,340
 we sought him instead of running away.

419
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:58,260
 It leads me to the second thing that I noticed in this story

420
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,820
 and that's around prayer,

421
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,540
 how prayer is essential to an encounter with God.

422
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,060
 So that's exactly what Jacob does.

423
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,780
 In verse nine, he prays.

424
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,020
 It's gonna come up on here.

425
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,620
 I'm just gonna read a couple of points from his prayer.

426
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,500
 He prays to God.

427
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,180
 He says, "You told me to return to my country

428
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,500
 "that you would do good.

429
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,560
 "I'm not worthy of the least of the deeds

430
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,380
 "of your steadfast love and all your faithfulness

431
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,020
 "that you've shown me.

432
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,160
 "For even though when I crossed,

433
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,720
 "when I only had my staff, I crossed the Jordan,

434
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,460
 "and now I have become two camps.

435
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,420
 "Please deliver me from the hand of my brother,

436
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,180
 "from the hand of Esau," listen to this,

437
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,060
 "for I fear him."

438
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,740
 I love that Jacob, when he prays in this moment,

439
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
 before he does anything,

440
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,220
 he doesn't have the best words.

441
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,380
 This isn't like super sophisticated big man prayer, right?

442
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,180
 He's not using anything fancy.

443
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,460
 He's just positioning himself authentically

444
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,780
 in front of God.

445
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,500
 He doesn't have to have a seminary degree.

446
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,300
 He doesn't have to have been in church for all his life.

447
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,240
 He's just exposing his heart to God.

448
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,900
 We can do this, right?

449
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,480
 We can just share where we are with God.

450
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,540
 I mean, what would happen if we did this?

451
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,300
 If there's something that's found

452
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,060
 when we turn our dependence on God into a prayer to God?

453
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,220
 What if that's what prayer really is about,

454
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,740
 being honest with him and being honest with yourself,

455
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,540
 that perhaps you've not been worthy,

456
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,860
 but actually God's been good.

457
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,940
 God has done things.

458
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,740
 It's fascinating.

459
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,020
 Jacob is at this point where he might get killed

460
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,300
 and everything he has might be destroyed,

461
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,380
 and he recounts the blessings of God.

462
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,360
 He goes, "When I first got here, God,

463
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,400
 "I just had my staff.

464
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,240
 "I had nothing."

465
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,340
 It's the same concept of,

466
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,340
 I just had the clothes on my back and that's it.

467
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,500
 But now I'm here with two camps.

468
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,300
 He's speaking of the wealth that he's accumulated,

469
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,840
 of family, children.

470
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,160
 He has been blessed.

471
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,740
 And he's thanking God, first and foremost,

472
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,800
 I don't know how it's happened.

473
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,380
 I don't even think I deserve it.

474
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,520
 I've been unworthy of this, but you have been good.

475
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,060
 He recalls the faithfulness of God.

476
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,140
 His desperation does not blind him

477
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,440
 from the reality that God has been there

478
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,940
 and God has been blessing him.

479
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,200
 And then his prayer changes a bit.

480
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,980
 He pours out his heart to God.

481
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,240
 My favorite thing that I learned in this entire passage

482
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,780
 when I was studying it was just,

483
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,280
 I didn't even learn it, I just read it and it hit me hard.

484
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,940
 He says, "I fear him.

485
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,300
 "I fear Esau."

486
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,840
 That is as clear, that is as honest,

487
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,920
 probably as vulnerable as it gets.

488
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
 He's raw.

489
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,980
 He's not trying to come up with anything strategic.

490
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,340
 He's not trying to over-spiritualize

491
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,840
 or say it's this or say it's that

492
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,320
 or use some big fancy words.

493
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,000
 He is just being bare in front of God.

494
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,380
 That level of authenticity,

495
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,800
 that level of purely exposing where your heart is,

496
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,700
 no pretentiousness, no big words,

497
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,360
 just showing God your heart.

498
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,020
 What if that's an element to prayer?

499
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,680
 What if that's a powerful part of prayer?

500
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,660
 What if that's the gateway?

501
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,420
 What if that's what kickstarts things in our life?

502
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,100
 Just truly coming before him and being properly honest

503
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,280
 about what it is we feel, about where it is we are.

504
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,520
 See, Jacob, he prays,

505
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,120
 but he doesn't have his big encounter when he prays.

506
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,920
 Think about that.

507
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,900
 He says his prayer and no big moment happens.

508
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,360
 No, the big, the encounter comes

509
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,000
 because he opens himself up.

510
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,400
 He prays, nothing happens.

511
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,600
 In the moment of praying,

512
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,800
 there's no big miracle or anything,

513
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,180
 but praying seemed to open the door.

514
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:55,040
 Prayer, therefore, is essential to an encounter with God.

515
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,200
 See, after his prayer, I love this as well.

516
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,540
 The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things.

517
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,720
 Genesis is for us broken people.

518
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,800
 Jacob has this prayer.

519
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,100
 He's thanked God.

520
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,680
 He's been honest with God,

521
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,960
 and I think for lots of us,

522
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,720
 we think that if we just do it like that,

523
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,120
 then we'll become a better Christian right away.

524
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,160
 Let's look at this one more time.

525
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,360
 He does all these things.

526
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,040
 He does all the right things in his prayer,

527
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,640
 and then he goes back to strategizing.

528
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,160
 He goes back to leaning on his own strength.

529
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,720
 He goes back to being human.

530
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,320
 Like, he didn't all of a sudden become not human

531
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
 all of a sudden 'cause he prayed.

532
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,240
 I think some of us get discouraged 'cause we pray

533
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,200
 and we expect everything to change.

534
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,800
 We just all of a sudden are floating on clouds

535
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,960
 and we're more holy.

536
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
 We no longer deal with temptation anymore.

537
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,660
 That's actually not how it works.

538
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,440
 We've got to have the right picture of prayer.

539
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,800
 Sometimes you're gonna pray

540
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,400
 and you're still gonna struggle.

541
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,080
 That's the reality of our life,

542
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,880
 and I'm so glad that's clear in here.

543
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,680
 He leans back on his human tendency

544
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,040
 to control his next steps,

545
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,000
 but he's opened up a door.

546
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,840
 By praying, he's started something.

547
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,440
 He's allowed something to happen,

548
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,280
 and then it does.

549
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,120
 It happens.

550
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,360
 He prayed in the beginning of the night.

551
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,800
 Later in the night, he has his encounter with God,

552
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,720
 and his encounter comes with a wrestle,

553
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,840
 which I think is weird.

554
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,800
 Like, of all the crazy things God can do

555
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,720
 when he encounters you,

556
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,160
 like, I guess for me, sign me up.

557
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,480
 I don't wanna wrestle God.

558
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,000
 I would much rather just have him talk to me

559
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,380
 and tell me who I am, all these things,

560
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,240
 but Jacob ends up wrestling him,

561
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,200
 and I'm pretty convinced Jacob had no idea

562
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,380
 it was God at first.

563
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,500
 It's the dark of night.

564
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,620
 He probably thinks maybe Esau sent somebody

565
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,200
 knowing I was coming to take me out.

566
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,960
 Maybe there's thieves and robbers around

567
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,060
 trying to take my stuff.

568
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,400
 I mean, I'm carrying all this stuff.

569
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,680
 I'm a well-off guy.

570
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,280
 He wrestles this guy, probably in self-defense,

571
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,800
 but at some point, something clicks in his head.

572
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,880
 This isn't human.

573
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,040
 I'm wrestling divinity.

574
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,400
 I am pushing against the creator of the universe.

575
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,120
 He becomes aware that he's wrestling with God,

576
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
 and what does he do?

577
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,180
 He doesn't let go.

578
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,400
 He holds on.

579
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,520
 He digs his heels, and he wholly commits himself

580
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,400
 to the fight.

581
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,240
 He holds on more.

582
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,340
 He struggles, he fights, he even gets his hip displaced.

583
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,400
 Fun fact, don't fight God, he'll break your hip.

584
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,640
 That's my takeaway today.

585
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,320
 But even in that space, it seems like that's when

586
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,120
 the change actually starts to begin.

587
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,840
 See, the old Jacob, his strategy, his way,

588
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,960
 his preference in doing things was through deception.

589
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,160
 The old Jacob would have tried to,

590
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,560
 when he realized this was God,

591
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,480
 he would have tried to deceive him.

592
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,040
 He would have tried to supplant.

593
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,320
 He would have tried to trick or try to get ahead

594
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,560
 or get something out of him.

595
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,840
 He would have tried to get his own way,

596
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,560
 but instead, he wrestles him,

597
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,520
 which means he just holds on to him.

598
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,840
 Like, it doesn't say that he beats up God, right,

599
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,760
 or God beats him up.

600
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,720
 He fights with him.

601
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,400
 He's against, he's holding on with all that he has.

602
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,840
 It feels like it's in that moment, he's like,

603
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,560
 "God, if this is you, I have you.

604
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,440
 "I have your attention, you have mine,

605
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,500
 "and I'm not gonna let you go."

606
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,940
 That is his wrestle.

607
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,700
 It's a clinging on to God.

608
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,140
 With his one chance, he stays, he wrestles,

609
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,140
 he's got everything to lose, but Jacob clings to God.

610
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,100
 A clear indicator of his transformation

611
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,100
 in the middle of all of this is that Jacob then asks,

612
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,700
 what do I mean by this?

613
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,980
 Well, so far, Jacob has been really good at taking, right?

614
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,540
 He's been really good at being clever,

615
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,440
 and whatever he thought was his,

616
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,020
 he would reach for it, he would take it.

617
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,820
 Think specifically to the birthright situation.

618
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,700
 There was a whole prophecy around how he would be the one

619
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,820
 who would get the inheritance,

620
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,920
 but when things didn't go the way he thought,

621
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,180
 when it looked challenging,

622
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,120
 when it seemed like it was out of reach

623
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,500
 and God wasn't gonna do anything,

624
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,420
 he took it upon himself to get

625
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,020
 what he thought belonged to him.

626
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,480
 So that would be the natural way

627
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,700
 that Jacob would engage in this space, but he asks.

628
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,180
 He asks.

629
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,460
 I think this is a big thing for a lot of us,

630
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,340
 because a lot of us live lives

631
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,180
 where we've got to take to get what we need.

632
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,380
 No one's really looking out for us.

633
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,860
 If I don't look out for me, who's gonna look out for me?

634
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,860
 And so we strive and we push and we take

635
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,620
 and we reach and we grab.

636
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,540
 If there's an obstacle in front of me and what I need,

637
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,080
 I've got to figure out a way to get it.

638
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,020
 We reach for whatever is around us.

639
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,220
 This is the natural way that our city operates.

640
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,500
 And this is the reality.

641
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,820
 Getting the right things the wrong way

642
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,560
 will never actually satisfy you.

643
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,780
 I mean, think about it.

644
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,100
 Jacob already got the blessing.

645
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,940
 Isaac actually blessed him.

646
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,580
 Esau actually gave away his birthright.

647
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,980
 He's already received the blessing.

648
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,380
 What is he fighting for?

649
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,660
 He's received the blessing, but he's in a moment

650
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,480
 where he's terrified to go forward,

651
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,700
 where his whole world could be lost.

652
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,000
 He's received the blessing,

653
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,620
 but he's petrified to move forward.

654
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,860
 He has a wife and kids.

655
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,460
 He has all the material things.

656
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,340
 He's been blessed, but yet he's in the darkest,

657
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,980
 most tense moment of his life.

658
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,700
 He's taken rather than received.

659
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,540
 And this is actually something that we can trace back

660
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,920
 to the beginning of scripture in Genesis.

661
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,020
 We know that Adam and Eve, that the tree,

662
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,220
 the fruit on the tree looked desirable,

663
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,260
 looked good for eating.

664
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,380
 And when they are deceived, what do they do?

665
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,700
 Rather than going to the maker and asking him for it,

666
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,900
 they reach, they take for themselves.

667
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,300
 They become their own gods.

668
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,660
 And in doing that, they end up wrecking a relationship,

669
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,420
 absolutely breaking the relationship with them

670
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,320
 and God.

671
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,320
 So here's a crazy thought then.

672
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,780
 Maybe the real blessing isn't the things we receive,

673
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,500
 but maybe it's the relationship we open up

674
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,380
 with the one who gives the thing in the first place.

675
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,380
 What if that's the whole thing?

676
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,700
 What if the true blessing is that relationship

677
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,660
 with the one who created it all,

678
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,960
 with the giver of the gift, not just the gift?

679
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,860
 And I think what happens is when we reach,

680
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,940
 we bypass the giver and we get the stuff,

681
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,980
 or at least the best that we can reach for.

682
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,140
 And I wonder how many times in our life

683
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,580
 God is planning to intervene, to meet us where we are,

684
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,560
 to show up, to give us what we need,

685
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,940
 but we end up taking matters into our own hands.

686
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,020
 We end up filling our hands with the things

687
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,660
 that we can reach for, giving us absolutely no space

688
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,420
 to receive the thing he has for us.

689
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:54,740
 We end up filling ourselves with these lesser store brand

690
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,980
 blessings that really don't fulfill us in the first place.

691
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,460
 We end up becoming our own heroes, our own God.

692
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,140
 We settle for the beta version, not the true thing.

693
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,660
 And Jacob in this moment has had enough of what he can do.

694
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,980
 He's seen what his striving and what his reaching

695
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,040
 has done for him.

696
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,620
 And it's not enough.

697
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,140
 So he reaches this point and in this encounter,

698
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,780
 he asks for the blessing.

699
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,020
 Slight difference.

700
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,900
 He asks for the blessing versus taking the blessing.

701
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,940
 And that changes everything.

702
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,980
 I wonder what it would take for us

703
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,500
 to reach that point as well,

704
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,820
 where we recognize that actually,

705
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,980
 he says, "Knock, the door will be opened.

706
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,660
 "Ask and you will receive."

707
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,380
 The father withholds no good gift from his children.

708
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,380
 He actually says in scripture that if you wicked people

709
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,380
 can give your kids food and good gifts,

710
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,180
 how much more am I gonna give you things?

711
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,020
 Later in the New Testament,

712
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,220
 it says that every good and perfect thing

713
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,860
 comes from the father above.

714
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,660
 He is good and a giver of good stuff,

715
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,500
 but we're not gonna be able to see that.

716
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,180
 We're not gonna be able to receive that

717
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,940
 if we've taken for ourselves the best of what we can grab,

718
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,340
 the best of what we can do.

719
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,860
 This was Jacob.

720
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,620
 This was his dark moment, his lonely moment.

721
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,340
 His encounter was so unorthodox,

722
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,540
 yet his healing was in his wrestle.

723
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,180
 And like he should, like we should,

724
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:33,180
 he wrestles through the night till dawn and he prevails.

725
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,540
 And what does it mean for him to prevail?

726
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,660
 It means that the old him has gone

727
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,620
 and a new version of him has come.

728
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,260
 He is no longer Jacob the deceiver.

729
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,140
 He is now Jacob the requester.

730
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,340
 He's truly prevailed.

731
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,380
 He has asked and God has blessed him.

732
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,180
 This encounter has been successful.

733
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,020
 God has met with him and he gets blessed,

734
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,620
 but I think there's a couple of details

735
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,780
 we need to really sit on before we continue.

736
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,300
 His situation hasn't changed.

737
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,060
 Has anyone noticed that yet?

738
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,700
 He meets with God as this awesome encounter,

739
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,060
 wrestles God, sees him face to face,

740
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,060
 but he still has a brother that might wanna kill him

741
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,780
 with 400 men.

742
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,220
 And his encounter with God didn't come

743
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,220
 with 400 mercenary angels ready to fight on his behalf.

744
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,660
 It didn't come with extra strength to be able to fight.

745
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,020
 Actually, let's see, what does this encounter actually

746
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,420
 produce that says, "Your name shall no longer be called

747
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,000
 "Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God

748
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,540
 "and with men and you've prevailed."

749
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,660
 So in his asking of God, in his big encounter moment,

750
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,020
 he's finally done it all right.

751
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,100
 And what does he get?

752
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,380
 A limp and a new name.

753
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,260
 Take that to the battle.

754
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,460
 How does that even work?

755
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,340
 Think about this.

756
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,780
 It wasn't until Jethro pointed it out

757
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,260
 in our conversation about it.

758
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,180
 This is his point, not mine.

759
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,220
 Jacob is now more vulnerable because he met with God.

760
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,020
 He actually can't defend himself.

761
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,180
 See, sometimes we think if we just pray,

762
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,940
 we're gonna have all the strength to do everything

763
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,300
 and we're just gonna have these results happen overnight.

764
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,940
 What happens when you pray

765
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,220
 and somehow you're more vulnerable afterwards?

766
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,620
 Have you ever felt that way?

767
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,020
 Where you poured out your heart to God

768
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,220
 and your situation hasn't changed immediately?

769
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,580
 Maybe you've walked away with a spiritual limp.

770
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,760
 God gives him a limp and a new name.

771
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,060
 But here's the thing.

772
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,900
 The blessing from his encounter with God

773
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,000
 is gonna be for who Jacob is at the core.

774
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,500
 God blesses him by changing not just his name,

775
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,420
 but now his identity.

776
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,740
 If you remember what I said earlier in this sermon,

777
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,700
 the name is so important.

778
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,540
 The name speaks to who you are.

779
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,780
 It speaks to what you're gonna do.

780
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,260
 It speaks to what you have done.

781
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,480
 It is, in essence, your identity.

782
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,100
 The whole of you can be wrapped up in your name.

783
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,980
 And so now after experiencing and encountering God

784
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,300
 in this way, he's no longer Jacob the trickster,

785
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,620
 no longer Jacob the supplanter, the heel grabber,

786
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,660
 the one who tries to cheat to get ahead.

787
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,540
 He is now Israel, the one who fought and wrestled with God

788
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,340
 and has been changed and prevailed.

789
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,160
 God, in essence, has changed the entirety of who Jacob is.

790
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,960
 God renames him something from their encounter,

791
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,900
 but something for his future.

792
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,620
 Jacob is able to enter this same challenging

793
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,980
 and hard and tense and broken situation,

794
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,180
 all the same that it was,

795
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,700
 but as a completely different person

796
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,300
 with a completely new identity,

797
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,820
 having seen the face of God, put it this way,

798
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,100
 the situation didn't change, but the person did.

799
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,660
 The situation didn't change, but the person did.

800
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,820
 And this had to have an effect on his perspective.

801
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,020
 He had to look at his moment a bit differently now.

802
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,980
 He's walking with this limp yes, but with this swagger,

803
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,100
 'cause he's just seen God, he's just wrestled with God,

804
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,460
 he's just had the source of all good things with him.

805
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,500
 He has struggled with him.

806
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,580
 And all of a sudden, yes, Esau's still there with 400 men,

807
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,580
 but perhaps he's not longer gripped in fear of his brother.

808
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,540
 Perhaps there's a slight easing,

809
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,260
 a confidence that has come because you were with God,

810
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,140
 because you were in his presence,

811
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,660
 because you spent time with him,

812
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,580
 wrestling and contending him.

813
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,000
 Looking now at the situation completely different,

814
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,020
 Jacob can no longer lean on his own strength.

815
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,180
 He literally has to lean on God's ability.

816
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,260
 He literally has to lean on God's strength.

817
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,740
 And the story goes well,

818
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,860
 Jacob ends up going, seeing his brother,

819
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,820
 and his brother's happy to see him.

820
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,100
 That's great.

821
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,940
 That's awesome.

822
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,980
 That's a great, happy conclusion to our story.

823
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,340
 But before we got there,

824
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,380
 before we reached a happy conclusion,

825
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,060
 Jacob is changed and now has a new approach

826
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,980
 with no promises,

827
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,060
 simply based off of his encounter with God.

828
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,900
 This encounter exists to show us something

829
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,300
 of what an encounter of God can do in us and for us.

830
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,820
 How it can change us at our core.

831
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,500
 How it can bring about a divine confidence,

832
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,700
 reposition who we are,

833
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,060
 helping us learn how to lean on his strength

834
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,100
 in times of trouble.

835
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,540
 What we find,

836
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,700
 we find that we must be a people who do two things,

837
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,140
 who pray and a people who wait.

838
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,660
 I'm gonna boil everything down to those two things.

839
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,940
 The people who pray and the people who wait.

840
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,140
 These two things are essential.

841
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,940
 Jacob's encounter only comes after he prays.

842
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,460
 Prayer opened the door.

843
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,060
 I love that he prays early in the night,

844
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,460
 but the encounter doesn't come till later in the night.

845
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,140
 Prayer was his pregame.

846
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,980
 It was his way of opening the channel,

847
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,060
 posturing and positioning himself

848
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,940
 to be able to have that encounter,

849
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,180
 that unexpected meeting with God

850
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,620
 that produced unexpected results.

851
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,140
 Honest prayer is where you thank God, yes,

852
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,900
 but you also pour out your heart to God

853
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,740
 and you don't try to over-spiritualize it.

854
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,340
 You don't try to use the big words.

855
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,580
 You don't try to use Greek and Hebrew.

856
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,740
 You just tell him where you are.

857
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,740
 That kind of prayer is essential.

858
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,140
 This kind of prayer is what God wants for us,

859
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,940
 not from us, because in that it fuels,

860
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,420
 it gives depth to our intimacy with him.

861
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,500
 We spend time with him, we get to know him.

862
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,700
 And it requires that we trust that God hears us

863
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,940
 and that God will never leave us alone.

864
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,900
 It's not our battle to fight on our own.

865
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,100
 And the second thing, Jacob prays, nothing happens,

866
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,700
 but Jacob waits and something begins.

867
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,620
 This is probably the thing you gotta write down

868
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,900
 and keep for this week, all right?

869
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,380
 I think we've got to learn how to do this

870
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,180
 because we live in a society, in a generation,

871
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,580
 in a world of instant gratification.

872
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,460
 We don't have to wait for anything, right?

873
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,700
 Like everything is kind of quick.

874
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,340
 Everything, whatever we need, it's there.

875
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,100
 Life is like instant noodles, just really, really quick.

876
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,020
 Get what you need, get it really quick.

877
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,460
 And if we live this way in every aspect of our lives,

878
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,700
 we potentially take this way of thinking

879
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,020
 into our spiritual life.

880
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,740
 So when we go to God, when we actually dare

881
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,620
 to have the courage to pray and be honest,

882
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,580
 we don't have the discipline to wait for his response.

883
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,420
 We potentially don't have the discipline to wait

884
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,980
 for his rescue, for his encounter.

885
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:23,740
 Oftentimes that waiting is a wrestling through the feelings

886
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,620
 or wrestling through the silence

887
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,020
 or wrestling with your doubts

888
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,420
 or a wrestling through the whole night,

889
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,140
 as we see here in Jacob's story,

890
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,860
 to stay and to contend with God.

891
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,080
 Jacob's desperation is what fuels his wrestling.

892
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,540
 My question is, are we desperate enough

893
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,420
 to where if we get in that moment, we will not let him go?

894
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:52,860
 I think we've got this weird concept as a society,

895
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,860
 as a Christian society, that everything is formulaic.

896
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,620
 And what I mean by that is a lot of times

897
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,380
 we have these specific things that we do.

898
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,100
 You wake up and have a five-minute prayer

899
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,620
 and then you go about your day.

900
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,380
 Or every January, we do a 21-day fast.

901
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,580
 Nothing against fasting for 21 days, that's great.

902
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,420
 I do it too.

903
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,940
 But we have our 21-day fast and then we go on.

904
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,100
 But here's my question.

905
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,940
 What happens if it's not the formula?

906
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,700
 What happens if God is planning on meeting you

907
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,860
 on the 22nd day?

908
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:28,700
 What happens if God plans on meeting you

909
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,460
 minute six of your devotion?

910
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,060
 Sorry, God, only five minutes today.

911
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,700
 See, we've gotten this whole idea of quick, easy,

912
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,740
 and formula mixed together.

913
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,020
 And that's what's happening is that we put forth the effort,

914
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,380
 but we don't wait.

915
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,540
 We don't slow down enough to wait for him.

916
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,020
 So then we end up missing him.

917
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,940
 And not just missing him,

918
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,340
 we end up going and figuring it out ourselves.

919
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,020
 We end up, okay, well, God hasn't shown up,

920
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,580
 so let me figure out how I can do.

921
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,740
 Jacob does the same thing.

922
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,620
 God hasn't shown up, what can I do?

923
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,380
 I'll send these gifts, I'll send my kids ahead,

924
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,220
 I'll send this, doing all these things.

925
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,300
 We end up filling our hands with what we can grab

926
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,420
 with our strategies, with our own way of doing things,

927
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,700
 and we end up missing what it is that God has for us.

928
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,660
 What if we fasted for 22 days?

929
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,420
 What if, actually, I have time.

930
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,340
 Emma told me this when we were studying this passage.

931
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,660
 The 21-day fast, the Daniel fast,

932
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,340
 is something that we set up looking back on it.

933
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,540
 Daniel didn't set out saying,

934
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,900
 I'm only gonna fast for 21 days.

935
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,020
 Think about that.

936
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,340
 His fast was until something happens.

937
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,860
 So we look back on it, and we're like, all right, 21 days.

938
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,060
 But actually, this is not about the fast,

939
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,960
 this is about us in general.

940
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,540
 It's not the formula.

941
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,260
 You've got to wait.

942
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,180
 We've got to wait.

943
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,420
 We've got to wrestle and wait on the Lord.

944
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,380
 That's where we will renew our strength.

945
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,860
 That's where we will find our hope.

946
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,260
 That's when we'll rise on wings like eagles and soar,

947
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,060
 when we wait on the Lord.

948
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:02,940
 The temptation of not waiting on the Lord

949
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,980
 means that we enter into this headspace

950
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,040
 that we have to take care of ourselves.

951
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,980
 I was touched on it earlier,

952
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,180
 but it's something we have to remind ourselves.

953
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,800
 It's not just up to you to get you through.

954
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,380
 Hear this, you're not the only one that cares about you.

955
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,220
 It's good to know, right?

956
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,140
 There's someone who cares about you significantly more

957
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,740
 in every possible way, to the fullest extent,

958
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,820
 holistically cares about you.

959
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,020
 Our world and our lives are not solely dependent

960
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,540
 on what we can do and what we make of it.

961
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,400
 The Christian story is this,

962
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,620
 that we have abdicated the rights to be our own gods,

963
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,820
 and we've given that responsibility

964
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,600
 to the only true God in Jesus.

965
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,600
 And hear this, he cares for you.

966
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,820
 So could we live like that?

967
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,980
 Could we wait on him?

968
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,020
 Could we wait on God?

969
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,300
 Could we wait on the Lord through the night,

970
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,860
 through the tension, through the anxiety,

971
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,700
 through the stress?

972
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,340
 Could we wait on the Lord?

973
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,820
 Could we wait for those moments

974
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,180
 where we finally have his attention?

975
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,660
 When we have his attention, could we hold onto him?

976
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,620
 Could we grab him?

977
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,620
 Could we say, I'm not letting you go until you bless me?

978
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,100
 Could we posture ourselves to ask and not reach and grab?

979
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,580
 Could we hold on to him?

980
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,580
 Could we choose to not avoid or hide?

981
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,960
 Could we wrestle for more than just a feeling?

982
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,020
 Could we wrestle for all that he has for us?

983
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,060
 Can we put our future back in his hands

984
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,980
 where everything is possible,

985
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,900
 versus our hands where only so much can be achieved?

986
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,460
 Can we put it in the hands of him who has no limits?

987
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,620
 He operates in the impossible.

988
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,340
 That's the guy I want in the driver's seat of my life.

989
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,580
 So don't take for yourself what you find.

990
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,000
 Leave it to God to give you what he has.

991
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,100
 I grew up hearing this song,

992
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,940
 I think I was around maybe between the ages of seven and 10.

993
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,140
 My mom used to sing in the choir,

994
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,300
 which is where I get my ability to sing from.

995
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,820
 And I remember going to choir practices on Monday,

996
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,500
 and there's this one song they would sing.

997
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,540
 It was, ♪ You're an on-time God, yes he is ♪

998
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,540
 ♪ He's an on-time God, yes he is ♪

999
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,660
 And the words are, he may not come when you want him,

1000
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,740
 but he'll be there right on time.

1001
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,140
 He's an on-time God, yes he is.

1002
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,500
 Church, this is my appeal, that we've gotta wait.

1003
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,220
 It may feel like, God, you should have come five minutes ago,

1004
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,620
 you should have been here three weeks ago,

1005
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,020
 you should have been here before this challenge happens,

1006
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,380
 but he is an on-time God.

1007
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,900
 And he may not come when you think he should be there.

1008
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,820
 He may not do it the way that you want him to do it,

1009
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,460
 but that's the whole point of these encounters,

1010
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,460
 it's unexpected, it happens in unexpected ways,

1011
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,020
 but if we will position ourselves,

1012
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,140
 if we will posture ourselves to receive it

1013
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,020
 through praying and through waiting,

1014
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,040
 he does not disappoint.

1015
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,920
 He will not leave you alone.

1016
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,700
 He will not leave you to only your strength.

1017
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,780
 Wait on the Lord, wait through the night,

1018
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,760
 wait through the silence, hold on to him.

1019
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,260
 [congregation murmuring]

1020
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,760
 Waiting is hard.

1021
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,260
 Not gonna pretend like it's something you can theorize.

1022
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,960
 If it wasn't hard, we'd all do it.

1023
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,840
 But I pray that by understanding this encounter,

1024
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,840
 that it would produce something in you.

1025
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,960
 That your desperation to encounter, to know,

1026
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,020
 to experience that same God,

1027
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,020
 would fuel your discipline to wait.

1028
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,980
 I pray that the Holy Spirit

1029
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,420
 will give you the strength you need.

1030
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,300
 I pray that he will help and guide you,

1031
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,380
 that he will light your path and lead you forward,

1032
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,740
 that he will clear your mind,

1033
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,620
 that he will remind you of what is in front of you,

1034
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,660
 and that is a God who cares, a God who loves,

1035
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,380
 a God who desires the absolute best for you,

1036
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,980
 a God who loves you more than you can love yourself,

1037
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,700
 and a God who's more capable than what we're capable of.

1038
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,700
 And so Jesus, we come before you this morning asking,

1039
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:18,580
 asking, not reaching, but asking for your help.

1040
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,100
 God, would you teach us how to pray?

1041
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,860
 Would you teach us how to be honest in front of you?

1042
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,940
 How to bear our souls in front of you?

1043
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,660
 Would you give us the confidence and the trust to know

1044
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,900
 that you hear us when we pray,

1045
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,540
 and that you care about the dialogue,

1046
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,540
 about the channel of communication that it opens?

1047
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,100
 Would you remind us that by just being in your presence,

1048
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,940
 we are changed?

1049
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,740
 Would you remind us that by just being around you,

1050
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,380
 we are shaped and molded differently?

1051
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,140
 That these encounters are not limited to the holy

1052
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,980
 and to the saints, but it's also to the sinners like us.

1053
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,140
 Would you make us the people who pray?

1054
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,980
 And Holy Spirit, would you also be what sustains us?

1055
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,220
 Because starting can be easy, but staying can be hard.

1056
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,500
 So God, would you, through the power of the Holy Spirit,

1057
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,180
 sustain us in waiting for you, waiting on the Lord,

1058
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,180
 waiting and renewing our mind,

1059
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,900
 and that you would renew our strength,

1060
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,660
 that you would be what we need if we wait on you.

1061
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:30,100
 That we will find joy again if we wait on you.

1062
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,300
 That surely we will see you and your goodness

1063
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,180
 if we were to wait on you.

1064
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,940
 So Holy Spirit, sustain us,

1065
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,540
 give us the strength that we need to stay,

1066
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,100
 give us the discipline, the reminders that we need to stay,

1067
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,620
 to rely and to wait,

1068
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,220
 knowing that you're not gonna let us down.

1069
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:01,100
 You've never let us down before.

1070
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,780
 You've been faithful 100% of the time,

1071
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,620
 and so we lean on that faithful God this morning.

1072
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,140
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1073
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,260
 Amen.

1074
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:12,220
 (gentle music)

1075
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,800
 (gentle music)

1076
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,380
 (gentle music)
