1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
 - Amen. - Amen.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,040
 - Thank you.

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,200
 - Isn't he amazing?

4
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,080
 (audience applauding)

5
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,980
 Thank you, Leslie.

6
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,120
 How's everyone doing?

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,400
 Weather's finally changing.

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,920
 Are you enjoying it so far?

9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,080
 I love the weather this week.

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,400
 That I have to put on something extra to tell you

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,280
 I'm really enjoying it.

12
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,480
 So on Wednesday night, I remember after Alpha,

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,500
 I was leaving the building on my way to the bus stop

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,920
 and I was like, "Oh, that's awesome!"

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,560
 I missed it!

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,300
 To a point that when I reached the bus stop,

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,300
 I actually have to take out my phone,

18
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,660
 took a picture, put it on Instagram immediately,

19
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,240
 on stories and say, "I love the weather."

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,020
 I hope you're enjoying it because we don't get this a lot.

21
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,480
 Weather has been pretty hot, humid, terrible

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,360
 in the last couple of weeks, years, months, I don't know.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,640
 And I was actually Googling, not Googling,

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,800
 I first saw this on IG a couple days ago.

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,840
 It says that this mid-autumn, two weeks ago,

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,440
 it was the hottest mid-autumn ever

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,680
 in the history of Hong Kong.

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,960
 So I really, I saw it on the news, I didn't make this up.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,880
 Hong Kong sees hottest mid-autumn festival

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,440
 since records began in 1884.

31
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,100
 And I actually continued to do a little bit of digging

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,120
 and mainly I was searching Chinese news,

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,480
 which I don't have it here,

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,240
 but I'll show it to the Chinese congregation.

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,160
 I found out that last year, 2023,

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,160
 it was also a record-breaking hottest autumn last year.

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,280
 And then I continued to dig and realized in 2019,

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,760
 it was then also the record-breaking highest temperature,

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,240
 hottest autumn ever.

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,040
 So we had three record breakers in the last five years

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,920
 when it comes to how hot it's been.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,400
 Isn't it crazy?

43
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,360
 So I know, I know that, I know there's a debate out there

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
 whether global warming is fake news or not,

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,240
 I really know that.

46
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,760
 But like whenever I go out,

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,080
 whenever I sit in a house without turning on the air con,

48
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,120
 I know, like I'm so convinced that global warming,

49
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,240
 it's quite real.

50
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,800
 That heat is just unbearable.

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,680
 The thing about global warming is this,

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,360
 I grew up in a church here in Hong Kong.

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
 For 99% of the church meetings or services I've been to,

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,440
 whenever the topic global warming was brought up,

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,280
 99%, the implication was always the same.

56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,440
 Jesus is coming back, it's the end times, the end is near.

57
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,800
 Come on guys, repent and go and preach the gospel.

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,880
 I don't know about you,

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,320
 but I grew up in this part of the world

60
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,520
 and in this part of the world, in the church,

61
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,960
 99%, when we talk about global warming,

62
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,040
 we talk about the end times,

63
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,080
 we talk about Jesus coming back,

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,160
 so you should go out and preach the gospel.

65
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,160
 And yes, I do agree that there is an urgency of evangelism.

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,480
 But as you know, as much as we love evangelism

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
 here in this church,

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
 and by the way, Alpha on Tuesday and Wednesday,

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,120
 that's our expression of evangelism,

70
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,160
 and it's just the second week, or third week this week,

71
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,400
 so there is still time to bring friends.

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,640
 Okay, advertisement done.

73
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,860
 But as much as we love evangelism in this church,

74
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,060
 as we are wrapping up the Justice series,

75
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,820
 I do want to allow me to share from another perspective.

76
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,500
 You know, in the last couple of weeks,

77
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,520
 we actually explore four different spheres of relationship.

78
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,320
 We have that slide from Pastor Tim, I brought it back again.

79
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,540
 We talk about different, the four sphere of relationships,

80
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,540
 us with God, with ourselves, with others, and with creation.

81
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,820
 And we talked a little bit about the other three,

82
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,060
 God, ourselves, and others.

83
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,500
 And so today, we are gonna close the series

84
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,860
 with talking about our relationship with creation.

85
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,260
 And in the whole sermon series,

86
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,060
 we've been talking about how God

87
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,820
 originally designed these four relationships,

88
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,260
 or spheres of relationships,

89
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,500
 so that we could enjoy or experience shalom

90
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,980
 in these contexts.

91
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,420
 But tragically, humanity, we decided to rebel against God

92
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,260
 and sin against God, and consequently,

93
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,940
 we suffered from the disruption

94
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,720
 of all these four different relationships.

95
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,180
 Remember, Pastor Tim, he got like something,

96
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,820
 yeah, he drew on that, yeah.

97
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,540
 Oh, yes, yes.

98
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,380
 So you probably remember that.

99
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,420
 So we talked about this disruption of this relationship.

100
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,180
 And in previous week,

101
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,140
 we look at broken relationships with God,

102
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,400
 with ourselves, two weeks ago,

103
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,900
 I spoke a little bit about that.

104
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,920
 And last week, we talked about a relationship with others.

105
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,180
 And today, we will look at the final one.

106
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,940
 We will explore God's original intention

107
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,900
 for our relationship with the rest of his creation,

108
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,580
 what happened when humanity decided to rebel,

109
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,060
 and how would God fix this mess?

110
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,220
 And I believe today,

111
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,280
 we will also answer a very important question.

112
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,100
 What does being a follower of Christ have to do

113
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,960
 with all the efforts to protect and preserve the planet

114
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
 we now reside on?

115
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,220
 Why, like why do we care as Christians?

116
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,520
 And I could tell you from my experience,

117
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,080
 could we have the next slide, please?

118
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,060
 As a Christian spending like my entire life in Hong Kong,

119
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,840
 growing up in the church,

120
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,440
 every time when there is these like NGO coming to my school,

121
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,440
 giving a talk, or I see a TV program or advertisement,

122
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,840
 I never felt that was,

123
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,140
 or I know the urgency,

124
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,620
 but I never felt it has anything to do with my faith,

125
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,020
 with my identity as a Christian.

126
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,500
 But I believe today, we are going to dive deep into that.

127
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,500
 But just let me say that I'm not here to give you

128
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,900
 some educational information or presentation.

129
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,420
 I wanna open the word of God with you.

130
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,380
 And I can only do that in the power of the Holy Spirit

131
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,500
 and in his enlightenment.

132
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,700
 So how about we pray together first?

133
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,520
 Is that right?

134
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,240
 Father, we wanna know your heart.

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,580
 Perhaps this is one of the blind spot in your church,

136
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,020
 our relationship with the rest of your creation.

137
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,060
 So Father, we just pray that today,

138
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,860
 it's not just information,

139
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,840
 it's not just Bible knowledge.

140
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,780
 Father, we wanna know your heart.

141
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,860
 And I know as much as your heart burns for us,

142
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,580
 your heart burns for the rest of your creation.

143
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,640
 They are your craftsmanship as well.

144
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,340
 So God, we pray you would come

145
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,680
 and share your heart with us today.

146
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,020
 In Jesus name we pray.

147
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,320
 Amen.

148
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,960
 If you wanna know God's original plan for us

149
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,680
 and for the rest of creation,

150
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,880
 of course you have to go back to a book in the Bible.

151
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,400
 And that is Genesis.

152
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,520
 I hear that, yes.

153
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,160
 So we're going back to Genesis one.

154
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,180
 I'll be short 'cause I know you know a lot about that.

155
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,320
 Let's go to verse 20.

156
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,280
 I'll start with 28 maybe.

157
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,080
 God blessed them, Adam and Eve,

158
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,960
 and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number,

159
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,600
 fill the earth and subdue it.

160
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,080
 Rule over the fish in the sea and birds in the sky

161
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,520
 and over every living creature that moves on the ground."

162
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,760
 All right, Genesis one,

163
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,740
 it says we were to subdue and rule over God's creation.

164
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,060
 Do you feel very powerful right now?

165
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,880
 So we're the boss, right?

166
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,260
 We all rule over them.

167
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,280
 But does that mean we can do whatever we want?

168
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,860
 Let's look at one more verse in the next chapter.

169
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,160
 We're gonna look at chapter two, verse 15.

170
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,960
 Here it says, "The Lord God took the man, Adam,

171
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,820
 and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it

172
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,280
 and take care of it."

173
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,520
 And let's take a closer look at these two verbs here,

174
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,340
 to work and to take care.

175
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,000
 The Hebrew word for work here, it's avad.

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,640
 It means to serve with a sense of doing hard work

177
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,600
 in the process of serving.

178
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,000
 So God says, "I'm gonna put Adam, I'm gonna put you here.

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,200
 I'm gonna put humanity in my garden."

180
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,880
 And they are to serve it,

181
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,000
 serve it with diligence, with hard work.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,200
 And also they are to take care of it.

183
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
 And the Hebrew word here is shamar.

184
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,160
 Shamar literally means to guard and to preserve.

185
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,280
 So we are in charge of security, basically.

186
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,180
 Or we're in charge of growing it, developing it.

187
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,480
 So our job as humans or as image bearers of God,

188
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,600
 we were supposed to rule over creation,

189
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,560
 but it means in a way of serving, of caring,

190
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,900
 so that the whole creation would flourish under our care.

191
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,960
 That's the original plan.

192
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,600
 And if we look at the book of Psalms,

193
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,360
 we will see two interesting descriptions.

194
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,600
 Let's look at Psalms 24, verse one.

195
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,520
 It says here, "The earth is the Lord's

196
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,120
 and everything in it, the world and all who live in it."

197
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,200
 So here it says, "The earth is the Lord's,"

198
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,360
 and it speaks of God's ownership over the entire creation.

199
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,640
 But here in the next verse on the screen,

200
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,400
 Psalm 115, 16, it says this,

201
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,600
 "The highest heavens belong to the Lord,

202
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,600
 but the earth he has given to mankind," or human race.

203
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,360
 So the earth he has given to human race.

204
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,160
 These two statements are kind of like,

205
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,440
 if you first listen to it, you're like,

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
 are you sure, like, are they saying the same thing,

207
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,320
 or like, are they different?

208
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,360
 They're actually complementary to each other.

209
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,320
 They actually together give us a full picture.

210
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,280
 So while Psalm 24 speaks of the ownership

211
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,400
 of God in his creation,

212
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,200
 Psalm 115 actually talks about our stewardship

213
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,120
 because of his delegation.

214
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,580
 So God, at his creation, he has ownership,

215
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,620
 but on the other hand, because of his delegation to us,

216
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,980
 we have stewardship.

217
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,000
 So while God owns everything because he's the creator,

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,640
 he has chosen a partnership.

219
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,580
 He has chosen a partnership with you and me

220
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,120
 and with humanity as his representative

221
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,800
 to rule over the creation.

222
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,440
 We rule on his behalf.

223
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,680
 We are his stewards, or we're supposed to be,

224
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,940
 of course, right, until the fall.

225
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,940
 So two weeks ago, I talk about what happened

226
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,260
 in the Garden of Eden in Genesis chapter three,

227
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,940
 when Adam and Eve decided to take the fruit

228
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,580
 from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

229
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,220
 I mentioned how their rejection of God

230
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,780
 immediately resulted in the rejection of themselves,

231
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,340
 and they were left with shame and insecurity

232
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,160
 and selfishness in their brokenness.

233
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,420
 We were supposed to be other-centered.

234
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,740
 If you still remember what I talked about two weeks ago,

235
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,380
 we were supposed to care for others,

236
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,200
 meaning that we were supposed to have this capacity

237
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,380
 to care for other people around us

238
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,860
 and also for the rest of God's creation.

239
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,900
 We were supposed to have their best interest in our mind,

240
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,780
 and that's the part of what stewardship would look like,

241
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,180
 that we care for them even more than ourselves sometimes.

242
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,460
 But as we have witnessed this

243
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,500
 in the long history of humanity again and again,

244
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,620
 our selfishness and our self-centeredness

245
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,260
 has corrupted us, right?

246
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,260
 It turns us from stewards into consumers, like takers.

247
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,060
 We take what we want for our own pleasure.

248
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,940
 Our primary goal becomes the satisfactions

249
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,260
 of our own desires over everything else.

250
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,260
 So speaking of consumers,

251
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,980
 I remember when I was a little bit younger,

252
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,420
 what they call in a stormy kind of period of life,

253
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,340
 I couldn't exactly say my relationship with my family,

254
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,120
 especially my parents.

255
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,140
 I can't say it's a loving relationship.

256
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,980
 I remember I didn't talk a lot with them back then.

257
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,900
 So what I do, it's I would always hang out

258
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,340
 with other people or just by myself outside

259
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,460
 until very, very late, until everyone at home is asleep,

260
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,460
 and then I would go home so I don't have to talk to anyone.

261
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,780
 And so because I went home so late

262
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,180
 and I slept in like really, really late as well,

263
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,340
 so by the time I woke up the next morning,

264
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,100
 everybody has gone to work or school or whatever,

265
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,460
 so I never had to speak to anyone.

266
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,820
 Until there was one day, I think my dad was lucky,

267
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,900
 he caught me while both of us were awake,

268
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,220
 and he said this to me,

269
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,500
 "What do you think of this place?

270
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,460
 "Do you treat your home as a hotel?"

271
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:01,340
 And speaking of hotel, I'm actually traveling this week,

272
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,880
 and I must say that sometimes the best part

273
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,380
 of my favorite part of traveling is staying in a hotel

274
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,400
 because I don't have to make my bed in the morning.

275
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,940
 When I wake up, I can mess it up,

276
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,580
 and I go out and I come back,

277
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,460
 oh, it's just new as, you know, it's a new bed.

278
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,000
 I can mess up the bathroom, the entire room,

279
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,460
 I can throw things everywhere.

280
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,380
 When I come back, oh, it's a new room.

281
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,260
 So I can do whatever I want, right?

282
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,640
 And I can, you know, I can mess it up,

283
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,980
 I can do whatever I want,

284
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,980
 and in the hotel, I always get what I want.

285
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,820
 My, you know, I don't have any responsibilities,

286
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,220
 I only have rights there.

287
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,500
 Yeah, I know, of course, I have to pay,

288
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,260
 but then when you go in there,

289
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,260
 you're the customers, you're always right,

290
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,200
 I can get what I want, how I want, when I want.

291
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,940
 That's consumer, rights only, without responsibility.

292
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,420
 And as a result of what happened in the garden

293
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,820
 in Genesis chapter three, humans, we,

294
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,340
 we traded responsible stewardship

295
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,060
 with selfish consumerism.

296
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,260
 Hey, let me say that again.

297
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,720
 We traded responsible stewardship

298
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,220
 with selfish consumerism.

299
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,260
 And that's what we've been doing to our environment,

300
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,580
 to the creation of God, deforestation,

301
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,860
 destruction of natural habitats of many plants

302
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,620
 and animal species in exchange for urban development,

303
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,100
 overfishing, industrial pollution in the air, water,

304
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,740
 just to name a few, and what's really injustice here

305
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,060
 is not just what we do to the environment

306
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,360
 or to the creation of God.

307
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,780
 A lot of times, urban pollution,

308
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,500
 those who are really affected are the poor,

309
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,420
 are the underprivileged.

310
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,060
 And while the rich, the privileged,

311
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,700
 they just enjoy their life and they continue

312
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,220
 with their lifestyle and the pollution went on and on,

313
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,100
 and those who suffer are normally those without resources.

314
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,080
 That's injustice.

315
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,480
 The breakdown of our relationship

316
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,380
 with the environment or creation

317
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,180
 didn't just come from a sinfulness,

318
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,000
 although we just talk about that,

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,900
 it also comes from the judgment of God.

320
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,500
 So we know that actually God talked to Adam and Eve

321
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,260
 after they took the fruit, after they tried to hide.

322
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,420
 This is where I left off last time,

323
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,420
 so I'm gonna read from Genesis 3, let's start with 17.

324
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,860
 So to Adam, God said, "Because you listened to your wife

325
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,420
 "and ate fruit from the tree which I commanded you

326
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,060
 "you must not eat from it,

327
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,100
 "cursed is the ground because of you.

328
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,820
 "Through painful toil, you will eat fruit from it

329
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,780
 "all the days of your life," and so on and on and on.

330
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,140
 So here we see something that we might have missed

331
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,900
 in our reading of the Bible.

332
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,380
 What we see here, it's a fundamental change

333
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,140
 in the relationship between human beings

334
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,700
 and the land and the rest of creation.

335
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,180
 Our job as humans was to work and to take care of the land

336
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,180
 and it would, on your hand, produce and provide what we need

337
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,540
 but it will now be done in the context of brokenness,

338
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,420
 hard labor and potential fruitlessness.

339
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,580
 So we can work all day and we can farm

340
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,340
 but maybe there are storms or there are calamities

341
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,940
 and the ground is not producing what we want.

342
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,260
 So we experience that, we experience fruitlessness

343
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,420
 and our relationship with the earth,

344
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,580
 with the creation, it's broken.

345
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,060
 Let me read to you from a Bible scholar,

346
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,740
 his name is Douglas Moo.

347
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,860
 It's a little bit long but I'm just gonna read from it.

348
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,940
 He says, "While creation, not in itself,

349
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,380
 "guilty of sin, creation suffers

350
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,500
 "because of the sin of human beings,"

351
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,780
 which we just talked about.

352
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,020
 "The sin of Adam brought God's curse on creation,

353
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,780
 "a curse that focuses on new estrangement

354
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,140
 "between humans and creation.

355
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,780
 "Continuing human sin corrupts creation in various ways.

356
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,980
 "We selfishly and mindlessly consume its resources.

357
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,940
 "We pollute it with unsafe manufacturing processes.

358
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,940
 "We accelerate potential harmful atmospheric changes

359
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,060
 "by pouring greenhouse gases into the air.

360
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,180
 "Simply put, the decay of creation means

361
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,320
 "that it is used and abused in ways God never intended,

362
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,480
 "preventing it from being what it was designed to be

363
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,480
 "and thereby hindering its ability fully to glorify God."

364
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,860
 So there's one thing very important.

365
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,300
 We thought as human beings we are the only creation

366
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,400
 and the entire world that only we could glorify God

367
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,340
 because we are the image of God.

368
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,440
 Sorry, that's not what the Bible is saying.

369
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,780
 The Bible says God takes glory in his entire creation.

370
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,760
 When you look at sunrise or sunset,

371
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,100
 when you look at the beauty of it,

372
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,520
 normally your first reaction is, wow, God, you're amazing.

373
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,360
 But nowadays in Hong Kong, you try to look at a sunset,

374
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,400
 oh, it's foggy, that's smoky,

375
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,560
 like I can't see the sunset really.

376
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,460
 Our pollution, we are undermining the creation's ability

377
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,660
 to reflect God's glory.

378
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,460
 Just one very small example.

379
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,720
 This is what he's saying.

380
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,720
 This is what happens when the earth is filled

381
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,440
 with selfish consumers rather than faithful stewards.

382
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,320
 And it is taking up more and more airtime

383
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,360
 on our news in recent years.

384
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,800
 It's not too hard for us to notice that this generation,

385
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,560
 our generation, is starting to witness

386
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,200
 and even suffer from the consequences of human selfishness

387
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,960
 and abuse towards the environment.

388
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,840
 Hottest mid-autumn or whatever day every year.

389
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,740
 If every year the temperature,

390
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,440
 we have a record-breaking temperature,

391
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,800
 it's getting hotter and hotter,

392
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,580
 could you even imagine what it's gonna look like

393
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,800
 in a children's generation?

394
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,840
 And in the generation of the children of our children?

395
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,200
 What would that look like?

396
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,560
 Sometimes when I think of my kids, I'm like,

397
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,120
 if I'm feeling so horrible right now,

398
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,500
 what are they gonna go through in 30 years time

399
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,920
 when they're my age?

400
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,680
 The stewards are irresponsible, that's unfortunate.

401
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,220
 But the good news is that the owner is always faithful.

402
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,580
 And here's the important part we always miss out

403
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,740
 in the story of God, that Christ,

404
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,580
 He didn't just come to redeem you and me or humanity.

405
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,580
 He came to redeem and restore His entire creation.

406
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,340
 We can see His end game in the last book of the Bible,

407
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,260
 which is Revelation.

408
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,940
 He's going to renew His creation.

409
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,800
 He's going to make all things new.

410
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,080
 And you have to note that,

411
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,920
 He's not going to make all new things.

412
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,200
 He's going to make all things new.

413
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,140
 He's going to renew His whole creation.

414
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,600
 So we now have a creation that is suffering

415
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,280
 because of the sins of human,

416
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,760
 but God has promised that one day

417
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,520
 He will make all things new

418
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,640
 when Jesus eventually comes back

419
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,320
 as the glorious and victorious King

420
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,640
 to right every wrong and to destroy evil

421
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,500
 from the planet earth once and for all.

422
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,540
 And so I want to, in light of this,

423
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,700
 I want to read to you what Paul wrote in Romans 8,

424
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,420
 which you may have read, but found it a little bit weird.

425
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,260
 I'm telling you, a lot of us, a lot of churches,

426
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,180
 we never talk about justice and creation.

427
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,600
 We never read the Bible this way.

428
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,180
 So this part of the Bible or these couple of verses

429
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,860
 always seem very weird to us.

430
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,120
 But if you could look at these verses

431
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,420
 through the lens of justice and creation,

432
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,180
 everything would become just crystal clear.

433
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,120
 Let me read it to you.

434
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,120
 Romans 8, starting from verse 19.

435
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,660
 For the creation waits in eager expectation

436
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,260
 for the children of God to be revealed.

437
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,980
 Just let me pause and explain to you here.

438
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,540
 Who's the children of God here?

439
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,700
 Anybody?

440
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,040
 Okay, got a few at least, not bad.

441
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,900
 I expected a little bit more.

442
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,640
 I hope we should really work hard on evangelism, Tim.

443
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,460
 Anyway, okay.

444
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:26,100
 As the children of God here, we're saved by grace.

445
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,980
 We're saved by Jesus.

446
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,380
 And so what does revelation of God's children

447
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,340
 mean by Paul here?

448
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,140
 We have been through the Galatians series.

449
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,920
 We know that now God causes his children, we're in Jesus,

450
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,380
 and he sends his spirit of his son into us.

451
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,300
 So now we're his children, we're his sons and daughters.

452
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,980
 But we know that even though we're saved,

453
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,980
 we're not experiencing the entire eternal life right now

454
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,420
 because we're still going through sickness and death

455
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,700
 on this planet.

456
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,900
 So eternal life, it started already,

457
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,460
 but we only experience the fullness of it

458
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,740
 when Jesus come back, when our bodies,

459
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,820
 these dead bodies will resurrect one day with him

460
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,620
 because of his resurrection.

461
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,080
 We're going to resurrect with him.

462
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,620
 That's the day when the children of God are fully revealed.

463
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,580
 So this is what Paul is talking about here.

464
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,940
 The creation waits in eager expectation for that day,

465
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,580
 for the children of God to be revealed.

466
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,620
 For the creation was subjected to frustration

467
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,180
 or fertility in some versions, not by his own choice,

468
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,100
 but by the will of the one who subjected it

469
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,740
 because of the sins of human, because we're tied together.

470
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,820
 God subjected creation to humans.

471
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,700
 When we sin, when we choose to pollute this earth,

472
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,380
 it's affected.

473
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,300
 This earth, this creation, it was supposed to reflect

474
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,580
 the glory of God, but now that purpose was destroyed as well

475
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,940
 because of our sin.

476
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,680
 It was subjected to frustration, subjected to fertility.

477
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,900
 But in, let me just see where I am.

478
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,660
 But yeah, so verse 21, in hope that the creation itself

479
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,820
 will be liberated from its bondage to decay

480
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,620
 and brought into the freedom and glory of children of God.

481
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,060
 Again, our glory comes from the day

482
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,760
 when Christ finally returns as the victorious King

483
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,020
 and we will experience resurrection.

484
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,420
 And that day is the day the entire creation

485
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,900
 is looking forward to.

486
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,820
 They would experience liberation from bondage to decay.

487
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,740
 Let's see what we're doing to the earth right now.

488
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,300
 It's getting worse and worse, it's decaying.

489
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,340
 But that day when the sons and daughters of God are revealed

490
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,080
 when we are finally standing in a glory with Jesus,

491
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,200
 the entire earth, they will be liberated.

492
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,040
 Why?

493
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,400
 Because it's not just about us getting into heaven

494
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,040
 and like, oh hallelujah.

495
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,520
 It's about us being restored first as sons and daughters

496
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,880
 of God and we will stand in a rightful place

497
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,240
 when a relationship with God is restored,

498
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,240
 a rightful place as stewards of this planet

499
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,260
 will be restored.

500
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,920
 And then we would know it's time for us to work,

501
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,960
 to avart and to shamar, to care for the entire creation

502
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,280
 around us when the sons and daughters of God are restored

503
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,920
 and we're standing in that glory

504
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,000
 when we are so secure in our identity in Christ,

505
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,920
 we know we are sons and daughters of God.

506
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,800
 We know we're supposed to be in a partnership with Him

507
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,720
 to take care of the entire creation.

508
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,920
 We're supposed to rule over it.

509
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,560
 And when we accept that responsibility,

510
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,380
 that's the liberation of the creation.

511
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,800
 They can finally say, oh, thank you.

512
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,260
 I love verse 22.

513
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,700
 It says, we know that the whole creation has been groaning

514
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,380
 as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.

515
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,260
 I have the privilege to witness childbirth

516
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,340
 two times in my life.

517
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,180
 And it's painful to watch, to even just watch.

518
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,280
 Of course, also because that person will pinch you,

519
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,820
 but it's just painful to watch

520
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,540
 without her pinching me as well.

521
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:19,300
 Anyway, yeah, it's really painful.

522
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,220
 But in that pain, (groans)

523
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,620
 you know something beautiful, it's coming.

524
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,500
 That's what's happening with creation.

525
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,740
 They know that the new creation is coming.

526
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,540
 They know Jesus is coming back to right every wrong,

527
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,060
 to make all things new.

528
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,420
 They are suffering right now,

529
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,660
 but they're looking forward to that day

530
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,520
 when God finally comes back

531
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,800
 and all his people will stand with him

532
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,480
 in their rightful place at the steward of this world.

533
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,540
 And they are waiting, eagerly waiting for that day.

534
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,520
 They say, finally, please, I want that day to come quickly.

535
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,480
 Please, they're groaning right now.

536
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,800
 And that is what is happening with creation right now.

537
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,200
 Paul is saying, you know what?

538
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,280
 The entire creation is suffering just like you and me.

539
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,600
 We're suffering from sickness, from pain,

540
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,460
 from this life as well.

541
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,760
 But we know that one day

542
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,740
 we would experience bodily resurrection.

543
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:17,040
 And in the same way, the creation will be renewed.

544
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,920
 And they are also looking forward to that

545
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,920
 when God comes back and make all things new.

546
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,420
 You see, the cross of Jesus

547
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,920
 restored our relationship with God,

548
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,560
 with ourselves, with others.

549
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,960
 And it restored our relationship with the creation as well.

550
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,960
 He reconciled us back to, Jesus reconciled us back to him,

551
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,140
 to God, and so we can trust him.

552
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,460
 We can follow him.

553
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,840
 We can obey him.

554
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,740
 We can be obedient to his standards

555
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,820
 of right and wrong, of good and evil.

556
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,420
 And we can finally partner with him

557
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,840
 to rule over his creation.

558
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,960
 We can only do it if we say amen to his standards.

559
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,320
 When we obey him.

560
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,660
 We cannot do it in our own way.

561
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,920
 Otherwise, we're just gonna be selfish consumers.

562
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,600
 We're just gonna mess it up again.

563
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,540
 Only when we come finally with obedience to Jesus,

564
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,160
 we can take up that rightful place as stewards,

565
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,040
 as rulers in this planet,

566
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,480
 to work to take care of the creation

567
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,460
 that God has put in our charge.

568
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:26,180
 So church, that means being a disciple of Jesus,

569
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:31,120
 we now move from selfish consumerism

570
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,320
 back to faithful and responsible stewardship.

571
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,640
 That's what being a Christian is all about.

572
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,080
 Oh, not all about, but yeah, there's so many things,

573
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,460
 but this is one of the many things.

574
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,680
 And the theologian John Stott, he put it this way.

575
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,120
 He said, "Our care of the creation

576
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,280
 "will reflect our love of the creator."

577
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,680
 Can I get an amen for that?

578
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,720
 It's time for us to do that.

579
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,440
 I'm just gonna quote one more theologian.

580
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,680
 His name is Chris Wright.

581
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,720
 Says this, "It seems quite inexplicable to me

582
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,220
 "that there are some Christians

583
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,100
 "who claim to love and worship God,

584
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,460
 "to be disciples of Jesus,

585
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,780
 "and yet have no concern for the earth

586
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,240
 "that bears his stamp of ownership.

587
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,560
 "They do not care about the abuse of the earth,

588
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,540
 "and indeed, by their wasteful

589
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,760
 "and over-consumptive lifestyles,

590
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,620
 "they contribute to it."

591
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,880
 Guilty as charged.

592
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,360
 (audience member speaking faintly)

593
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,000
 If you wanna know how we're supposed to rule over creation,

594
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,800
 I think we just need to look at Jesus.

595
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,260
 In Matthew 5, verse five, Jesus says this.

596
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,380
 He says, "Blessed are the meek,

597
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,840
 "for they will inherit the earth."

598
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,440
 Jesus presented meekness as a profound quality

599
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,360
 that contrasts sharply with typical notions

600
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,940
 of power and authority.

601
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,240
 If we follow the example of Jesus,

602
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,000
 it would mean rejecting exploitative power

603
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,800
 and embracing stewardship rooted in love.

604
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,440
 Our authority over creation should be characterized

605
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,520
 by compassion, by restoration, and by service.

606
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,280
 We should be serving the environment around us.

607
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,540
 So I know this is, whoa, theology.

608
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,160
 This is like, whoa, very, in Singlish,

609
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,380
 they call it very chim, which means very abstract, right?

610
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,500
 No, very deep, very profound.

611
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,220
 I still get Singlish wrong, anyway.

612
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,100
 But I've got three very practical tips for us.

613
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,880
 Some of them you might have heard of it before.

614
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,840
 Some of them, hopefully, you're practicing,

615
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,980
 but let's just go through them.

616
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,380
 I think we can live sustainably,

617
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,380
 and it cannot be overemphasized in our age right now.

618
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,220
 If you're not using those lights or fans

619
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,720
 or electrical appliances, just,

620
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,600
 there's an off button there, you know, right?

621
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,360
 Just switch it off.

622
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,080
 You know, don't use too many papers.

623
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,400
 You know, recycle, the three R's,

624
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,600
 reduce, recycle, and reuse.

625
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,160
 You know, all these, we've been educated enough,

626
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,780
 we have enough knowledge to live sustainably.

627
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,720
 Quoting Master Yoda from Star Wars,

628
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,620
 stop trying and just do it, all right?

629
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,360
 Number two, consume consciously.

630
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,800
 I have a confession.

631
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,280
 I have spent less money in the past year,

632
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,760
 partly because I switched to a part-time role

633
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,040
 from a full-time role,

634
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,640
 and then I started challenging myself,

635
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,400
 do I really need those stuff that I casually buy

636
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,740
 without even looking at the price tag?

637
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,960
 And then I realized in the past year,

638
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,840
 I bought a lot less clutter,

639
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,960
 according to Rosalind, those are clutter.

640
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,440
 So I, and I still survive, or I thrive,

641
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,000
 like nothing is wrong with me,

642
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,080
 and I'm enjoying my life,

643
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,080
 so buying less is not a problem at all.

644
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,480
 And I'm telling you, you know how fast

645
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,880
 the expansion of the population has been.

646
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,880
 Currently, in 2020, it was about 60 billion,

647
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,840
 six billion, 60 billion?

648
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,760
 Too bad, six billion, six billion.

649
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,320
 2020, it was about six billion people.

650
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,960
 Right now, seven-something billion people.

651
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,760
 Projection says by 2050,

652
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,920
 there will be 9.5 billion people on the planet.

653
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,940
 Do you know what that means?

654
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,840
 Number one, there will be food shortage,

655
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,880
 and number two, we're creating a lot of rubbish every day.

656
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,280
 Every time I taobao, I have a confession to God,

657
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,280
 secretly I'm like, God, I don't know why they do that.

658
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,280
 I just buy this small part of a camera, accessories,

659
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,720
 and they give me a box like this.

660
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,920
 God, forgive me, and forgive them.

661
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,720
 The more we consume, the more we create waste.

662
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,400
 So consume consciously.

663
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:08,120
 And number three, choose simplicity.

664
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,840
 Do you know that simplicity is actually

665
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,480
 a spiritual discipline in Christianity?

666
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,460
 We are supposed to live a simple life,

667
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,300
 life doesn't have to be too complicated.

668
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,980
 You don't need like 10 holidays,

669
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,860
 you don't need like 10 different sets of headphones,

670
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,420
 or 10 different watches, or 10 different,

671
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,940
 sorry, sorry, I see somebody looking at their wrist

672
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,260
 immediately, sorry, sorry, sorry, okay.

673
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,740
 But you know, you get what I mean.

674
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,580
 We can choose simplicity,

675
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,900
 we can consume consciously, responsibly,

676
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,620
 we can live sustainably.

677
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,420
 I actually have an open water scuba diver license,

678
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,500
 to your surprise.

679
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,020
 So I used to be part of a diver's community,

680
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,740
 and every year around spring,

681
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,380
 the diver's community would go out,

682
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,660
 go to Saicom or somewhere,

683
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,540
 they would dive and clean the bottom of the ocean.

684
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,380
 And do you know what day that is?

685
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,540
 Do you know what day they choose to do that?

686
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,780
 No, it's spring, so they chose to,

687
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,460
 close, they actually, not the birthday of Jesus,

688
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,620
 they chose to do it in the Tin Hao birthday.

689
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,260
 So you know that place Tin Hao in Causeway Bay, right?

690
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,460
 Tin Hao, it's actually the goddess of sea

691
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,540
 in the Chinese tradition.

692
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,980
 What does that mean?

693
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,020
 It means that there are people in this city

694
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,020
 choosing to avart, to shamar the creation of God

695
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,500
 in the name of an idol.

696
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,540
 And we're doing nothing.

697
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:52,700
 If we are truly followers of Jesus,

698
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,100
 if we truly understand what it means

699
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,540
 that the earth belongs to God,

700
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,180
 he has his ownership, but we have a stewardship,

701
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,540
 but if we really understand what stewardship

702
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,340
 in Christ look like,

703
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,740
 I think there's so much more we can do

704
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,300
 for the creation of God.

705
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,700
 Can I get an amen for that?

706
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,100
 How about we invite the Holy Spirit

707
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,940
 to convict our hearts and why don't we pray together now?

708
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,780
 Let's pray.

709
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:27,140
 Yeah, God, like thinking of people

710
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,460
 who are caring for your creation in the name of an idol

711
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,180
 give me goosebumps, like, oh, I can't live with it.

712
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,100
 But yeah, God, we are, as Christians,

713
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,060
 as the rightful stewards of your creation,

714
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,020
 we are doing nothing.

715
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,060
 We thought it's not in the Bible,

716
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,620
 I didn't see environmental protection in the Bible,

717
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,780
 so it's none of my business, I don't have to do anything.

718
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,780
 Father, we are sorry

719
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:02,540
 that we, maybe many people in this room, like me,

720
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,380
 we could identify more with the selfish consumer

721
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,300
 rather than the faithful stewards in your kingdom.

722
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,460
 God, we pray for your forgiveness.

723
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,860
 Father, we come before you today to confess our sins,

724
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,900
 to say that, Lord, we know we have been contributing

725
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,540
 to injustice in this world

726
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,020
 because our relationship with the creation was broken.

727
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,180
 Our relationship with you is broken.

728
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,260
 So, God, we just pray that today you will come

729
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,380
 and restore those relationships.

730
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,220
 I pray that there will be a conviction in our hearts

731
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,620
 in your church today

732
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:51,180
 that we know what it means to be your sons and daughters,

733
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,660
 to be stewards of your creation,

734
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,300
 what it means to rule over

735
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,780
 with the heart of Jesus,

736
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,300
 to protect, to conserve,

737
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,860
 to serve.

738
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:13,980
 Father, we just pray that you will come and speak to us

739
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,420
 in our everyday life.

740
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,700
 And if there are initiatives,

741
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,100
 if there are things that we can do,

742
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,140
 we pray you just give us that prompt and say,

743
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,780
 "Hey, let's go and do it."

744
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,900
 Father, we pray we will be protector of your creation,

745
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,980
 not destroyer.

746
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,980
 So come, Holy Spirit.

747
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,260
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
