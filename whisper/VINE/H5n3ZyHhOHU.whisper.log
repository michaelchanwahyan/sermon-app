[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   Nice to meet you. Wow. Welcome to the Vine. My name is Andrew. Oh I'm so excited. I'm
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.040]   so glad you're here. If you're joining us online right now, we're so glad that
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.960]   you're joining us online right now. I do two things when the Holy Spirit is here.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.920]   Just be aware. Two things. One is I clap. The other is I cry. I will try my best
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.160]   not to cry, but I might clap a little bit with you today. Is that alright? Are you
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.560]   guys okay? Alright. So just a few years ago, and by that I mean about 15 years
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.560]   ago, when you get older the past seems a little bit closer. It's about 15 years
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.480]   ago. I woke up one morning and I went to my sink and I looked in the mirror. Now
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.600]   who knows that it's a bad idea to look in the mirror first thing in the morning,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.760]   right? And so I wake up and do the thing that you should not do first thing in
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.960]   the morning. Go straight to the sink. I'm washing my hands. I look up. I look at
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.760]   myself in the mirror and it's weird because as I'm looking in the mirror,
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.120]   this thought goes through my head. Look at your back. When was the last time you
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.240]   looked at your back? We human beings do not look at our back very often, okay?
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.360]   It's actually kind of hard to look at your back, right? So I hear this voice.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.560]   Look at your back. And I'm like, "Okay." And I'm kind of like spinning this, trying to
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.640]   look in my back and I see something on my back I'd never seen before. I saw it
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.120]   a little lump. And the little lump was there very noticeably, kind of small,
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.480]   small but noticeable on my back. And the annoying thing is it was at that
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.520]   place in your back that you can't touch. You know there's like that bit right
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.840]   there that you cannot touch? It was sitting right there. And I was like, "Oh,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.240]   that's interesting." But it didn't hurt. I couldn't feel it. It didn't bother me. I
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.280]   never really saw it. So I just ignored it. And I just carried on with my life. Word
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.840]   of warning, do not do that. About six months later, I wake up. And as I wake up,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.600]   I feel this incredible pain on my back. I feel this pain that's kind of stretching
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.580]   and pulling and it feels like there's fire on my back. And I go to the
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.320]   mirror and I turn and I look at my back and sure enough that little lump from
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.000]   six months ago has now turned into a big golf ball sitting on my back. And not
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.520]   only is it a golf ball, but it's red and it's inflamed and it's angry looking. And
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.920]   every single time I turn my back, it sends sheets of pain across my back.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.120]   And so I go to the doctor that day and I show him the big kind of bump on my
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.960]   back. And he looks at it and he kind of prods it a little bit. And he goes, "I think
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.880]   it's a cyst. Let me refer you to a specialist." So the next day I go to this
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.000]   specialist. And the specialist is like using his fingers and prodding this
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.400]   thing. And he's like, "Yep, yep, yep. This is a sebaceous cyst. But don't worry. It's
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:09.520]   not a big deal. We can open you up, pop it out, and zip you back up again. It'll
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.600]   take about 15 minutes. You can do it on your lunch break." Talk about efficient
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.680]   Hong Kong, right? Like you don't need to miss any work. You can keep making money.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.120]   You can do it on your lunch break. One hour to deal with the thing on your back.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.520]   He's like, "It's super easy. I open you up. I pop it out. I zip you back up in 15
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.200]   minutes and back to the office." I'm like, "Cool." I was working in investment banking
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.160]   at the time. I'm like, "I don't have to skip any making money time. All right." So I
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.480]   make my appointment next week. On a Wednesday, I go into this guy's office. He
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.360]   has like a massage table in the office. There's like one of those faces,
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.920]   like little holes where you put your face in it, right? So you can breathe. I'm
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.640]   lying down on this thing. And he goes, "Okay, here's what we're gonna do. I'm just
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.160]   gonna inject some local anesthetic around the little lump there, the cyst.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.920]   I'm then gonna open you up, pop it out, and zip you back up again and get you
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.760]   back to your office with a sandwich." He opens me up, and then I hear this.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.160]   "Oh no." Now normally when you're having surgery, you're passed out because they
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.600]   give you general anesthetic, right? And you don't hear anything, right? And the
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.360]   doctors could talk about anything about you, and you would have no idea. But when
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.600]   you're just getting local anesthetic, you're fully awake. And the last thing
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.000]   you want to hear when the doctor opens you up is, "Oh no." So I'm lying there, trying
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.640]   not to panic, and I go, "Locker!" Because my mouth is a little bit muffled by the
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:51.240]   thing I'm lying on. "Locker! Locker!" He's like, "Well, I opened you up, sir, and your
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.280]   cyst is actually attached to your back muscle." Because I didn't realize that
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.360]   it's attached to your back muscle. So it's gonna be a bit harder to remove.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.480]   Now, what the doctor should have done at that moment was zip me back up again,
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.560]   make an appointment for some major surgery, actually give me general
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.600]   anesthetic, and remove it however he wanted to. But did he do that? No. He
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.720]   decides to give me a little bit more general anesthetic, a bit of local anesthetic,
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.800]   a few more injections, so that he could begin to cut the cyst out of my back
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.840]   muscles. Now, you have to understand that the cyst was so entangled around my
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.160]   muscles that in order to get it out, he actually had to end up cutting my back
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.400]   muscle. Now, back muscles are a little bit like... Probably the way to
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.440]   describe it to you, it's a little bit like piano wire in a piano. And imagine
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.440]   getting like a cutter and cutting the piano wire. It's like, "Ping!" Like this, right?
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.320]   That's what it's like if somebody wants to cut your back muscle to get a cyst
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.760]   out of it. It is excruciatingly painful, and the surface numbing of local
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:12.840]   anesthetic does nothing to dull that pain. Literally, "K-k-k-k-k-ping! K-k-k-k-k-ping!"
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:20.120]   I was screaming my head off. Within about half an hour, I kid you not, they run out
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.240]   of local anesthetic in the clinic. They have injected me so much, tears streaming
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.640]   out of my eyes. I'm screaming all the time. They're trying... Everybody else, I
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.360]   don't know who was in the waiting room, but whoever was in that waiting room
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.960]   left. They were like, "I am not going in to see that doctor," right? The guy's like...
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.120]   Like, they run, literally run out of local anesthetic. I'm crying. I'm screaming.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.480]   He's panicking. He's still cutting because he thinks, "The faster I cut, the
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.160]   quicker I can get this thing out of this guy, and he'll be..." After a while, he
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:04.080]   leans forward by my ear, and he says, "Valium?" I'm like, "Yes, Valium! Thank you."
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:12.640]   He injects Valium into my arm, and suddenly, I'm with Jesus. Life was good again.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.280]   Literally, within seconds, my whole body was flooded with this sense of, "You can
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.440]   do anything you want." It took him almost two hours to cut out my cyst.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.600]   I'm not gonna show it to you, but I have the ugliest scar on my back. It
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.400]   was so painful. I had about a month's worth of physiotherapy afterwards, and I
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.600]   was literally in trauma, the kind of trauma that makes you want to sue a
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:46.120]   doctor. But the Bible says, "Do not sue." Okay, so I did not sue the doctor, all
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.000]   right? Did not sue him. About a month and a half later, God began to speak to me
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.800]   out of that experience. Who knows that if you have a really traumatic experience,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.240]   God likes to speak to you. And God begins to speak to me out of this experience,
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.960]   and he says this, "Andrew, do you remember that really painful experience with your
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.720]   cyst?" And I'm like, "Yeah, I remember that." He's like, "That's just how you treat your
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:14.880]   sin." I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "That's just how you treat your sin. You know, you
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.840]   kind of casually kind of go, 'Oh, yeah, that's there.' And then you kind of think it's
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.720]   like no big deal. You kind of just go on with your life, and you don't really do
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.920]   much about it. You actually don't do anything about it, Andrew, until it starts
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.800]   to hurt. Until it's a bit painful for you or painful for someone else. Then you
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.600]   think you might need to deal with it. And then when you think you need
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.960]   to deal with it, you think it's just a surface issue. You think you can open
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   yourself up, pop it out, and zip yourself back up again, and everything's gonna be
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.400]   fine, 15 minutes back from lunch. But God was saying, "Andrew, you need to
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:59.600]   understand that your sin so easily entangles," Hebrew 12 verse 1, "and it's so
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.960]   easily entangles that what you think is a surface thing actually gets much
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.080]   deeper into you, actually has the power to get in there with roots that you
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.760]   can't with any local anesthetic. Just think you're gonna pop it up, zip it out,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.320]   and off you go." He's like, "You gotta understand that actually, so often when
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.880]   you deal with your sin, Andrew, you try some behavioral management because you
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.920]   think that's all you need to do for something surface." And I thought about it
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.400]   later, and I thought, "This is so true. This is what so much we do as Christians. We
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.000]   think our sin is like some surface issue, so we just apply some behavioral
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   management. Oh, I'm a little bit angry this week. I'm gonna try and be a nicer
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.680]   person. Oh yeah, there's that website I keep going to that I know I shouldn't go
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:51.360]   to. I'm gonna download that software next week that'll help me not to go there," or
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.360]   whatever the issue might be. And we think some clever little behavior change
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.720]   in us is gonna deal with that issue, and then we're shocked and angry at God when
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:10.360]   three weeks later we do it again, and it pops back up in our life again. And God
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   is saying, "Andrew, you need to understand that your sin is not some surface issue
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.200]   that you can just lightly deal with. You need to understand that there's no local
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.920]   anesthetic that's ever gonna deal with your sin. What you need, Andrew, is a
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.080]   complete regeneration of your person. What you need is a complete regeneration
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.600]   of your spirit, and if you would just give me your life, if you just open
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:38.640]   yourself up to me one more time, I could actually come and totally renew you so
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:47.720]   that your future would be just as you want it to be." This idea of being
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:54.560]   completely regenerated by the power of God is the next step in the journey that
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.400]   God takes Israel on, as he wants them to see the new thing that he's doing
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.760]   amongst them. If you've been coming to the Vine over the last couple of weeks, you
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.400]   know we're in this series where God is doing a new thing over Israel. In fact, in
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.760]   Isaiah 43, verses 16 onwards, he declares, "I'm doing a new thing. Right now it's
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.520]   springing up." And then he asks Israel a question, "Do you not perceive it? Can you
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.920]   see the new thing that I'm doing amongst you?" And really, from Isaiah 40 to 66,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:30.840]   it's this beautiful prophetic verse, poem of Isaiah speaking out over Israel and
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.680]   saying, "I'm doing a new thing and I want you to see it, and here's the things in
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.280]   your life that's stopping you from seeing the new thing that I'm about to
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.480]   do." So in week one, we looked at how expectations stop us from seeing the new
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.160]   thing of God. Both good and bad expectations of how God has acted in the
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.680]   past actually causes us to put God in a box of how we think he's going to act in
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.160]   the present and future. And so often we miss out on the new thing God does
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.920]   because we think we're looking in the box for him to act this way when God
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.680]   actually wants to act in a new way. And then last week, we looked at another
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.240]   thing that stops us from seeing God acting new in the world. And it's because
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.880]   we're not looking in the right place. It's because we're actually not going to
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.440]   the very people that God is often doing that new work in. As Israel are
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:25.680]   challenged by God in Isaiah 58, they need a new fast. Their current fast, their
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.080]   current traditions, their current practices were not suitable for seeing
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.680]   the new. In fact, they had forgotten the poor, the vulnerable, the marginalized, the
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.400]   hurting. And if they were to go to them and actually begin to do the very things
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.440]   that Christ had called them to do, use their resources to bless the poor, make
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.880]   sure they're not so hungry, clothe the naked, find housing for the homeless. As
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.320]   they began to do that, they would actually begin to see the new thing God
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.040]   is doing because the new is happening amongst the very people they were
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:02.480]   avoiding. And then he gets where we are today. I've dealt with your expectations.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.320]   I've told you where the new is happening. Now I want to deal with the one thing
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:17.440]   that got you into exile in the first place. I want to deal with your sin. Oh, I
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.080]   know what you're thinking right now. You're thinking, "Why did I come to church
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.600]   today?" You're thinking, "Man, I could have gone hiking. There was a great barbecue
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:32.840]   and I said no. And now I got to sit through a pastor talking about sin." Which
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.280]   really raises the existential question for many of you in this room. What time
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:44.400]   is lunch? But I want to encourage you to hang in because I actually want to
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.960]   approach this issue of sin from an angle that perhaps you've actually never
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.520]   thought about it before. I want to approach it actually through the lens of
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.800]   Isaiah and how Isaiah approaches it to Israel at a great time, a critical time
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.880]   in their history. I want to actually show you God's heart for why God wants to
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.040]   deal with this sin issue in Israel so that they might be able to see the new
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.240]   thing he's about to do. And the reason why that's exciting is because God is
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:18.280]   super excited about that new thing and he doesn't want them to miss it. See,
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.000]   follow me church. So often when we think about sin and we talk about sin, what
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.520]   goes through our mind is that God's angry. He wants to punish us. We've done
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.200]   wrong and so we need to get punished for that thing so that we can be made new in
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:38.000]   him. When actually what is really on God's heart is your future. What's
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.040]   really on his heart is what he wants to do through your life. What's really on
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.720]   his heart is your flourishing and who you are as a person. And God sees who you
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:52.320]   could become. He sees who he's created you to be. He looks at you and says, "Man,
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.520]   that one, oh I've got so many plans for this one. I've got so many things I want
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.920]   to do. I don't want them to miss out on anything." In other words, his heart
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:06.320]   towards our brokenness is not to punish us but release us. It's not to
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.560]   come and say, "Hey, this is a really bad thing you've done and make us feel
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.720]   guilty and shameful and horrible." It's to say, "Man, if you could only see this
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.080]   thing that I'm gonna do through you, you would throw off the shackles of your
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:24.120]   bonds and you would walk into freedom. I'm so excited for you." And God comes
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.160]   over Israel at this critical moment of their history and says, "The Messiah is
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:34.120]   ahead of you. Jesus is ahead of you. He's coming and I don't want you to miss
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:40.040]   seeing him. I don't want your sin to blind you from seeing who he is so that when he
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.200]   comes you're not able to receive the gift of full life that he wants you to
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.720]   bring. No, no, no. I love you so much that I will speak to you about the very
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:55.800]   things that are likely to blind you from seeing the gift that I'm giving you." Are
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:02.000]   you with me, church? Do you get a sense of God's heart? See, God's passion against the
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.400]   sin of Israel is not about their past and some need for punishment, but about
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:15.600]   their future and their need for life. And it's the same for you. His passion for
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.200]   you to speak about some of the areas in which you're broken right now is because
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.400]   he's so passionate about the life that he wants to bring into you. And so God
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.200]   brings Isaiah, this prophetic word, to stand over his people and say, "Hey, the
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.680]   Redeemer is coming. Jesus is coming. Prepare my people. I'm doing a new thing.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.760]   I want them to see it and the only way they're gonna see it is if they allow me
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:50.880]   to regenerate them. No local anesthetic is gonna do it, but I've got the one who
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:57.240]   can truly set them free." Are you with me? Hopefully now you don't want to go for
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:07.120]   lunch as we open up God's Word together. Here's Isaiah 59, verse 1, the chapter in
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   which God is gonna deal big with the brokenness and sin of Israel. I want you
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.200]   to see how he starts. He says, "Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save,
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.600]   nor is his ear too dull to hear." I want you to see this right at the start. God's
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.800]   about to speak some pretty big stuff to Israel about their sin and about their
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.960]   brokenness, but I want you to see how he starts it. I want you to see the doorway
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.400]   through which he moves. He goes, "Here's the first thing and the last thing you
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:42.000]   need to know about me. I'm mighty to save. My arm is not too short to save you, nor
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.280]   are my ears too dull to hear you." In other words, what he's saying over Israel
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.000]   is, before we talk about anything else, before we talk about some of the
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.960]   brokenness that's going on, you need to know my heart. My heart is I'm here for
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:59.080]   you. I'm for you. I'm not against you. I'm fighting battles for you. I can save you,
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.880]   redeem you, renew you, set you free. I can turn you into the person that you were
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.480]   always designed to be. My ear is not deaf from your cries. My arm is not weak to
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:15.400]   save you. There is nothing you have done, God is saying to Israel, that has changed
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:22.720]   me. Come on, church. See, I think we think that our sin changes God. We think that
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.120]   our brokenness has some effect on him where he gets suddenly angry or distant
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.600]   or removed or separated. He starts his great chapter about sin by saying, "I'm
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.840]   right here. I've not given up on you. I've not gone from you. My heart is here for
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.920]   you." Why? Because it's just who I am and whatever you do does not change me. I'm
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.720]   the same yesterday, today, and forever. I love you. I've got you. I'm singing your
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:53.640]   praises. I'm here for you. I will save you. I'm not deaf from you. Some of you in
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:01.720]   this room, your starting point is God can't do this for me. Your starting point
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.040]   when you think about your sin is, "I just can't break it, you know? It's habitual.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:12.320]   It just always happens." Some of you, your starting point is, "God's angry at me. He's
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:19.120]   upset at me. He's not speaking to me anymore. He's distant from me." I think
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:26.600]   Israel had every reason to feel that way and God starts by saying, "I'm here. I'm
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:34.000]   for you. I can save you. I'm hearing you and you need to know that before you
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.080]   know anything." For some of you in this room, that will set you free today. Just
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:46.320]   that simple thing that your sin has not changed God. It has changed some things
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.640]   and we're gonna get on to talk about that, but it hasn't changed God or how
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:20:03.080]   God sees you. Are you with me, church? Is anyone here? Come on. I'm clapping, see? But
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:08.040]   notice what God says next, verse 2. "But your iniquities have separated you from
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:14.960]   God. Your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear." Hang on a
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.880]   sec. So God starts out by saying, "I'm here for you. My might is safe. My arm is
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.800]   here. Not too short. I can hear you. I'm with you. I'm for you. You've got a great
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.160]   future. I don't want you to miss out on it." God starts with such a positive thing,
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.040]   but then he talks about the reality of what has happened through their sin. He
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.840]   says, "Your sin has separated you from me." In fact, he says it more specifically. He
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.000]   said, and it's quite important how he says it here, he says, "Your sins have
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.480]   hidden his face from you." It's a very important thing. There's this concept of
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:54.480]   a hiddenness. Your sin has hidden his face. I want you to see something right
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:01.320]   up front here. It does not say, "God has hidden his face from you." Come on, church.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:08.920]   It says, "Your sin has hidden his face from you." In other words, his face is
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:15.000]   right there. His face hasn't been removed. He is present with you right there. He's
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   still for you. He's not against you. Your sin, however, your sin has infected this
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.160]   relationship, and mostly, this is how it's described, it has hidden you, blinded you.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:33.640]   You're not able to see him in the way that he has actually designed you to see
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:39.080]   him. That's the great travesty of sin. Not that it removes God from us, but it
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:48.720]   removes us from God. We cannot see him as he desires for us to see him. To
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.280]   understand the power of that hiddenness, I want to actually just go a bit broader
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:58.520]   in Scripture beyond just Isaiah 59. I want to take you quickly to a part of, I
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.520]   think, what is the predominant place in Scripture theologically where it speaks
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.400]   about sin. This is Paul and Romans chapter 1. We're going to
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.880]   kind of go down into this chapter because I want to unpack a few things
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:15.360]   about the basic idea of sin, and then I want to apply that back to Isaiah 59
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.480]   verse 2. Is that alright? Can everybody do that? I know it's 11 o'clock. We're
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.200]   going to keep moving together. Alright, so here it is. I want you to see how Paul
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:29.920]   presents the reality of the travesty of sin so that we can understand what it
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:35.280]   does to us. Verse 18 of Romans chapter 1. "The anger of God is revealed from heaven
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:41.320]   against all godliness and wickedness of people who suppress the truth by their
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.120]   wickedness." Paul is writing here, and in fact he's going to go on, I'll show you
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.560]   in a moment. He's writing here about Adam and Eve. He's talking about Genesis 3, and
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.880]   he's trying to help his church understand what the travesty of Genesis
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:58.600]   3 has done for them, what it has done for all humanity, for God's people. And he
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   said there's this wickedness, there's this callousness in us, and he says here
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.280]   really importantly, he says it has suppressed the truth by their wickedness.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:14.000]   The first thing Paul wants you to know about sin is that sin suppresses the
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.280]   truth about God. Now why is that important? It's important because in
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:24.880]   Genesis 3, when Satan shows up to Adam and Eve, he shows up and he says, "Hey, why
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.400]   did God say you shouldn't eat from this tree of the knowledge of good and evil?"
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.720]   And they're like, "Well, he just forbade us not to eat from that tree." And here's
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.000]   what Satan says. He says, "The reason why he doesn't want you to eat from it is
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.080]   because if you eat from it, you'll know the truth." Oh really? What's the truth?
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.120]   Oh, the truth is you're not just made in the image of God, but you actually are
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.920]   God. That you can be God. The truth that God is hiding from you is that you will
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   actually be God. You'll see the world like he does. If you just take of that
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.360]   fruit, you'll suddenly see things just like God. And Adam and Eve are tricked,
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.360]   they're deceived into eating a fruit, thinking that they will know more,
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:07.360]   thinking that they'll see more of the world, become more like God, and it is a
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:14.640]   trick. Sin does not give us more knowledge. It suppresses the truth. Sin
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:21.720]   does not allow us to be more open to the world. It actually closes us off from it.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.440]   This is the starting point of what Paul's trying to unpack to his church.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.800]   You need to understand that your knowledge of God, your understanding of
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.320]   him in your sin, is actually suppressed. It's not relief. It's not like you get to
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:41.440]   see him more, understand him more, know him more in your sin. Your sin hides, go
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:48.160]   back to 59 verse 2, your sin hides the truth. It doesn't show you the world as
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:56.120]   it is. Are you still with me? Now notice what Paul then says next in verse 21. He
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.040]   says, "For although they," speaking about Adam and Eve, "knew God, they neither
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:05.240]   glorified him as God, nor gave thanks to him. But their thinking became futile, and
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.920]   their foolish hearts were darkened." See this is very important. He says first
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:14.000]   step, we sin and it suppresses the knowledge of God. Second step, when the
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.600]   knowledge of God is suppressed in us, our thinking is impacted. We no longer think
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.240]   good things about God. We no longer want to honor him. We don't want to think good
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:30.160]   of him. We don't want to be grateful for him. Our thinking is repressed inside of
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.760]   us because the knowledge of God has been repressed. Repress the knowledge of God,
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.360]   then human beings will not be expressing that knowledge. What he's talking about
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.880]   here in in verse 21 is that we don't worship. Sin stops us from worshipping
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.520]   God because if you suppress the knowledge of God, where is the worship
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.480]   then coming from? If we're not seeing him, if we're not experiencing him, if we don't
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.080]   have the truth of him, where does our worship come from? We stop worshipping
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:03.440]   because our thinking has changed. Are you still with me? Now notice what he says
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:10.000]   here. He says, "And they've exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.680]   to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles." Here's the third
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.720]   thing that happens. First of all, you suppress the truth of God. Second of all,
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:25.120]   it stops you from worshipping. Third, sin doesn't just hate, it loves. In other
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.320]   words, it doesn't just reject, it attaches. What is it attached to? Something man-made.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.440]   See, your desire is to worship. It's the way you've been created. But if you've
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.640]   suppressed the knowledge of God in you, if that then has stopped you worshipping
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.040]   the right thing, you will end up worshipping the wrong thing. And that's
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.680]   what the enemy wants. He wants you to attach to the wrong thing. He wants you
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.400]   to be addicted to your pornography. He wants you to be an alcoholic. He wants
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.400]   you to worship money. He wants you to dedicate your life to your career at the
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.840]   expense of your family. These are things that the enemy wants for you. He wants
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:10.160]   you to worship what God does not want you to worship. And all of this is what
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   sin does. Now, I'm gonna summarize all of Paul's teaching here in one PowerPoint
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.840]   slide that you can take a photo of and put on your fridge. Are you ready? Here it
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:26.180]   is. Sin hates the truth of God, suppresses it, and exchanges it for what
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:30.380]   sin loves and worships. Sin loves to worship and serve the created, not the
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:35.680]   creator. In all of us sits the reality of this exchange and the brokenness it
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:42.840]   creates in us. That's Paul, Romans 1, helping you to understand the power of
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.760]   sin. Now, I want you to take all of that great theology and I want you to bring
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.640]   it right back practically to Isaiah 59 verse 2. Let me read it to you again. "But
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:59.280]   your sin has separated you from your God. Your sins have hidden his face from you."
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.840]   Do you hear it with fresh ears? Do you see it with different eyes? It's not like
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.040]   God has separated himself. It's not like God has gone, "Ew, mucky humanity that keeps on
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:15.080]   sinning. Get away." This is actually, "I'm here. I'm here. And I want you to see your
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.400]   future." And our sin is suppressing his knowledge. We're exchanging it for the
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.600]   worship of something else. And this was Israel's issue. What led them into exile
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.320]   in the first place was their idolatry. It was that they had given up worship of
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.240]   Yahweh and they changed it to worship of the other kind of ethnic religions
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   around them. And that exchange had upset God. That exchange had separated them
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.400]   from, not because God had given up on them, but because they could no longer
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:47.240]   see properly. God was hidden from them by their sin. Are you with me? Do you see the
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.960]   power of that? That's a powerful revelation for some of you in this room.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:29:01.800]   That God's right there looking at you and going, "You're awesome. I got a great
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:10.120]   future for you, but you can't see it. You can't even see me. You can't see me the way I
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:16.040]   want you to see me. The fullness of myself is right here for you. I want you
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.240]   to see me so that your life would be changed, so that you would know what it
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.320]   is that I've called you to do. If you could just see me, if you could catch a
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:33.800]   glimpse of me, but your sin has hidden my face from you." Israel begins to
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.520]   understand this. And Israel does the one powerful thing that we all need to do
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.680]   when God moves in this way. Let me show you this from Isaiah 59, verse 12 onwards.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:49.120]   They say this, "For our offenses, Lord, are many in your sight, and our sins testify
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:54.720]   against us. Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities." And
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.600]   then they give a list of them. "Rebellion and treachery against the Lord, turning
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.800]   our backs on our God, fomenting oppression and revolt, uttering
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:10.160]   lies our hearts have conceived. So justice is driven back, and
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.000]   righteousness stands at a distance. Truth has stumbled in the streets.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.600]   Honesty cannot enter. Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:26.320]   its prey." They come before God and they're like, "We've done this, not you. We, our sin,
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.000]   has built a barrier between us and you. We cannot see the new thing that you've
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.040]   announced. You've asked us, 'Can we perceive it?' We're saying, 'No, we can't, because
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.400]   there's this stuff in front of us. Let me list to you, Lord, the things that we know
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:44.000]   we've done.'" And they're doing that, not because God is making them, but
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   because they're like, "These are the walls between us. These are the veil, if you
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.720]   will, that is up between us. This is the murkiness that affects us. It is my porn
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.600]   addiction. It is my alcoholism. It is my lust for money. It is these things, and I
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:05.400]   acknowledge them to you, not because you're punishing me. I acknowledge them
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:11.640]   to you because you're going to set me free. I'm going to see you in a way that I've
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:18.440]   never seen you before, and that's what I want. That's what I want, to see you like
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:24.160]   I've never seen you before." Now, Israel understands, though, that they can't
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:30.920]   change anything. They understand that no behavioral modification is going to deal
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:38.360]   with this. They realize that this is no longer a surface issue. Local anesthetic
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:45.880]   is going to do nothing. And it's at this moment, when they acknowledge the reality
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:55.120]   that they're helpless, that God leans over to their ears and says, "Thallium?"
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:05.480]   And they're like, "Yes, please." I want you to notice this. God responds, "The Lord
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.920]   looked and was displeased that there was no justice." Notice this, the Lord did not
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.800]   look and was displeased at his people. He looked and displeased at the state that
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.960]   had been created through sin. No justice, no shalom. The poor were still being
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.840]   marginalized. Those that were on the outskirts were still being downtrodden.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.760]   There wasn't stuff happening that was his character in the world. He looked
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:31.360]   around and he was displeased that the world was not as it should be. He was
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.920]   sore that there was no one. He was appalled that there was no one to
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.680]   intervene. Notice this, he realized that there was no human that was going to be
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:44.000]   able to set this right. There was nobody to intervene. God himself would have to
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.400]   intervene. How does God intervene? He would send his son Jesus as a human,
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:54.320]   fully God and fully human, into the world. Why? Because sin is essentially a human
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.440]   issue, but it's only God that can deal with that issue. That's the incarnation
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.680]   in a nutshell. Fully God, fully human, because sin is a human issue and only
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:09.160]   God can actually deal with it. And so he says this, he said, "His own arm worked
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.200]   salvation for him. His own righteousness sustained him. He put on righteousness as
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.920]   the breastplate, the helmet of salvation on his head. He put on garments of
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.240]   vengeance and wrapped himself in a zeal as in a cloak. Those words should remind
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.640]   you of something. Paul later in Ephesians would write these exact same words,
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.960]   Pauling here from Isaiah 59. God does it now. Breastplate of righteousness, helmet
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.920]   of salvation. I'm gonna fight your battles. Paul later says, because of the
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.920]   death and resurrection of Jesus, we get to put this stuff on now. We get to
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.240]   protect ourselves against sin. We get to fight battles for each other. We can wear
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.520]   the helmet of salvation, the breastplate of righteousness. We can put the belt of
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.800]   truth around us because we will not suppress the truth anymore. But in this
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.920]   moment, God is doing those things on behalf of his people. Notice what he says
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.720]   in verse 20, "The Redeemer will come to Zion to those in Jacob who repent of
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.800]   their sin." Jesus is coming, basically, is what God is saying to Israel. And I don't
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.840]   want you to miss out. I don't want you not to see it. I want you to see the
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.840]   glory of Christ amongst you. He's just coming and if you repent of your sins, if
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:17.400]   you acknowledge the wall that's between you and me, the wall will come down. How?
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:25.320]   Look at how he says in verse 21, "As for me, this is my covenant for you. My spirit
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.360]   who is on you and my words that I have put in your mouth will not depart from
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.480]   your mouth or from the mouths of your children or from the mouths of their
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:39.440]   descendants from this time forever and ever, declares the Lord." God starts by
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:44.000]   saying, "I'm here for you. I'm mighty to save. I can fight your battles." He ends
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.080]   by saying, "I'm gonna put my spirit in you and my spirit is gonna so regenerate
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.920]   you that my word will not depart, not just your mouth, but your family's mouth
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.440]   and the generations after it and the generations after that and the
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.960]   generations after that. I'm gonna do something through the life, death, and
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.120]   resurrection of Jesus that is gonna change all of eternity. That if you're in
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:08.280]   that relationship, you're in that relationship forever. It'll be for the
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.280]   glory of you. I'm not giving you some local anesthetic. I'm regenerating you
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:18.560]   from the inside out by my spirit and by the word." So see what God is doing in the
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.680]   chapter here. It starts out by saying, "I've got you. I'm mighty to save, but your
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:29.720]   sin blocks your vision of me." Wow, God, I understand that. I see that. I don't want
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.560]   my vision of you to be blocked. Lord, here are the things that I know are blocking
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:38.720]   you. Would you forgive me? I'm pouring my spirit on you. I've got my word for you.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.080]   I'm regenerating you and your family for generation after generation after
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:50.440]   generation. I got you. So sin isn't this really dark thing. I mean, the
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:54.040]   consequences of it, the reality of what it does in our relationship with God. Dark, hard,
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:36:02.680]   bitter things. But God's attitude and approach is, "I've got you." So let me draw
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:08.320]   us to a close with one quick and final demonstration to you of all that I think
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.000]   God is saying through Isaiah. And I think this will really help you to understand
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.920]   how you should approach all of this in your life. This is the practical way you
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.840]   can put this into place. It starts out by knowing that God created humanity good.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.240]   In fact, humanity is described as very good. And actually Genesis 1 and 2 shows
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:32.560]   us a picture where people are able, Adam and Eve, to see God without anything
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:38.000]   blocking him at all. The word used is, "They were naked and unashamed." Nothing
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.840]   between them and God. Nothing between them either. They had this total
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:47.280]   transparency, vulnerability, and openness before God. That's how we started. That's
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.640]   the relationship in which we should have with God. That's the way things ought to
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:59.600]   be. And then Genesis 3 takes place. And in Genesis 3, things get entered into what
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.260]   it is that God has created in us. What are some of those things that I think we
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.960]   deal with? Well, let me give you some examples. I think one would be
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.400]   self-righteousness. I think us Christians are really good with
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:16.600]   self-righteousness. See, self-righteousness is represented here by select vinegar
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:24.160]   because it looks a lot like how we were intended to be, but it really, really
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:31.160]   stinks. Self-righteousness is not the way Christ has created you to be, even
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.040]   though you can come and pretend that everything is okay when actually it
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.440]   stinks. What about things like anger that I know many of us deal with?
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:44.760]   Bitterness. That has to be represented by Tabasco, surely. And that comes into us,
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.880]   doesn't it? And we find it really hard to shake our bitterness and our anger at
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:55.800]   one another. It stores up inside of us, and it stores up deep inside of us so
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.720]   that it bubbles up at the most inconvenient of times. What about things
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.480]   like we talked about earlier, fear and anxiety and worry? I think a twining
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:11.680]   teabag is a good way to think about your worries. Why? Because we dip in and out of
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.840]   our worries on a constant basis, don't we? Just like a teabag in a cup of tea. And
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.520]   as we dip into our worries and as we leave it in there, they just begin to
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:26.040]   soak and begin to slowly spread and cover everything. What about something
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.480]   like envy? This is something we struggle with in Hong Kong a lot. "Oh, they got a
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.160]   better car than me. Oh, they live in a better place than I do. Oh, their job is
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.960]   better than mine. I want everything they have." I think that's best represented
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:42.920]   here by lime syrup because it is incredibly sour. Imagine what it would be
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:48.560]   like to go around envious of people all the time, very sour towards them, aren't
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:55.320]   we? What about this? What about our gossip? Gossip is represented here by Nescafe
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:02.680]   coffee. Now, here's the reason why. Because gossip is something everyone is doing
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:10.440]   but it really isn't good for us. And it's really at work in us. You're all drug
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:18.880]   addicts. How about our secret sin? This one's for us Asians, myself included. This
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:24.160]   is soy sauce but it represents our secret sins because soy sauce is the
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.600]   little condiment you have on the side. It's not the main dish. It's like kind of
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.240]   over there but if you dip your thing in there it actually taints everything,
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:39.560]   right? Look at the color. Look at the way in which it gets absolutely everywhere.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:45.440]   Now, here is exactly what I think God is saying through Isaiah to Israel and what
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:51.160]   he's saying to us today. He said, "Your sin blocks you from being able to see me.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:59.720]   Your sin hides my face from you. You cannot see me anymore." Let me show you.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:19.080]   That's biblical revelations. I spit you out of my mouth. Oh man, that's bad. Sin
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:24.440]   does not taste good. At the end of the 915 somebody came up to me and said, "I got a
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.800]   name for your cocktail." I'm like, "Oh really? What is it?" He's like, "Sin in the city." I'm
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:38.920]   like, "There you go." But this is what God's saying. Your sin hides my face from you.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.360]   It's not my face that's taken from you. You just can't see me the way it is. And what
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.660]   Paul says in Romans is we need to be regenerated by Christ. We need to know
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:51.280]   that Christ fights those battles for us. That he regenerates us inside out. That he
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.760]   pours his Spirit over us at the end of Isaiah 59. That the Spirit pours over us.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.640]   And as the Spirit pours over us, everything is able to change. So let's
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:06.120]   take God's Spirit and as we begin to allow it to change us, to renew us, to
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:13.800]   move on us, look what it actually does inside of us. It completely changes us.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:21.880]   Now, not until Christ returns are we completely renewed in him. But now we
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:26.640]   live in this tension of now but not yet. Paul would describe it in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:34.440]   He would say, "It's like I see through a glass almost dimly." But guess what?
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:44.160]   That tastes an awful lot better. Your sin hides God's face from you. But your
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.240]   response is to simply allow him to pour his love into you. To pour his
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:53.320]   forgiveness and his grace over and over again into you. To fill you again with
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:57.440]   his love. So that the things that are there that no local anesthetics ever
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.040]   going to deal with is going to be able to be purged and cleansed for you for
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.760]   the glory of God. If you want to see the new thing that God is doing in 2023 in
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.680]   your life, it's gonna require you getting rid of your expectations. It's gonna
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:15.000]   require you moving towards those within which he's working. And it's also gonna
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:22.960]   require you to deal with the very thing that hides God's face from you. And we do
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.640]   that through the forgiveness that comes from acknowledging our sin before Jesus
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:35.880]   and enabling him to wash us again. Valium, Holy Spirit, he's here for you and he
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.680]   will set you free. If you'd like me to pray for you on that, would you stand
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.840]   with me? I want to pray.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:49.440]   And if you'd like to respond today, just open your hands. And if you're online
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.760]   right now, you can do the same as well wherever you're watching. Just open your
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:59.280]   hands before the Lord. Father, we come before you today, your people, your chosen
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:06.360]   people. People who you declare over that my arm is not too short to save, my ears
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:15.120]   not deaf to these ones. But Father, we recognize our glass is dark. We
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.560]   recognize, Lord, that we add and add at times.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:24.680]   And that our sin hides your face from us.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:30.440]   And so, Father, we come with open hands before you this morning and the positive
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:36.600]   idea that there's a great future just ahead. That when you come back, as
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:41.320]   Revelation 21 and 22 would describe, the new Jerusalem, that tree of the knowledge
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.840]   of good and evil is no longer in the garden. That there's no more pain, no more
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.640]   sickness, no more death, no more sin. That we are now fully with you, completely
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:56.680]   like it was at the beginning of all things. But in this moment, as we see
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:04.400]   through a glass dimly, let us see. May we see you in a way that we haven't seen
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:10.360]   you before. Lord, we come to you asking for your cleansing that is only possible
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.840]   through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. No man was able to do this. So
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:21.800]   we come to you with the incarnation of Christ, fully God, fully human, who took
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.680]   our sins, bore our iniquities on that cross, paid the price for what it is that
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:31.960]   we had done. Who rose again to say that sin does not have the final word, that
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:36.760]   death is not the full stop, merely a comma. That you would open up for us a
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.840]   new life, a life of abundance and love. That the enemy came to kill and destroy,
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:45.600]   but I came to give life and life abundant. Lord, I pray over every person
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.920]   here whose hands are open before you, that you now would bring your
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:53.800]   regenerating spirit of love. That they would feel you like they have never felt
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.200]   you before, and they would see your face like they have never seen you before.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:06.480]   Father, I pray for a releasing. I pray a releasing from the things that blind us,
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.440]   from seeing you the way that you created us to see you. And Lord, we open
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:18.000]   ourselves to a new future. Father, we declare as Isaiah 43 did, that you are
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.040]   doing a new thing. Now it springs up. Will we perceive it?
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:30.760]   I want you to take some time as your hands are open before the Lord. Just
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:37.840]   allow the Holy Spirit to bring to mind maybe the one thing today that is part
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:43.880]   of that blockage, that is part of the blinding, that makes your glass dark and
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:49.720]   difficult to see through. That one thing that the Holy Spirit is bringing to mind
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:55.360]   for you right now. It'll be different, of course, for all of us. And as you bring
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:02.760]   that to Him, do as Israel does in the chapter. Just acknowledge. Ask for His
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:07.840]   forgiveness in that one area. Will I bring this thing to you? I acknowledge
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.360]   that it is not of you. And I ask now that you would change me.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.000]   Would you forgive me?
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.720]   And in that, His promise is that you have a Redeemer. That His Spirit and His Word
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:31.440]   will not depart from you. God declared that as a covenant over His people. And if you
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:40.880]   honestly bring your brokenness to Him, He forgives and restores and renews. And the
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:49.400]   sin that so easily entangles is release in the name of Jesus. And Lord, it's in
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.560]   the freedom of being released that we now get to move forward in Hong Kong,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.040]   move forward in our workplaces, move forward in our families, move forward in
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.640]   the social networks that we have, move forward in the relationships in our
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:06.560]   lives. Lord, it is in the freedom that comes through the regeneration of your
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:13.440]   spirit to our brokenness that we find new life. Lord, I pray that everybody here
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:20.000]   would go forward in hope and joy. In Jesus' name.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.760]   Let's continue to worship.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.340]   (upbeat music)
