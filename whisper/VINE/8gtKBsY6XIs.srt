1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 So a few days ago I was in a Chinese restaurant and I had the most exuberant waiter you could

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,840
 ever imagine.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,680
 Every time I ordered anything his reply was, "Why not?"

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,160
 Which I thought was quite funny.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,200
 "Can I have a Coke?"

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
 "Why not?"

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,440
 "I'd like some more fried rice, please."

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
 "Why not?"

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,440
 "Where's the bathroom?"

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,120
 "Why not?"

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,560
 But he was so full of life and literally his answer to everything was, "Why not?"

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,080
 With a big smile on his face.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,080
 As we were just worshipping and singing those words, "I magnify you, Lord."

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,360
 And as I think about the start of this new year of the rabbit, the first day of the Chinese

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,600
 New Year, I hear God leaning over you and saying, "Why not?"

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,720
 Why not this year?

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,260
 Why not in this moment?

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,420
 Why not those dreams that you've held on your hearts for so long?

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,040
 Why not that thing that you were wanting to start, maybe a business or an idea?

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,120
 I feel like we're stepping into a season of harvest.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,160
 I feel like we're stepping into a season of opportunity.

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,400
 And I feel like the Holy Spirit is saying over the vine, "Why not?"

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,160
 We're planting a church this year in Yuen Long at a time when the economy is not great,

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,440
 it's an expensive thing to do.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,680
 And God says, "Why not?"

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,960
 Whatever it is that's going on in your heart and your life right now where there are challenges

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,040
 for you or there's even just a sense of fear of holding back, a sense of like, "I don't

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
 know, it's a risk.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,200
 I feel like I'm going to take a risk."

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,360
 And I feel like the Lord is just wanting to release you from fear, release you from anxiety,

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,040
 and say that this year is a year of opportunity for you.

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,480
 It doesn't mean, it's very important, it doesn't mean that everything's going to work out perfectly.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,560
 The Christian life is not a life where God is a Santa Claus who waves a magic wand and

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,920
 suddenly our lives are perfect.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,200
 If you've been a Christian for a long time, you'll know that that's not the way it works.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,160
 But we have a God who meets us in the highs and the lows.

37
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,000
 We have a God who says, "Forget the former things, for a new thing is at work.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,680
 And I will announce it to you before you see it spring up."

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,400
 That's that passage I read to us just before we started worshiping.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,200
 I will announce it to you before it springs up.

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,800
 The why not attitude is one where God comes and announces things to us before he has actually

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,360
 done them.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
 This is your year.

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
 This is going to happen.

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,520
 This is going to take place.

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,880
 Have some courage.

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
 Take some risk.

48
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,520
 Step out in faith.

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,200
 I've got you.

50
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
 Why not?

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,600
 If you'd like to receive just a little bit of that today, I wonder if you just open your

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
 hands.

53
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
 I want to pray for us.

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,960
 Father, I thank you so much for the men and women in this room, for the children here,

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,360
 for young and old alike.

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,080
 We thank you for the start of this new year, a year of this beautiful idea of this longevity

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,960
 and peace and tranquility and hope.

58
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,120
 Lord, I believe that this is a year of opportunity for people in this room and those watching

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
 online right now.

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,480
 I believe this is a why not kind of year.

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,400
 And Lord, I pray the same exuberance I had from that waiter would be the same exuberance

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,360
 that they sense the Spirit of God working in their lives this year.

63
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,760
 Saying hey, step out in faith.

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,840
 Take that step of courage.

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
 Why not?

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
 Why not?

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
 Why not?

68
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
 I'm your God.

69
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,640
 I'm with you and I am for you.

70
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,400
 Nothing can be against you.

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,720
 And so Lord, I pray for those in this room where they're in a bit of a tough spot, where

72
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,640
 things are a bit hard right now.

73
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,760
 Lord, I want to pray that your Spirit of hope would come.

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,920
 I pray that today they would be able to lift their eyes a little bit higher to where their

75
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
 hope comes from.

76
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,320
 And Lord, for those of us in this room that are longing for new things, maybe those of

77
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,520
 us in this room who are sensing a passion for something but not sure what the first

78
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,120
 step is, sensing a calling out of God but not sure how to activate that in their lives.

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,920
 So Lord, I pray that they would feel the wind of your Spirit moving them forward today,

80
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
 Lord.

81
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,840
 And Father, we thank you that at the beginning of a new year, we can forget the former things,

82
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,880
 that we can step into this hope that you have provided for us.

83
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,560
 And Lord, I want to pray for everyone here that 2023 would be a year where you speak

84
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,520
 things over them before they spring up.

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,360
 That they would have the courage to do things because you have spoken over them, even before

86
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,640
 they've seen the impact of that in the physical.

87
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,000
 That they would know that God is saying something to them in a spiritual that would actually

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
 enliven their hearts to take whatever step it is that needs to be taken in the physical.

89
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,520
 Lord, we thank you that you're like that.

90
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,880
 And Lord, we just commit our hearts to this.

91
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,240
 For you love this city of Hong Kong and you, Lord, are for this city, Lord.

92
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,480
 Fill us with hope, with joy, and may this year be a year of the why not.

93
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,400
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

94
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
 Everyone says amen.

95
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,440
 Can we thank the worship team because they're amazing and we love them and they're awesome

96
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
 and they're dressed in red.

97
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,320
 As you sit down, why don't you say hi to someone?

98
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,000
 Say, "Hey, wow, nice to meet you.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Who are you?

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,400
 I don't know you.

101
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,320
 You seem like a nice person.

102
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
 Be friendly.

103
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
 So good."

104
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,600
 Well, Sunday at Firelock, again, it's so great to be with you guys here on Chinese New Year,

105
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,560
 the actual first day of Chinese New Year.

106
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,360
 If you've been fasting, we break our fast today, which is a wonderful thing.

107
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
 And we are so glad you're here.

108
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,280
 And I'm excited because we're doing a one-off message today as we celebrate the reality

109
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,440
 of Chinese New Year.

110
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,640
 And the chairman of our elders, Sydney Yip, is coming.

111
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,720
 Can we put our hands together for Sydney?

112
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,760
 I just want you to know how good-looking Sydney and I are today, wearing matching outfits

113
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,880
 that we did not coordinate, did we?

114
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
 I don't know.

115
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
 We...

116
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
 Coordinated in spirit.

117
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
 Coordinated in spirit.

118
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
 That is absolutely right.

119
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
 Beautiful thing.

120
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
 Would you stretch out your hands?

121
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
 We're going to pray for Sydney.

122
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,880
 Father, thank you for this man.

123
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,600
 Lord, I have the rare privilege of seeing this man lead publicly like he will do today,

124
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,880
 but more often lead privately, behind the scenes as the chairman of our eldership, serving

125
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,360
 this church faithfully, putting in hours that many people don't know about, sacrificing,

126
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,640
 doing the hard meetings as well as the good ones.

127
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,480
 Lord, I really honor this man of faith.

128
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,160
 And Father, I pray that as he opens up this passage, which really speaks a lot about his

129
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,320
 own experience, Lord, that you would open our hearts.

130
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,120
 Lord, we don't want the seed of your Word to fall on hardened ground.

131
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,320
 So here at the start of this new year, would you just come and open our hearts to you.

132
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,720
 And we thank you for this, in Jesus' name.

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 Everyone says, "Amen."

134
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
 Amen.

135
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,840
 Thank you, Andrew.

136
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,360
 When Jesus was about to ascend to heaven, he spoke about the coming kingdom.

137
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:26,080
 So what he said was, "It is not for you to know the time or seasons that the Father has

138
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,880
 fixed by his own authority."

139
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,320
 So happy Chinese New Year once again.

140
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:38,440
 I believe many of you are unprepared as much as I was in the transition of Christmas to

141
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,040
 New Year, and now it's Chinese New Year.

142
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,840
 So it's a lot got to do with timing, and especially for the Chinese New Year.

143
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,400
 Even for the flowers that we bought for the Chinese New Year, you need the timing, and

144
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,200
 you need the timing right.

145
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,240
 So like a daffodil that we have nicely here, well, you have to buy it at the right time.

146
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,520
 You have to trim it.

147
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
 You have to warm it.

148
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,200
 You have to shine it.

149
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,640
 And then along the way, you notice that, well, fragrance is coming.

150
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,320
 The bud of the flower is there.

151
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:16,240
 And then, well, for all you know, along the way, there are more blossoms and more fragrance.

152
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,800
 And well, the best is if it opens up in full blossom on a New Year's Day.

153
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200
 So that's about season.

154
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:33,380
 As much as flowers is for seasons, we all go through different seasons in life.

155
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,120
 So I would like to take this opportunity to share something about times and seasons on

156
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,720
 this very special day.

157
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:49,240
 Well, I guess I am privileged, and I'm seasoned enough in terms of age, to reflect on this

158
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,640
 subject.

159
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,640
 I want to start by sharing a very short story by none other than Toh Kien.

160
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:04,720
 Well, he was in a kind of impasse, basically was stuck while writing up his masterpiece,

161
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
 The Lord of the Rings.

162
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,400
 So he was very worried and concerned that he won't be able to finish the piece.

163
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,200
 So the title is Leaf by Nego.

164
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
 So Nego is an artist.

165
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
 He's a painter.

166
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,020
 He had this vision of drawing a really, really beautiful tree at the countryside.

167
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,480
 So he started with drawing a leaf.

168
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,960
 He spent a lot of time making sure that that very leaf was really great, beautiful, magnificent.

169
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,200
 But he was also very stuck.

170
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,400
 He had a lot of mundane that he needed to deal with.

171
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,960
 And to add on to all this, his neighbor by the name of Parrish always sought for his

172
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,040
 help at unwarranted time.

173
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,960
 And this Parrish wife even fell sick needing the care of Nego.

174
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,000
 And also on Nego's heart, he has some concerns because he has a journey that he needs to

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,400
 make, which he was really reluctant to go forth.

176
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:20,480
 Well, he fell sick after taking care of Parrish's wife, and he departed.

177
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:28,520
 So all that he was left was that canvas of one small leaf.

178
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:35,000
 Well, it was beautiful, but after the storm that ruined his house, that leaf was finally

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,480
 retrieved to be put up in a museum, where sadly, very few people really visited.

180
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,000
 Now as Nego journeyed on, he arrived at the countryside.

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,560
 And lo and behold, he saw the very tree that he had envisaged to paint and draw.

182
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,320
 So there stood the magnificent tree in the countryside.

183
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,520
 And he even met his neighbor, Parrish.

184
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,760
 And there he find much comfort.

185
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,840
 So after writing this short story, Tolkien find his own comfort.

186
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:21,480
 He was able to gather further strength to finish his masterpiece, Lord of the Rings.

187
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,080
 I find much comfort in reading this story.

188
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:33,720
 The thing is, well, what we are doing on earth, which could be a very, very small representation

189
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:44,240
 of the magnificence, the tree, the countryside that God had ordained for us, we may be representing

190
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,560
 or doing a small token to appreciate or to reflect on the glory of the things that God

191
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:03,360
 had in mind and will future be fulfilled in due time.

192
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,160
 What we did on earth had a bearing even in the heavenly.

193
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,040
 Now do you remember when Jesus resurrected from death, he showed his lone scar to Thomas.

194
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,400
 So what was inflected on earth had a heavenly bearing.

195
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,800
 So as a surgeon, I was always reminded, whatever wound that I inflect on my patients, that

196
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:34,720
 would leave a scar and the scar would last a real long time.

197
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,000
 So whatever we did, there is a heavenly bearing.

198
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,400
 Our earthly work could amount to the heavenly good.

199
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,280
 What was done on earth indeed carries a marking all the way to the heavens.

200
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,680
 Our earthly work could amount to heavenly good.

201
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,240
 By the way, while it could be incidental, it could be divine.

202
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,040
 My family name is none other than Yip.

203
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,280
 So whenever I was greeted in the corridor, in the ward, in the OR, while I was actually

204
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:19,080
 reminded that, well, what I was doing is to paint my leaf and the leaf should bring glory

205
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:25,040
 to God, I spent much time going through my half-time transition.

206
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,840
 That process included relocation back to Singapore from, I mean, from Singapore to Hong Kong

207
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,520
 to work in an academic medical center.

208
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,480
 I felt it was God's hands guiding.

209
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,700
 And about the time of the finish of my contract, I made some renewed commitments to God and

210
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:52,760
 to myself that I would strive even better in my career, in my vocation.

211
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,500
 But then I was not offered a new contract.

212
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,480
 That was my winter season.

213
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:08,520
 My personal ambition to be the best in my field, to build up the strongest team, somehow

214
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
 vanished.

215
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:17,680
 Now, today, I want to share with you how this turning around season will show that God has

216
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,600
 purposefully put changing seasons in a year to remind us of the changing seasons in life.

217
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,560
 Now, this few weeks, we have been dwelling on Isaiah, which really talks about how God

218
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,800
 bring new things in the world in critical moments of history.

219
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,920
 Now I shall refer to yet another prophet, Jeremiah.

220
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,340
 Jeremiah wrote at around time of Jerusalem's fall.

221
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:52,480
 And then from there, we'll reflect on the turning points in history as well as in life.

222
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,960
 Now as mentioned, Jeremiah was writing at around the time of the fall of Jerusalem to

223
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
 Babylon.

224
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,920
 Yet, he was pointing forward to the new covenant.

225
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,360
 After 70 years of exile, that a new covenant of God will be fulfilled, and he was writing

226
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
 to the exiles.

227
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,520
 Now, according to some scholars, Jerusalem was actually besieged in the winter times.

228
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,320
 And winter, even in the Middle East, in Israel, could be tough, it could be cold, it's rainy,

229
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,240
 and it could be most challenging for the besieged city.

230
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,120
 And somehow, yet, the most familiar verse we have in Jeremiah is probably chapter 29,

231
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,320
 verse 11.

232
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:45,120
 "For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, and plans

233
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
 to give you a hope and a future."

234
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:54,640
 Wow, do we knowing or unknowingly take the verses outside of its context?

235
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,920
 We always embrace the new hope.

236
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:04,040
 And yet, while Jeremiah was writing, it was in a season of dark winter.

237
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,800
 How are these promises going to sink into their real world at that point in time?

238
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,360
 And furthermore, Jeremiah actually, against all conventional wisdom, he recognized a different

239
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:24,080
 reality and proceeded to purchase a piece of land when the city was besieged.

240
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:31,280
 So it was recorded that he bought a piece of field at Annabas from his cousin and weighed

241
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,800
 out for him 70 shekels of silver.

242
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,280
 He signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out on the silver of the scales.

243
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,480
 But at that point, the piece of land is already under Babylon's control.

244
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,960
 And it seems an act of folly to purchase a property that would be lost forever.

245
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,280
 Yet, Jeremiah sees a different reality.

246
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,240
 The word of the Lord, he bought the property, have it witnessed, and went through all the

247
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,160
 needed legal deals.

248
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,360
 Jeremiah was purchasing a piece of land as an act of prophecy.

249
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,920
 Now there is tremendous theology significance attached to land.

250
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:27,640
 Land is a promise and a gift from God, Yahweh, to both Abraham and the entire Israel nation.

251
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:38,240
 And now the Lord is declaring via Jeremiah that while everything seems hopeless, hope

252
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,480
 begins to be a strength of all.

253
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,200
 Shall we call this hope against all odds?

254
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:54,640
 In fact, Jeremiah further on says on behalf of God that he will surely gather them from

255
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
 all the lands.

256
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,120
 He will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.

257
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,640
 They will be my people and I will be their God.

258
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,800
 How should we understand God's promises and timing of fulfillment via the lands of changing

259
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
 seasons?

260
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:21,440
 That indeed, all things are made beautiful in His time.

261
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,120
 As we reflect on the winter season and the spring seasons, we appreciate even more the

262
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,120
 significance of the turning of seasons.

263
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,760
 So let's start with winter.

264
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,320
 Well winter here is pretty moderate.

265
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,600
 But when you think of winter, you think of your skiing trip in Japan.

266
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,440
 That does not count as holiday.

267
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,280
 Well but in real natural life, winter is a season of decline.

268
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:59,320
 The days grow shorter, the lights are dimmer, summer's abundance and winter's colors began

269
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,100
 to fade.

270
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,760
 Everything decayed and now there's a monocony, a sense of impending loss sets in.

271
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:16,440
 Well I must confess I'm a very sentimental person and I am very pessimistic overall.

272
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,000
 I tend to be drawn deeply by the prospect of death rather than lifted by the hope of

273
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 new life.

274
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,720
 In fact, death victory can sometimes seem supreme.

275
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,780
 It was only last month, I mean last March, that we witnessed the horrendous hay walk

276
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,280
 that was inflected on the local population including the elderly.

277
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,840
 How shall we come out of this downward spiral?

278
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,960
 Now in the Midwest, in US, where I spent some of my time doing my training, newcomers were

279
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,520
 given this piece of advice during the winter time.

280
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:03,400
 The winters will drive you crazy until you learn to get out into them.

281
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:11,200
 So there the people would buy decent clothing, warm, so that they can get outdoors and avoid

282
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,560
 the cabin fever that otherwise will arise if they continue to huddle fearfully by the

283
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,600
 fire during the hot frozen winters.

284
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,920
 Essentially, we learned that a daily walk into the winter world would fortify the spirit

285
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:33,720
 within us by taking us boldly to the very heart of the season.

286
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:41,400
 Well the coldest winter that I ever experienced was when I did my medical student internship

287
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,240
 in Toronto.

288
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,880
 So where, while I was living in Chinatown as a poor medical student, I have to walk

289
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,320
 about 20, 30 minutes all the way to Toronto General Hospital and Sick Kids Children's

290
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,600
 Hospital for some of you who know the place.

291
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:06,280
 So in a deep winter, the cleaners would prepare the road at around 5, 5.30, clean up the road,

292
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,920
 but they pile up all the snow to the pedestrian walk.

293
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,360
 So I would be literally walking through four or five feet of snow all piled up so that

294
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,280
 I can reach the hospital.

295
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:24,320
 But there's no point waiting for the bus because you will get frozen before the bus arrives.

296
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,560
 But the good thing about this daily walk at 6 o'clock when light is just beginning to

297
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,800
 dawn is it is exactly that you walk into the winter, you train, you fortify your spirit.

298
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,880
 And I was actually thankful because that daily walk helped me consolidate my desire to be

299
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,440
 trained as a surgeon, to be resilient.

300
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,600
 Well but at the same time, God is gracious.

301
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,120
 It can be really cold.

302
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,760
 It could be minus 20 or minus 30 in Toronto.

303
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:05,440
 So for the coldest winter day that year, I was actually on duty in the hospital.

304
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,160
 So what happens is I'm warm, I'm safe, and I don't have to wake up early next morning

305
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,480
 to walk that walk through the winter.

306
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,240
 While a lot of my seniors and other staff could not make it because the snowfall had

307
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,280
 blocked all the major highways.

308
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,560
 So I really, really impressed my boss when I appear early in the morning before everybody

309
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,120
 else.

310
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,400
 While winter, other than reminding us that there are times of dormancy and deep rest,

311
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,920
 and they're essential to all living things, we are also to acknowledge that ultimately

312
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,200
 in those winters, God is our refuge.

313
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,760
 The past years have been a long winter for many of us in this congregation.

314
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,640
 In fact, our inner winters can take many forms.

315
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:09,800
 Failure, losses, depression, separation from family, or even death.

316
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,440
 But every one of them yields the same advice.

317
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:22,280
 The winters will drive us crazy until we learn to get out into them.

318
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,960
 Until we enter boldly into the fears that we most want to avoid, those fears will dominate

319
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,640
 our lives.

320
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,760
 But when we walk boldly and directly into them, of course protected by the warmth from

321
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,040
 the community of your faith community, and the guidance from the Holy Spirit, we can

322
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,720
 learn what winter got to teach us.

323
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:54,680
 Then we discover once again the cycle of seasons is trustworthy and life-giving, even in the

324
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,560
 most dismaying season of all.

325
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:05,960
 That I got the diagnosis of leukemia was winter to me.

326
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:14,480
 What I chose to start treatment was my walking into the winters.

327
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:21,320
 Well as I've shared, I'm easily fixated on surface appearances, on the decline of meaning,

328
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:27,280
 the decay of relationships, the death of a work, an ambition.

329
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:35,440
 And yet as I look more deeply, I can see that there are possibilities being planted to bear

330
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,600
 fruit in some seasons yet to come.

331
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:51,920
 Even Jeremiah shared in lamentation, "Because of the lost great love, we are not consumed.

332
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,760
 For my compassions never fail.

333
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,760
 They are new every morning."

334
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,320
 Great is your faithfulness.

335
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,360
 Yeah, indeed great is God's faithfulness.

336
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,360
 So in retrospect, I can see that in my own life, I could not see the things that I could

337
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,160
 not see at that particular time point.

338
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:22,080
 How the job that I lost, that left me in dismay, actually helped me find work that I really

339
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,120
 needed to do.

340
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:32,960
 How the road closure turned me towards terrain that would otherwise not travel.

341
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:41,680
 How losses that I feel so irredeemable forced me to find new meanings.

342
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:49,400
 On the surface, it may seem that life was lessening, but silently and lavishly, the

343
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,520
 seeds of new life were always being sown.

344
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:02,080
 As I moved into private practice, I actually learned this verse all over again, "Forget

345
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,360
 the former things, embrace the new."

346
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,000
 I could be practicing in a different setting, but I can still offer my best for the very

347
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,520
 patients that God entrusted us.

348
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:23,280
 And I'm confident and glad to say the department also moved into even higher grounds.

349
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:32,640
 Now new opportunity arise also as I roll into seminary studies as a part-time old student.

350
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,800
 I guess I was the oldest in the class.

351
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,720
 Anyway, it was a dream come true.

352
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,960
 A dream that I turned down some 35 years ago when I had my first calling to enter into

353
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,120
 seminary studies.

354
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,520
 So it's a dream come true and I was given a second chance.

355
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:01,960
 Now the mere joy of knowing, of knowing him better and the opportunity to share my limited

356
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:08,440
 understanding are by themselves a tremendous blessing for me.

357
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,320
 Even Jeremiah shared, "They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion.

358
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:22,520
 They will rejoice in the bounty of the Lord, the grain, the olives, and the new wine.

359
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,680
 They will be like a well-watered garden and they will sorrow no more."

360
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,840
 Even more importantly, it's not about renewed material blessings.

361
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,680
 Jeremiah is talking about a new heart, a new heart for the new season.

362
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,600
 This is the covenant I will make, says the Lord.

363
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,480
 I will put new laws in their minds and write it in their hearts.

364
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,440
 I will be their God and they will be my people.

365
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,000
 And you know, all these promises are laid at the harsh winter for the besieged Israelites.

366
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,840
 Yet they are fulfilled in due time.

367
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,640
 If not for the war, the winter is kind of a preparatory season for spring.

368
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,280
 It's rainy and it prepares the land.

369
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,400
 Even the Song of Songs talked about this.

370
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,480
 "See, the winter is past.

371
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,120
 The rains are over and gone.

372
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,720
 Flowers appear on the earth.

373
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:35,000
 The season of singing has come.

374
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,680
 The calling of those is heard in our land."

375
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,720
 A new song.

376
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,360
 Well, spring comes slowly and tentatively, but it grows with a tenacity.

377
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,680
 I still remember that year while myself and the whole family was doing my training in

378
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,960
 St. Louis.

379
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:00,560
 That winter creeps very much into April and we were, as a family, a little bit depressed

380
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,240
 with the long winter.

381
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,040
 So as I tried to bring my kids to venture out a little bit, one odd day we suddenly

382
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:16,560
 realized that they are the smallest, the most tender shoots, began to find their way.

383
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:25,840
 They have insisted to have their way coming out through grounds that once was deemed barren.

384
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,160
 Those very small sprouts of life, of green leaves, are always a glimpse, a high binger

385
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,720
 of hope.

386
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,640
 And from those very, very small beginnings, hope grows at a geometric rate.

387
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:51,900
 The days get longer, the winds get warmer, and the world grows green again.

388
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:58,800
 As I shared early on while I studied in the seminary, in the midst of my own medical condition,

389
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,320
 the fallout of my business partnership, and of course, the COVID season, I was wondering

390
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,720
 what I studied, would it bear fruits at all?

391
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,320
 But very interestingly and paradoxically, because of the social distancing measures,

392
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,600
 we birthed this online teaching ministry.

393
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,160
 So together with quite a few other committed fellow brothers and sisters, we actually began

394
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,540
 a study course called Tree of Life Discipleship Program.

395
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:36,600
 So we ran modules covering areas of calling, of faith at work, of relationship, of leadership,

396
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
 and of restoration.

397
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,080
 We were blessed to have the privilege to share the word with people from within and from

398
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,200
 outside of Bain, and also beyond Hong Kong.

399
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:55,760
 Now still in our small lives, in our own lives, even as our winters transit into spring, we

400
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:04,600
 sometimes find it hard to credit the small gleams of hope of larger life to come.

401
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,600
 We sometimes find it hard to find hope until we find that the outcome is secure.

402
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:18,920
 So therefore spring, spring teaches us to look carefully, really carefully for the green

403
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:28,120
 stems of possibilities, for the intuition that may turn into a larger insight, for the

404
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:35,840
 touch that will unfreeze a frozen relationship, especially for families who are broken apart

405
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:45,000
 physically, geographically, or emotionally, for the strangest act of kindness that will

406
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,900
 make the world seem more hospitable again all over.

407
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:58,080
 We used to have the blessing of living in a house in the rural area for a season, and

408
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,080
 Vivian loved to tend to the garden.

409
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:09,040
 The garden was filled with undergrowth, with trees, fruits, in the tiny meadow with flowers

410
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,720
 and grasses.

411
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,640
 And sometimes looking beyond the spring, we can almost envisage the next season to be

412
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,340
 a steady state of plenty, of green, of muchness.

413
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:28,880
 Of course we understand that nature does not necessarily always produce abundance.

414
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,080
 Even in Israel, there were times that flood or drought destroyed crops and threatened

415
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,400
 the lives and the livelihood of those who worked the fields.

416
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:48,800
 But nature normally takes us through a reliable cycle of scarcity and then abundance, in which

417
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:58,720
 times of deprivation actually foreshadows an eventual return to the bountiful fields.

418
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,000
 That is very biblical to see that kind of seasons in life.

419
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,040
 Be glad, people of Zion.

420
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:17,240
 Rejoice in the Lord your God, for he has given you the autumn rains because he is faithful.

421
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:24,440
 He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before.

422
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,440
 The threshing floors will be filled with grain.

423
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:37,400
 The vats will overflow new wine, new oil, new wine, new oil.

424
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,120
 So Joel was actually famous for his locust prophecy.

425
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,400
 But then when we realize the new season that we are in, then we can be assured, we can

426
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,320
 be assured that at his time, we will make up for the years of the locust.

427
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:02,280
 We will make up for the years of the loss, and we shall eat our field of good food.

428
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:11,880
 We shall be full of praise to God, as we know without question that he is in the sake of

429
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,600
 life with us.

430
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,120
 He is in the sake of life with us.

431
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:30,240
 Well, to some extent, we invest in a church plan in such a difficult social economic situation.

432
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:37,280
 And this season is actually a resemblance of Jeremiah's purchasing a piece of land when

433
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,400
 Jerusalem was besieged.

434
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:47,160
 Yet, as a church body, we are also embracing that in seasons of life, at his time, he will

435
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,320
 breathe new life into us and into the city.

436
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,560
 And in days to come, we shall bear fruits.

437
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:05,120
 You may be in a season of decline or dormancy, as in winter, or you are picking up new hope,

438
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
 as in spring.

439
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,200
 But remember that our times is in his hands.

440
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,840
 Later on, we'll have some prayer time together that will speak life into the new seasons.

441
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:25,960
 Suffix to know that the Asian Greeks has two different words for the very concept of time,

442
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,080
 chronos and kairos.

443
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:37,600
 The word chronos, or some other words that we are familiar with, chronology, chronicles,

444
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:44,240
 the word chronos refers to measured ticking time, quantitative time.

445
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,400
 Chronos is the forward propelling time that we measure with clocks, with watches.

446
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,040
 But time does not end there.

447
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:00,480
 The Greek word for time can also be kairos.

448
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:08,960
 Chronos time is where there is a divine timing, or the suitable moments where God intervenes,

449
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,980
 as if he's pressing a reboot button for us.

450
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,800
 So here we are, we learn quite a bit of Greek these days.

451
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,240
 In the past week, we learned kairos.

452
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:28,440
 God is doing a kairos, new thing, a new thing right now that has never happened before.

453
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,680
 Now we learn kairos.

454
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,160
 God does a kairos thing in a kairos time.

455
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,000
 He does a new thing in a new divine appointed time.

456
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:49,640
 Well, of course, we now know that he's turning into spring, as in the chronos of time.

457
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:56,960
 But whatever season of life you may feel you are in, God can interject and change your

458
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,160
 course.

459
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,680
 That is his kairos moment.

460
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,440
 But even more importantly, let's seize that kairos moment, the divine time that God has

461
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,200
 ordained to live out what God has appointed us to do.

462
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:23,440
 Tolkien says, "We all have to decide what to do with the time that is given us."

463
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:31,360
 We all have to decide what to do with the time given us.

464
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:38,440
 I had the privilege of submitting some of my homework assignments to Dr. and Reverend

465
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:45,960
 Philip Young, who is by himself a medical doctor, but he also later changed tracks to

466
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,800
 become lecturer in the China Graduate School of Theology.

467
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,600
 He had always been a beloved teacher, well-known in the local scene for the Word of God in

468
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:03,040
 Old Testament as well as marketplace theology.

469
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:10,560
 He was writing these comments to me well before he himself was diagnosed in aggressive cancer.

470
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:17,240
 So I have the privilege to share some of his thoughts.

471
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:25,880
 It is not easy to face the cruel reality of death and the uncertainties of life.

472
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:32,000
 How true it is that life is not in our own hands, but more importantly, it's not in the

473
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,400
 hands of fate either, but it is in our God, our creator.

474
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,560
 And in him, we do have the hope, not only of the eternal life after death, but also

475
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,520
 in the sovereign God who will work out his purposes in the given time of our life on

476
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,900
 earth.

477
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:02,720
 For this reason, we, myself included, I will have nothing to lose or to fear.

478
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:10,160
 Everything I ever had is from him, and he will fulfill his goodwill in and through my

479
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,640
 life, our lives.

480
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:20,960
 Listen and attend to whatever burden God puts in your heart, in our hearts, and live it

481
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,520
 out to the best of our abilities.

482
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,560
 It is the quality, not the quantity, that matters in the end.

483
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,760
 And anything done for the Lord's sake has eternal meaning and significance.

484
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,360
 Remember Jesus' scar.

485
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,760
 Remember the leaf by a nickel.

486
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:51,480
 It represents a glorious tree in a magnificent countryside.

487
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:59,120
 I believe that the most important thing in life is relationship with God, with people

488
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,680
 around us, and with ourselves.

489
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:11,320
 And we are to cherish these gifts and make them a special offering to our creator God

490
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,200
 with gratitude and love.

491
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,720
 This is what life is all about.

492
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:25,420
 While I still struggle often as much as Nicol did, wondering whether the trivial things

493
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,160
 that I did ever matter.

494
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:35,720
 But we are also encouraged to know that while we may only be drawing a very small leaf of

495
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:43,520
 that gigantic tree, it is a miniature representation of his enormous good.

496
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:54,920
 And in seasons and at the right time, he will bring our seed of faithful work to full fruition.

497
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,680
 Can I invite all of us to stand?

498
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:06,000
 It's important that at the turn of season that we commit ourselves new hope, which really

499
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 comes from the Lord.

500
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,160
 I also heard from some sharing from other fellow members that that new hope should also

501
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,320
 include a renewed commitment and relationship in the family.

502
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:26,720
 So I'm hoping that indeed we take this opportunity that you gather in small groups of two or

503
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:34,560
 three, that you pray and speak into that new hope that God has installed for you.

504
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:42,200
 So pray for the new hope and pray for renewed family commitments if you do have a family.

505
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,600
 So shall we spend the next two or three minutes praying for each other before we have corporate

506
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,880
 prayers and closures?

507
00:41:50,880 --> 00:42:00,200
 For those young kids that are brought together to St. Louis, who saw how winter transited

508
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,080
 into spring as they saw all the new sprouts of leaves.

509
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,720
 Now they are grown up and we're entering into a new relationship.

510
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:17,440
 So new hope for the new season for me is also renewed relationship with them as adults.

511
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,720
 So I want to say a prayer on behalf of this congregation together with all of us into

512
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,720
 our families.

513
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:31,640
 Dear Lord, we just want to thank you as we turn into new season, help us seize the Kairos

514
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,640
 moment.

515
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:40,120
 Lord, we thank you that you put us into different families surrounded by loved ones.

516
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:48,320
 And regardless of the former, of the past, of how sometimes, somehow our relationships

517
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:56,840
 are frozen, are broken, Lord, we ask for your renewal in a new season, in a new season that

518
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:05,280
 we find renewal and restoration of those loving relationship in family, in community, and

519
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,400
 even in the society.

520
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,900
 We thank you because in you we find that new hope.

521
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,280
 And we know there is this divine moment that you intervene in our lives.

522
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,080
 In Jesus name, amen, amen.
