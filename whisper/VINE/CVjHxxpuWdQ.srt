1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,600
 Words, voice, sound, speech, the very things that are simple to you have become the sweetest

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,960
 of all sounds to me.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,440
 You know, it's hard to describe what it's like to be rendered silent by an angel for

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:29,440
 a year, to have those words and the voice and the sound and the speech stilled within

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,440
 you.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:37,520
 It feels a little bit like the silencing of your soul, to be able to speak and then at

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,160
 a command, nothing but silence for a year.

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,800
 My dear wife Elizabeth always jokes that in all of the long, long years of our marriage,

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,680
 it was the only time she ever knew true peace.

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,800
 True peace.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,880
 If you lend me your ears for a few moments, I want to tell you a little bit about what

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,000
 true peace actually is.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,380
 My story, to understand it, you have to first of all understand my ancestors.

14
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,160
 I was literally born into the priesthood.

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,000
 I'm from the tribe of Abidjar and from the youngest of ages, all I've ever known is what

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,160
 it is to be a priest, be a round priest, to grow up with that as my family.

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,720
 You may not know this, but there are 18,000 priests in our land.

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,320
 We're broken into 24 different divisions of 750 priests in every division.

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,800
 For the majority of our time, we're just in the villages, in our hometowns and studying

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,200
 the scripture and helping people to understand God and the Torah and the prophets.

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,320
 It's a joy to be able to walk pastorally with those around us.

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,840
 But for two weeks in the year, for two weeks, each division is invited up to serve in Jerusalem,

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,160
 to go to the temple, which shines like a jewel on the top of Mount Zion, the beauty of the

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,240
 temple shown to all people.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,240
 We get to be there for two weeks, serving the worshipers in Jerusalem, helping with

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,400
 the sacrifices, providing the daily rituals of prayer and song and music.

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,200
 And we get to be there as the priest on behalf of all of the people of the land.

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,400
 I've often thought to myself in those two weeks when I'm standing there in the temple

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,680
 how privileged I am, how chosen I am of God, that God would choose me from a young age

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,240
 to be a priest.

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,960
 The idea of being chosen is actually what my story is all about.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,520
 One of the things that we do when we're in those two weeks in the temple is one of the

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,120
 priests, only one, but one of the priests is chosen by lot to be the one who can go

34
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,120
 beyond the curtain into the Holy of Holies, the very place where God's presence is.

35
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,680
 I mean, you can serve as a priest all of your life and never be chosen for that honor.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:18,880
 I had been a priest for 70 years, but on that day, on that one special day, my luck came

37
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
 up.

38
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,080
 I had heard stories, of course, from the other priests over the years of what it was like

39
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,880
 to be behind the veil, behind the curtain, of what it was like to go inside, to be in

40
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,360
 the very presence of God.

41
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,760
 Every one of them had talked of the stories of the glory that it felt, the true beauty

42
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,640
 of being in the presence of God.

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,640
 Each one of them had spoken about the intimacy of God's presence, and I longed for it.

44
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,160
 But the thing that they spoke of the most, every single priest who had been beyond the

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,600
 curtain, the one thing they spoke of the most, that they sung songs about, told stories about,

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 was this, that it was the first time in their lives that they truly knew peace.

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,960
 Peace.

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,680
 Peace is an important concept for us Jews.

49
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,440
 Actually, that's not a good way of saying it.

50
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,480
 Let me say it like this.

51
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,520
 Peace is the very foundation and structure of our faith.

52
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,040
 It's what our faith is all about.

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,480
 You Gentiles, you often think of peace simply as the idea of the cessation of an argument

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:35,160
 or the absence of war, but for us Jews, peace isn't about the absence of something.

55
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,080
 It's about the presence of something.

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,260
 It's not about what's not there anymore.

57
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,800
 It's about what has come to be there in that moment.

58
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,560
 For us Jews, peace is described by this one word in our tongue, shalom.

59
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,120
 Shalom, literally translated, means wholeness, but it carries with it a much broader set

60
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,220
 of ideas.

61
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,480
 The ideas of being safe and secure.

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,620
 The ideas of being restored.

63
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,400
 The ideas of knowing perfection and trueness.

64
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,800
 The ideas of an intimacy that enables you to truly rest.

65
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,600
 There are other words, too, within this idea of shalom.

66
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
 The word shalem, which means restoration.

67
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,280
 The word shalomet, which means to have perfection.

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,420
 So for us Jews, when we think of the idea of peace, we're talking about a moment where

69
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,400
 we come together to know the perfection of God, where we come to understand what it is

70
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,000
 to truly be human, to be made in His image, where we are finally in a place where wholeness,

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,180
 just as we were created to be, actually is.

72
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,700
 It's a wonderful thing.

73
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,020
 One of my old rabbis once described it to me like this.

74
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,840
 He said, "For us, shalom is, it's like the coming together of two opposing opposites,

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,040
 two separate opposites coming together to form one new shared reality."

76
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:08,060
 When those things that are opposed to one another come together and form a new relationship,

77
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,200
 this is wholeness.

78
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:17,000
 It is restoration, perfection, shalom, peace.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,120
 All of which brings me back to that day when my lot was chosen.

80
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,580
 I remember feeling incredibly excited.

81
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,840
 This was my moment to go beyond that veil into the Holy of Holies to witness something

82
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,920
 of God that I had never witnessed before.

83
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,040
 I remember grabbing the curtain and pulling it back and walking on in.

84
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,000
 Oh, the joy I felt.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,640
 And as the curtain closed behind me, suddenly I heard nothing, silence, which when you come

86
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,220
 to understand the rest of my story is quite ironic.

87
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,400
 But in that moment, it was beautiful.

88
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,760
 I had just gone from the inner courts where the slaughtering of the animals was, where

89
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,080
 the worship was taking place, where the prayers were being prayed, the cacophony of noise,

90
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,120
 and then suddenly, absolutely silence.

91
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,480
 Nothing.

92
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,240
 Just me and the presence of God.

93
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,280
 It's hard to describe to you the joy that it feels to have the whole world turned off

94
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,480
 and only God be with you.

95
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,240
 It's hard to explain to you what it was like for me to suddenly know that I was truly,

96
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,520
 deeply the only one who was in the world for Him.

97
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,040
 It felt like the whole world had stopped and there I was caught in the love of Yahweh.

98
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,520
 It was like I was truly me for the very first time.

99
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,840
 In fact, I felt younger.

100
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,120
 I felt like a new man.

101
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,840
 I felt like everything else had changed and suddenly I was who I was truly created to

102
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
 be, the image of God.

103
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,960
 Before God, it was wonderful.

104
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,840
 I almost forgot that the reason I was there was to take the incense and to light it.

105
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,920
 So I started to walk towards the incense table and then I realized I was not alone, that

106
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,320
 there was another person there.

107
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,440
 I thought at first maybe it was another priest who snuck in, who had defied the laws, who

108
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,560
 were going to be killed in the presence of God, but to my relief and horror, it wasn't

109
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,360
 a man at all.

110
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,680
 There was a being next to the incense table.

111
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,280
 Now I had heard of angels.

112
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,920
 I had read about angels.

113
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:45,980
 I had even taught about angels, but nothing ever had prepared me to encounter an angel.

114
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,200
 It was overwhelming.

115
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,440
 Every part of my body was shaking and trembling.

116
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,480
 It felt like the whole of his gaze was internalizing everything that I had ever done.

117
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,200
 I was overwhelmed with the smallness that I felt in the glory of his presence, the one

118
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,200
 who is holy, the one who is not holy.

119
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,080
 And as I was trembling, he walked forward and he said these words.

120
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,480
 And when he opened his mouth, it felt like the whole of the universe was saying what

121
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
 he was saying.

122
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,040
 He says, "Do not be afraid, Zachariah, for your prayers have been heard and answered.

123
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,240
 Elizabeth, your wife, will be with child and she will bring forth a son and you will name

124
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,840
 him John."

125
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,520
 And then he began to tell me what my son would do.

126
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,280
 My son would be filled with the Holy Spirit from birth.

127
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,900
 My son would be the one who would prepare the way for the coming Messiah.

128
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,240
 My son would help to invite Israel to repentance for their sins so that they could be prepared

129
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,240
 for the arrival of none other than the Son of God.

130
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
 My son!

131
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,080
 I mean, the words of the angel seemed like fantasy to me.

132
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,200
 Words that I could not comprehend, ideas that I could not fathom, a hope that I had for

133
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,760
 many years pushed down, gotten rid of, pushed away, silence.

134
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,400
 And I thought in that moment that what if this doesn't happen?

135
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,160
 What if those angels' words were not true?

136
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,720
 So I turned to face him.

137
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,920
 And I said, "How can any of this be possible?

138
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:35,340
 For having you not seen how old I am and Elizabeth is even older, how could we ever?"

139
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,600
 It was not my finest moment.

140
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,320
 I mean, think about it.

141
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,440
 I'm finally in the wholeness of the presence of God.

142
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,960
 I'm finally the person I was truly created to be.

143
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,640
 And in the moment of being encountered God's presence, I turned my back on him.

144
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
 I doubt.

145
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,000
 I doubt the very words that have come from his mouth.

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,600
 I doubt the promise that he has brought to me.

147
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:09,120
 I turned my back on the one who has opened his arms to me and immediately I felt old

148
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,320
 again.

149
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:21,200
 The angel then said these sobering words, "Because you have doubted, Zachariah, your

150
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,320
 tongue now will be stilled and you will not be able to speak again until the prophecy

151
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,320
 I have brought comes to pass," and a weight came in my mouth.

152
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,800
 My tongue stilled within me.

153
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,400
 I could no longer make any sound.

154
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,320
 Every day from that moment onwards, every day was a reminder to me of the reality of

155
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,400
 my doubts and my turning of my back on another.

156
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:57,480
 Every moment of every day realizing that I could not express anything to anyone.

157
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,000
 And yet every day, Elizabeth, pregnant with our child, growing and growing.

158
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,200
 She had never been more radiant nor beautiful.

159
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,080
 And then that day, the day I thought would never come, the day when Elizabeth gave birth

160
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,680
 to a boy.

161
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,400
 And then on the eighth day, when we circumcised our children, the child is brought to me and

162
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:28,280
 all of the family are leaning in, wanting to know, "What will I name him?"

163
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:34,480
 I grab a parchment and I start to write down the name, "John."

164
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,760
 And I write it out as much as I can in bold letters, "John, his name will be John."

165
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,440
 And in that moment, you will never guess what happened.

166
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,200
 I felt the rush of the Holy Spirit.

167
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,840
 I felt like I was lifted up where I was.

168
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,560
 It was almost like the rest of the world disappeared again.

169
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,160
 And there I was back in the holy of holies once more, back in the presence of God again.

170
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,920
 And in that moment, I felt my tongue loosened in my mouth.

171
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,760
 I felt like all of those months of agony where I was walking in the brokenness of my doubt

172
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:15,440
 were washed away, and now suddenly a new moment had arrived where two opposing entities, me

173
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,280
 who had turned my back on God and God who is holy and mighty, now could come together

174
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,840
 again as one.

175
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,800
 I felt forgiveness.

176
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,400
 I felt life.

177
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,040
 I felt the joy of what it is to know my sins were washed away.

178
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,000
 And in the beauty of that moment, I began to shout.

179
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,880
 I began to praise.

180
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,560
 I sang a song.

181
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,040
 And I sang, and I sang, and I sang, and I sang, because peace had come, and peace was

182
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,280
 here, and peace always demands a song.

 [APPLAUSE]

424
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:08,580
 One of my earliest childhood memories

425
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,180
 was hearing the word "Meshiach."

426
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,640
 My father, at the end of every day,

427
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,220
 would gather up the children and put us on his lap.

428
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,780
 And he would tell us the stories of the prophets of old,

429
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,300
 the stories of our ancestors.

430
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,200
 And the stories he would always go to

431
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,900
 were the ones about the Meshiach.

432
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,540
 I heard that name long before I remember hearing my own name.

433
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,220
 "Meshiach" in our tongue literally means "the anointed."

434
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,020
 The idea of somebody being a Meshiach

435
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,460
 is that that person has been anointed by Yahweh,

436
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,700
 that Yahweh has set them aside for a certain period of time

437
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,300
 to do some things that Yahweh wants them to do.

438
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,180
 And so my father would tell us stories

439
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,540
 of Samuel and Isaiah and King David,

440
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,380
 the ones who had been anointed with oil,

441
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:02,620
 Meshiached with oil, to become a Meshiach for the people.

442
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,820
 The idea of the oil was really important.

443
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,980
 It was really something that my dad would talk about all

444
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,780
 the time.

445
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,260
 He would say, in the same way that we pour oil on our hands

446
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,180
 when our hands are chapped and sore and dry and dirty,

447
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,140
 and the oil brings them to softness and a healing

448
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,100
 and a restoration and new life, so the Meshiach,

449
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,540
 when they are anointed by God, they

450
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,900
 are used to bring healing and comfort and revival and life

451
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,460
 to the dry and cracked and weary people of the world.

452
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,940
 And, oh, the stories that he would tell

453
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,660
 were just so wonderful to us.

454
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,980
 It was our favorite time in the day.

455
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,180
 And my dad, after a while, began to tell us a story

456
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:52,140
 about a coming Meshiach, not just an anointed one,

457
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,820
 but the anointed one, the one who would come and pour

458
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,900
 his oil, if you will, on all of humanity,

459
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,180
 the one who would come and set us all free,

460
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,460
 washing away our sin, restoring us in relationship

461
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,700
 with Yahweh, the one who would establish for all time

462
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,020
 a place of repentance and life and the fullness of everything.

463
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,740
 And when my dad told the stories of a coming Meshiach,

464
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,500
 we would lean forward with joy in our hearts.

465
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,740
 We could not wait.

466
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:28,460
 But waiting seemed to be all we ever did.

467
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,860
 In fact, my people have been waiting for years, generation

468
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,540
 after generation after generation,

469
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,260
 with the idea that this Meshiach, this Messiah in your tongue

470
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,740
 will come one day, and we're still waiting.

471
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,660
 When I came of age, my father's stories

472
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,900
 didn't seem to hold the same vibrancy anymore.

473
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,860
 It's interesting, isn't it, how a joy and a fantasy

474
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,140
 from childhood can become an adult's embarrassment

475
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,220
 when you get a bit older.

476
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,460
 And I remember feeling to myself that this longed

477
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,420
 for hope of a coming Messiah was still such a long way away.

478
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,820
 Should we really hold onto that hope?

479
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,260
 I mean, is this really an expectation we should have?

480
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,460
 I almost felt like my father had set me up

481
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,660
 to fail, that my father had put in me

482
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,820
 this desire for the coming together of all things

483
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,820
 under God once again, and it was never going to happen.

484
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,180
 The tension between me and my father grew.

485
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,020
 I began to find his attitude, his constant hope,

486
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,780
 his constant talk about this coming Messiah,

487
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,340
 it just grated on me.

488
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,860
 I felt like it was just air that had no substance anymore.

489
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,660
 I wonder if you've ever felt a little bit like that.

490
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,700
 When I came of age, my mother had a friend

491
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,620
 whose son was a shepherd, and he said

492
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,460
 he would be willing to take me as an apprentice under him,

493
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,620
 and I couldn't leave quick enough.

494
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,220
 I gathered up my stuff, said goodbye to my family,

495
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,980
 and ever since then I've been a shepherd.

496
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,700
 The shepherd has been a wonderful life for me.

497
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,460
 I've been truly blessed with it.

498
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,740
 I get to spend every single day, the majority of my time,

499
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,740
 outside in the beauty of the hills of the Judean wilderness.

500
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,700
 I mean, if you haven't seen them,

501
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,900
 you should see them someday.

502
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,180
 They are just glorious.

503
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,180
 And people often think that shepherds are lonely.

504
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,300
 That's a bit of a misconception.

505
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,140
 We're not lonely at all.

506
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,980
 We actually travel in groups.

507
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,540
 There's usually three or four of us

508
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,860
 with our flocks at any one time.

509
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,820
 And my favorite time of the day

510
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,740
 is right towards the end of the day,

511
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,300
 right towards the night where we all sit around

512
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,140
 and we start a fire.

513
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,500
 It can get pretty chilly in those Judean hills,

514
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,340
 and we sit around a fire together,

515
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,540
 and as we're talking around the fire,

516
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,300
 you'll never guess what happens.

517
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,700
 The other men will always turn to me and say,

518
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,140
 "Tell us some of the stories your father told you.

519
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,580
 Tell us of the messiahs of the old

520
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,100
 and the longing we have for the messiah to come."

521
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,220
 And irony out of all ironies,

522
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,500
 the one who had ran away from the stories of his father

523
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,040
 has now become the one who tells the stories of his father

524
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,540
 to the others.

525
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,380
 I tell them with the same vibrancy, the same joy,

526
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,820
 the same enthusiasm my father said,

527
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,460
 but it's shallow and hollow inside of me

528
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,780
 because I don't really believe a word of it.

529
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,780
 The men hang off every word.

530
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,780
 I'm a great storyteller,

531
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,100
 but I still feel like I'm setting them up to fail.

532
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,440
 And then one day, everything changed.

533
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,740
 I remember the night well.

534
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,960
 I remember it because it was like

535
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,300
 the blackest of all nights.

536
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,940
 It was like a darkness had almost come across the land.

537
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,180
 It was like formless and a void.

538
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,020
 It almost felt to me a little bit like

539
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,380
 what our scriptures describe,

540
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,020
 right at the start of all things,

541
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,140
 the beginning of the world and the voidness and darkness

542
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,540
 that was hovering there in creation.

543
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:11,580
 And then in the darkness, suddenly a glorious light.

544
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,640
 It was as if the whole sky lit up.

545
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,340
 There was a shaft of light that shone down from the sky

546
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,660
 that came upon us as shepherds,

547
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,680
 and we were overwhelmed immediately.

548
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,180
 I remember thinking to myself

549
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,340
 that I should be blinded by this light.

550
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,060
 It was that bright, but I wasn't blinded.

551
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,020
 In fact, the opposite happened.

552
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,980
 For the first time in my life, everything seemed clear.

553
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,140
 I mean, I could almost see things

554
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,580
 like I had never seen them before,

555
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,060
 as if for the rest of my life before,

556
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,280
 my eyes had only been half open.

557
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,180
 And then a being appeared.

558
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,620
 I can't describe to you what this being was like.

559
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,640
 It wasn't human,

560
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,880
 but there was a sense of majesty and glory and honor to it.

561
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,420
 And immediately we were terrified.

562
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,740
 We fell onto the floor.

563
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,300
 We were shaking uncontrollably.

564
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,980
 And then a voice came to us.

565
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,820
 And when this voice came,

566
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,700
 it was like the whole universe was saying this.

567
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,280
 And for me personally,

568
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,040
 it wasn't like I was hearing the voice

569
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,380
 with my ears externally.

570
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,260
 It was as if the voice was reverberating inside of me

571
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,860
 and almost coming out of me.

572
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,020
 It said, "Do not be afraid, shepherds,

573
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,720
 for we bring you great news and a joy and a tiding to all,

574
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,180
 that today, this very day,

575
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,480
 your Savior, your Messiah has been born.

576
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,060
 In the town of David,

577
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,100
 you will find a child wrapped up in clothes

578
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,780
 and lying in a manger."

579
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,940
 And almost as soon as those words had happened,

580
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,940
 suddenly a great heavenly hosts appeared before us,

581
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,620
 a choir of angels,

582
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,940
 and they sang a song, a holy song,

583
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,500
 glory to God in the highest.

584
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,780
 And on earth,

585
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,780
 peace will rest on those upon whom His favor is.

586
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:13,120
 And as soon as it happened, they were gone.

587
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,900
 Silence was upon us.

588
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,940
 And we, with our faces down on the soil,

589
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,260
 trembling as we were,

590
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,660
 no one made a noise,

591
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,740
 almost as if none of us wanted to break the sacredness

592
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,040
 with the ugliness of human words.

593
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,600
 And then something happened

594
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,420
 that hadn't happened to me in years.

595
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,540
 Tears came.

596
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,540
 Tears just started to stream down my face.

597
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,500
 First of all, they were tears of shame,

598
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,940
 tears of the many years

599
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,940
 that I had turned my back on my family,

600
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,880
 tears of the many years

601
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,780
 that I had ignored the promises of the prophets of old,

602
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,020
 tears where I had turned my back on my faith

603
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,140
 and not believed, not longed,

604
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,300
 not held the waiting in my heart,

605
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,360
 tears of shame for what I had done.

606
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,720
 But then the tears were warm and salty,

607
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,580
 the tears of forgiveness,

608
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,820
 the tears that only come when we know

609
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,540
 that we're no longer at enmity with God,

610
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,900
 that we're no longer separated from Him.

611
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,860
 I began to cry tears of joy,

612
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,780
 knowing that I am forgiven,

613
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,260
 knowing that because the Messiah has come,

614
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,460
 our longed-for wait was over,

615
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,960
 knowing that those that had been separated once before

616
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,980
 by sin from a holy and majestic God

617
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,860
 were now being brought back together again,

618
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,380
 two opposites becoming one whole.

619
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,980
 I realized in that moment, peace was here,

620
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:02,220
 true peace, shalom like we had always wanted.

621
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,100
 The desire was now here.

622
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,360
 And in this child, in a manger,

623
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,040
 wrapped with cloth,

624
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,800
 was not just the idea of peace,

625
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,860
 not just the offer of peace,

626
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,120
 but in this one, it was peace.

627
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,360
 Emmanuel, God with us,

628
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,940
 the incarnation, fully God, fully human,

629
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,460
 in the one entity, I mean, that's what peace is all about,

630
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,660
 opposing things, coming together

631
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,760
 to form a new perfect whole in Jesus.

632
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,180
 We now see not just the idea of peace,

633
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,380
 but the person of peace,

634
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,460
 stepping into the gap, meeting us in our brokenness,

635
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,580
 drawing us now into reconciled,

636
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,980
 restored relationship with God.

637
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,980
 I was filled with peace.

638
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:05,580
 We jumped up, left our sheep behind,

639
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,340
 ran to Bethlehem.

640
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,540
 And when my eyes saw the child for the first time,

641
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,260
 I remember thinking to myself,

642
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,660
 if only my father was here,

643
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,300
 because his dream, his hope,

644
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,020
 had literally come.

645
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,300
 And you need to know,

646
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,120
 just a week before your celebration of Christmas,

647
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,820
 that your hope, your dream, has also come.

648
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,740
 You need to know that the same washing of my sins,

649
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,240
 those warm and salty tears that set me anew and afresh,

650
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,080
 the same washing has happened now for you.

651
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,900
 You need to know that if you have ever felt

652
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,140
 at enmity with God, away from Him

653
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,860
 because of your sin and your brokenness,

654
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,020
 that you've been now drawn near

655
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:59,020
 because of the Mashiach, the Messiah has arrived.

656
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,460
 You need to know that just like for me,

657
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,100
 there is a song for the not so holy,

658
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,200
 of a future that is not so distant from us.

659
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,600
 For the Lord has come.

660
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,900
 Do not be afraid.

661
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,300
 As you look towards this week,

662
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,680
 may you know the peace of Christ upon you

663
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,560
 like never before.

664
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,380
 May you know that in that child,

665
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,520
 there is reconciliation, restoration,

666
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,300
 because God is not distant.

667
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,140
 He is here.

668
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,080
 Would you pray with me?

669
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,920
 I wonder whether you'd stand.

670
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,160
 I'd love to pray with you.

671
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:47,920
 I'm gonna pray as Andrew, not as Shepherd, okay?

672
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,760
 Just so you know.

673
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,200
 (congregation laughing)

674
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,720
 Let's pray.

675
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,920
 Father, we are grateful,

676
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,000
 grateful for this moment of sacredness

677
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,640
 as we listen to the Christmas story of peace

678
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,240
 in a different way this morning.

679
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,940
 Father, we're thankful that peace is not

680
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,000
 at the hands of the herds of this world.

681
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,640
 We're grateful that peace is not won for us

682
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,720
 by might or force or violence.

683
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:26,360
 We're grateful that peace is not the absence of conflict,

684
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,600
 but the presence of you, even amidst the conflict.

685
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,680
 We're grateful, Lord, that the peace that we get to know,

686
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,800
 the one that truly restores our heart and our soul

687
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,360
 is a peace that you purchase on the cross,

688
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,680
 that your resurrection proves,

689
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,800
 and the descending of your Spirit seals in us,

690
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,560
 a peace to know that our sins are forgiven,

691
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,760
 and that our lives will be made new.

692
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,600
 Lord, I wanna pray for anyone here in this room

693
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,400
 who needs that message afresh today.

694
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,180
 I wanna pray for these brothers and sisters, Lord,

695
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,080
 and those that are watching online right now,

696
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,440
 that they would know the power of your peace.

697
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,400
 Lord, I pray that if there's anything that's going on

698
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,840
 in the lives of these people,

699
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,940
 in the lives of us as a community here at the Vine,

700
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,060
 that is keeping us in a place of stress, anxiety, fear,

701
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,300
 a place where we don't feel at peace.

702
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,280
 Lord, we come to you this morning,

703
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,460
 and we ask for your presence again.

704
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,360
 Emmanuel, I pray that you would be with us,

705
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,400
 that you would draw near to those

706
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,240
 that do not feel at peace right now.

707
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,920
 And Lord, I'm sure each one of us, we have relationships,

708
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,680
 we have things that feel tense and stressy at the moment.

709
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:00,540
 Father, we just bring them to you now in prayer.

710
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:06,880
 And we ask that you would come and carry our burdens with us,

711
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,160
 lighten our load,

712
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,900
 and that those of us whose tongues feel like

713
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,560
 they've been stilled within us

714
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,880
 would feel our tongues being loosened again.

715
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,000
 Those of us that have walked away from relationships

716
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,840
 like the shepherd would at Christmas time realize

717
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,000
 that there's an invitation for restoration.

718
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,680
 Father, would you come and bring peace on earth

719
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,080
 just as it is in heaven?

720
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,600
 And may it be for your glory.

721
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,640
 And we thank you for this.

722
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,760
 In Jesus' name, Emmanuel says.

723
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,080
 We're gonna worship together one more carol,

724
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,640
 so let's join together in song.
