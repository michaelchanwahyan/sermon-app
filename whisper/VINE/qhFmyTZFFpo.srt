1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
 In the name of Jesus, everyone says, Amen.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,280
 Can we thank our worship team and just awesome.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,600
 Have a seat, have a seat.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,720
 We're pretty packed in here today.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,600
 So if you need some seats, there are some seats, I think somewhere, but there are some

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
 seats around.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
 Again, welcome.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,480
 If you're joining us online, if you're in our overflow, we love you guys.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,880
 We're sorry that you're there, but we're glad you're with us and there is no second class

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,360
 Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,760
 Amen.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,840
 So we're glad that you're with us as well.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,760
 In 2014, something happened here at the Vine.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,800
 It was in the summer of 2014.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,720
 Something happened here at the Vine that so changed, completely changed my expectations

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,680
 of the work of Christ in the world today.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,800
 On this particular Sunday, a 25 year old French lady from a Muslim background walked into

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,680
 Pacific Coffee downstairs in search of her Sunday morning caffeine fix.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,240
 She had no idea that she had just walked into a church.

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,960
 She thought she was just coming in to get a cup of coffee, but she was struck immediately

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,200
 by the reality that this Pacific Coffee was the most popular Pacific Coffee she had ever

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,700
 seen in her life.

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,360
 It was filled with lots and lots of people who were chatting and laughing and hanging

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,840
 out and talking.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,720
 And she was used to her Sunday morning caffeine fix normally being a quiet, sleepy kind of

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,900
 vibe, but here it was loud and raucous.

27
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,080
 She grabbed her coffee and she couldn't find a seat in Pacific Coffee because it was so

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
 full.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,960
 So she went and she stood by the stairs at the back of our Pacific Coffee, by the stairs

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,320
 that go up into the rest of our building.

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,220
 And as she's standing there sipping her coffee, marveling at how a rock concert has just finished

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:08,360
 in this space, suddenly a asylum seeker, one of our asylum seekers kids trips and falls

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,360
 down the stairs right in front of her.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,200
 And immediately she looks around to see if the parent is there and if the parent is going

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,240
 to react and respond, but she couldn't see a parent.

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,640
 And so she turned and she knelt down to help this kid up.

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,660
 Now, thankfully he wasn't seriously hurt at all, but she helps him up.

38
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,120
 And because she speaks French, that's her mother language, she just starts speaking

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,280
 to him in French.

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,800
 I think when you panic and something like that happens, you just default to your natural

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 language.

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,200
 She started speaking to him in French.

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,600
 Amazingly though, this little boy was from West Africa and French was his mother tongue

44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,800
 as well.

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,700
 And so he was able to talk to her in French and he grabs her by the hand and he starts

46
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,720
 walking her up the stairs.

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,320
 And she thinks that Pacific coffee must have a second level to it and that the parents

48
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,920
 are up there somewhere.

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,280
 And so she follows him as he's leading her up the stairs.

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,320
 He leads her up the first floor, up to the second floor.

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,800
 He leads her into the doors right here, right as the worship is starting for our 11 o'clock

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,220
 service.

53
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,600
 And as he leads her in, he then lets go of her hand and he runs away.

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,520
 And she's standing there wondering what is going on.

55
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,720
 For the next 90 minutes, the majority of the next 90 minutes, she's just stood right there

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,120
 and she's crying and crying and crying and she has no idea why she's crying.

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,700
 She describes it to me just a few months later as if this warmth had just come over her.

58
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,720
 And she said she had never felt a sense of love or peace like that in her life ever before.

59
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,940
 At the end of the service, she comes forward speaking in French, trying to find somebody

60
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,180
 who speaks French.

61
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,620
 Thankfully, there was a French family that was sitting just a couple of rows towards

62
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,300
 the front and we were able to connect them together and over the process of a conversation

63
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:17,380
 right there and then at the front of the church, this Muslim lady gives her life to Jesus.

64
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,340
 Just a few months later, she does Alpha for the first time.

65
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,340
 She does our French Alpha.

66
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,820
 We were running a French speaking Alpha at that time.

67
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,100
 She commits, further commits her life to Christ through Alpha.

68
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,860
 I had the privilege of baptizing her just a few months later.

69
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:40,300
 She then was one of the leaders on our next French Alpha that we ran and she had the privilege

70
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,880
 of leading some other people to Jesus.

71
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,360
 She then came and stood in front of our whole church on a Sunday and told them the story

72
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,700
 that I've just told you and then she left us just a few months later and she's now living

73
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,940
 and working again in France.

74
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,140
 Now I would love to stand here this morning and tell you that story and tell you that

75
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,560
 the reason why this lady gave her life to Jesus is because the Vine Church has an amazing

76
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,980
 evangelistic program.

77
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,340
 That we have trained people to be on the lookout for strangers entering into Pacific Coffee

78
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,520
 on a Sunday morning.

79
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,620
 I would like to tell you that we've trained all our asylum seeker kids to fake fall down

80
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,700
 the stairs.

81
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,300
 They're like little stunt kids that fake fall down the stairs so that they can speak in

82
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,380
 French to random French speaking people who walk in.

83
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,940
 I would like to tell you that we have brought all of our French families to the front rows

84
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,620
 of the church just in case a French person comes into this church.

85
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,620
 There's no Jesus.

86
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,020
 I'd like to tell you that because then I could pretend that the reason why this person gave

87
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,100
 the life to Jesus is because the Vine is so awesome and that we have such a great evangelistic

88
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,220
 program but I love the fact that I can't stand here and tell you that.

89
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,700
 I love the fact that the only reason that that woman came to Christ on that day was

90
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,940
 because God believed it was her time.

91
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,540
 Because God did it all.

92
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,860
 That there was, I mean think about it, coming into this particular Pacific Coffee for a

93
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,300
 caffeine fix.

94
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,780
 So busy that she couldn't sit so she had to stand at the back.

95
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,060
 It just so happens that a French speaking refugee kid is able to connect with her who

96
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,340
 just randomly brings her up and makes her stand right there and then runs away.

97
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,060
 And that there happened to be a French family that was willing to share the gospel with

98
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,060
 her.

99
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,340
 I mean we can't make this stuff up.

100
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:41,140
 This is stuff that can only ever be done by a God who is able to do immeasurably more

101
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,940
 than we could ever ask or imagine.

102
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:52,780
 And when something like that happens you can only stand back and go God is amazing.

103
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,200
 Not the vine is amazing.

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,780
 Our evangelistic programs are amazing.

105
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:06,900
 God who is able to do more than we could ever ask or imagine and because God did it that

106
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,140
 way.

107
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:14,140
 That story is still one of my most favorite stories to share in some 15 years of pastoring

108
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,020
 here at the church.

109
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,500
 The apostle Paul knew something of a God who is just like that.

110
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,060
 The God who is able to do more than we could ever ask or imagine.

111
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,260
 In fact as he finishes his prayer in Ephesians 3, that majestic glorious prayer that we looked

112
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:41,140
 at last week, he decides to finish it by shifting the focus of his prayer back to this God.

113
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,580
 Which is important for Paul because he's just prayed a passionate pastoral prayer for his

114
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,580
 church.

115
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,340
 I mean he needs to spend all this time saying my hope for you is that out of the glorious

116
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,620
 riches of Christ Jesus that he would strengthen you with power by his Spirit in your inner

117
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
 being.

118
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,980
 I mean my prayer for you is that you would know that Christ lives in your heart and because

119
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,540
 of that you would be able to grasp how wide and high and deep and long the vastness of

120
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,480
 the love of Christ for you.

121
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,300
 And because of that you would know that love, experience that love, feel that love so that

122
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,620
 you would be filled to the whole measure of the wholeness of Christ.

123
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,500
 He's just prayed this passionate pastoral prayer for his people to experience God in

124
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,940
 a way that they've never experienced it before.

125
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,900
 But he gets to the end of the prayer and he realizes I can't finish there because God

126
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,440
 is always more than what we experience of him.

127
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,960
 And despite the fact that he's passionately gone I want you to really experience him.

128
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,700
 What he's also saying to his church is but I don't want to limit and I don't want you

129
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,540
 to limit your expectations of God just by what you've experienced of him.

130
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:59,020
 And so he shifts the end of his prayer back to the wonder and the majesty and the mystery

131
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:06,260
 and the glory of a God who's far greater than we could ever experience.

132
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
 I want to read it to you.

133
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,980
 He says this in Ephesians 3 verse 20 and 21.

134
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:18,140
 Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than we could ask or imagine according

135
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:24,820
 to his power that is at work within us to him be the glory in the church and in Christ

136
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:32,820
 Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever and the whole church said amen.

137
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,660
 This is known as a doxology.

138
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:42,440
 What it is is a exclamation that praises a characteristic of God that when read should

139
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,700
 cause you to enter into a place of worship as well.

140
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,780
 Paul writes these doxologies throughout his letters and there are many that he includes.

141
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:59,260
 This one is one of my particular favorites and I love it for one simple reason.

142
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,980
 Paul is challenging his church deeply on something.

143
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,000
 He's asking them actually through this doxology a very important question.

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,660
 It's an important question because he's about to enter into three more chapters in the letter,

145
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,140
 chapters four, five and six where he's going to speak about the nature that we have and

146
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,340
 the way that we should live in respect to God.

147
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:25,100
 Before we get there he finishes chapter three by asking his church a critical question.

148
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,300
 Who exactly is it that you worship?

149
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,100
 That's what he wants to ask his church and that's what I sense the Holy Spirit wants

150
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,340
 to ask you here this morning.

151
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,260
 Who exactly is it that you worship?

152
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,500
 And this is an important question for Paul because before he tells his church how they

153
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,980
 should now live in response to this God, he wants to make sure that they're worshiping

154
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,860
 the right God.

155
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,260
 And as you come into church today you might be like, "Well, of course I'm worshiping the

156
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,260
 right God, Andrew.

157
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,460
 I'm in a Christian church today and not somewhere else.

158
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,820
 I believe in Jesus.

159
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,220
 Of course I'm worshiping the right God."

160
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,140
 Paul's being a lot more nuanced than that.

161
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,780
 A lot more actually I think challenging than that.

162
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,300
 And when I read this doxology I find myself deeply challenged.

163
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:26,620
 I've read this for years and every time I read it I'm reminded of my own deficiencies.

164
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:34,060
 I'm actually reminded of how I so often can drift in my worship away from worshiping the

165
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:42,940
 God of Scripture and settling instead for worshiping the God that I have experienced.

166
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,100
 Are you tracking with me here?

167
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,740
 Now I want you to track with this because I think we can all make this mistake in our

168
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
 Christian lives.

169
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,940
 That we end up so much worshiping the God that we have actually tangibly had an experience

170
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:01,420
 of, but we kind of settle or we see that as the roof, the ceiling of our understanding

171
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,260
 of who He is.

172
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,060
 And so our worship, the God that we're worshiping, is essentially a God that we have experienced

173
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,100
 rather than the God of the nature and the character and the power and the fullness of

174
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,660
 how Scripture describes Him to us.

175
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,580
 And this is very true for us particularly when we've been disappointed by God.

176
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:25,460
 And if you're anything like me in this room, you've been disappointed by God sometimes.

177
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,100
 When we get disappointed by God or maybe God hasn't come through like we expected or our

178
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,820
 experience of God is not like the experience of the person next to us and they seem to

179
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,220
 cry every time they worship, they seem to get the gift of tongues and I don't seem to

180
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,220
 get that.

181
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,740
 And we begin to compare our experience with God, with somebody else's experience of God,

182
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,380
 and we end up worshiping a God limited by our experience and we can feel sometimes dejected

183
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,260
 in that because our experience is not someone else's experience and Paul writes to the church

184
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,380
 and says, "Hang on a sec.

185
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,220
 I want you to experience God.

186
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,500
 I mean I've just prayed this majestic prayer that you would feel His love like you've never

187
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,060
 felt Him before.

188
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,020
 Think in my being desires for you to experience Him in the greatest way you could ever experience

189
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,100
 Him but never limit your thinking or your expectations.

190
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,920
 Particularly never limit your worship just based on how you've experienced Him.

191
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,820
 It's got to be so much more."

192
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:28,060
 So if I was to ask Paul's question through this doxology to us as a modern church in

193
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,060
 a modern way, perhaps I'd ask it like this.

194
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:39,740
 Are you worshiping the God of your truth above the God of the truth?

195
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
 Say that again.

196
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:47,940
 Are you worshiping the God of your truth over and above the God of the truth?

197
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:55,580
 Have you limited God simply to your own experience of Him whether good or bad or are you able

198
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,740
 to worship Him even beyond what it is that you may have experienced?

199
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,700
 Paul writes to the church, "Oh, now to Him who is able to do whether you've experienced

200
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,780
 a lot or a little, far more than you could ever have thought.

201
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,260
 That's the God to worship."

202
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,140
 I want to actually show you how Paul does this.

203
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,260
 I'm going to break this down in this doxology because I think it's really important that

204
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,980
 we wrestle with the challenge of this but also I believe because we want to raise glory

205
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,340
 in the church and I think this is the whole of Paul's point.

206
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,700
 He talks about three elements in this doxology.

207
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,060
 The first element is you.

208
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,820
 Can you see that on the screen?

209
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,700
 Wow, modern technology, look at that.

210
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,060
 By the way, I've said this before, I'm going to say it again.

211
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:53,860
 I am terrible at writing but just track with the ugliness of my words written down and

212
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,980
 follow what we're doing here.

213
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,220
 When Paul says God is able to do immeasurably more than we could ever ask or imagine, there's

214
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,900
 an assumption Paul's making in that statement.

215
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,780
 Do you know what that assumption is?

216
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,480
 It's not a rhetorical question, it is actually a question.

217
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,260
 What is the assumption he's making?

218
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,020
 Because if God can do more than you ever ask or imagine, what is He actually assuming?

219
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:23,540
 That you are asking and that you are imagining, which maybe for some churches that's a big

220
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,900
 assumption.

221
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:30,020
 But he's assuming of his church in Ephesus that they are actually doing two things.

222
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,540
 That they are asking, which is this idea of prayer, and that they are, the word he uses

223
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,540
 in the Greek, this idea of imagine, which we could think of it as like a dream, like

224
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:47,100
 dreaming or like a vision or the way in which we think, these things.

225
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,260
 The idea of our mind being engaged in life and what we hope and dream for life.

226
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,940
 Paul's assumption is that the church that you are praying and you're dreaming, that

227
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,340
 you are on your knees praying out for God to do some things in your life to shape and

228
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,180
 to work your life in certain ways, that you have a passion and a heart to believe that

229
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,620
 prayer can change things.

230
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,900
 And that you're not just praying for yourself, but you're praying for our city of Hong Kong

231
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,580
 in such an important time as this and that the church together is praying and believing.

232
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,980
 He's assuming that that's what's happening.

233
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,980
 He's also assuming that you're not just praying, but you're dreaming.

234
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,420
 That you've got some ideas, that you're thinking, that the thoughts of your mind are hopeful,

235
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,540
 that you're dreaming for a better future for Hong Kong, that you're dreaming for a better

236
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,380
 future for yourself and for your family.

237
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,380
 That that future is not just some future out there, but is rooted in the kingdom and rooted

238
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,180
 in God's heart, that you're imagining what it would look like if the kingdom of God came

239
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,540
 to earth just like Jesus prayed about in his prayer, that it would be on earth as it is

240
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
 in heaven.

241
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,140
 That's what's going on in your mind and your heart that you're passionate about.

242
00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:00,020
 This idea of praying and this idea of imagining and dreaming, Paul says this important thing.

243
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:05,220
 He says, "According to the power that is at work in you."

244
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:13,140
 So he says that there's a power that God does to help us to pray and help us to dream, which

245
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,140
 is really important.

246
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,540
 You're not praying and you're not dreaming or imagining in a vacuum.

247
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,660
 The power he mentions here is that power he's just prayed about in the prayer in a few verses

248
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:30,340
 earlier, that you would be strengthened with power by the spirit in your inner being.

249
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,420
 He's like, "That power is already at work in you, for you have already been rooted and

250
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,580
 established in love."

251
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,340
 And because that power is at work in you, you can trust that the prayers that you're

252
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,940
 praying are on the heart of God.

253
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,740
 You can trust that the dreams and the imaginations that you hold in your heart have been placed

254
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,420
 there and are being fanned into flame by the spirit of God.

255
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,660
 It is a wonderful, beautiful thing.

256
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,420
 God doesn't ask his church to pray and leave it in a vacuum.

257
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,580
 He asks his church to pray and he asks his church to dream for a better future, but then

258
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:08,660
 he puts his power inside of us to enable us to do that in a way that brings true fruit

259
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,660
 in this world.

260
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,420
 Isn't that beautiful?

261
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,380
 No one thinks that's beautiful.

262
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,100
 Is that beautiful?

263
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,700
 Now notice, he then says this though.

264
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,980
 He says, "That's all that is assumed here."

265
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,220
 But notice this, he then says, "But there is this role that God plays."

266
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,460
 And I'm going to use my high school level maths here.

267
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,420
 There's a sign in maths, greater than.

268
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
 Do you see this?

269
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
 This is greater than.

270
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,700
 Look at that.

271
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,140
 He says that God, here's what you need to know about God.

272
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,960
 God is able to do greater than, more than you could ever ask, and more than you could

273
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,300
 ever dream.

274
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,860
 And he's saying if you want to worship God, who exactly is the God that you worship?

275
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,300
 He's like, "You have to worship the one who is abundantly, immeasurably more than you

276
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,020
 could ever dream, more than you could ever imagine."

277
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,900
 Because he is so grand, so vast.

278
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,080
 His ways are higher than your ways.

279
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,120
 His thoughts are greater than your thoughts.

280
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,940
 And if you've just limited him to your own experience of him, you need to break yourself

281
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
 out of that.

282
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,620
 And he says, "Here's how you do it.

283
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:22,860
 You believe in a God who is immeasurably more than you have ever dreamt or imagined."

284
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,700
 What a glorious thing he's saying here.

285
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,960
 Now I want you to see this.

286
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:37,360
 The problem we have in the church, the problem I think we have in us, I want that one.

287
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,640
 That one, thank you.

288
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,080
 The problem we have is that we get stuck, notice this, on this side of the equation

289
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,680
 I think all the time.

290
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,000
 And we get stuck on that side of the equation for I think important reason.

291
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,400
 Listen to this.

292
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,260
 It is hard to believe in a God who can do immeasurably more than we could ever ask and

293
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,720
 imagine if we don't first believe in a God who can actually do what we ask and imagine.

294
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
 Are you with me?

295
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,520
 I mean it's hard, right, to take the jump over that equation to an immeasurably more

296
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,760
 God if we're already struggling to have the faith to believe that he could actually do

297
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,560
 what we believe that he could do.

298
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,320
 That we actually believe that he could answer the prayers that we're currently praying.

299
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,440
 And this is why this doxology for me is so challenging because I have to reflect on my

300
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,800
 own faith and ask, "Do I really believe that God could do even just what I'm praying, let

301
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,080
 alone immeasurably more?

302
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,640
 I just need to get through the first part of the equation here."

303
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,760
 If you're anything like me, there's been seasons in your life and maybe you're in one of those

304
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,880
 seasons right now where you're actually struggling to believe that God can answer your prayers.

305
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,160
 You're actually honestly struggling to believe that he could really come through with a vision

306
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,840
 or a hope or a dream that you might have.

307
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,680
 When that happens, maybe you haven't given up on your relationship with God, but here's

308
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
 what happens.

309
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:08,440
 You end up settling for worshipping what I would argue is the not enough God.

310
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,960
 No, you still believe in Jesus.

311
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,720
 You still come to church every Sunday.

312
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,040
 But because perhaps your prayers haven't been answered on a regular basis.

313
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,460
 Perhaps you took that step of faith out into a business venture and it didn't work out.

314
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,960
 Perhaps you invited that person out on a date and they said no.

315
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,880
 Perhaps you tried to do something in faith and you felt and you had all your prayer partners

316
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,880
 there, everybody prayed, everybody said, "Yeah, this is what you should do."

317
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,880
 And you took that big step of faith and it didn't work out and that hurt.

318
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,280
 And you felt a little bit let down by God and you felt like God was on mute in your

319
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
 life.

320
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,600
 And because that was so painful, because it was so public and you had done that step of

321
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,000
 faith, you've actually kind of stepped back from that and you've said, "I don't know if

322
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,040
 God does always answer prayers because he hasn't always answered mine.

323
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:00,160
 I still believe in him, but I'm not sure if he's really enough."

324
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,780
 And so some of us get stuck on the first side of the equation here because we're actually

325
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,280
 worshipping the not enough God.

326
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,240
 And maybe we never would have put a label on it until today, but if you're honest with

327
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,240
 yourself, you know you're part of that camp.

328
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,300
 God is just not enough for me.

329
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,000
 The good news is I think that most of us kind of push through that reality at some point

330
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,080
 in our lives and we end up then worshipping what I would call the just enough God.

331
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,160
 And the just enough God sounds a lot better than the not enough God, but it is still a

332
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,000
 deficient God that we worship.

333
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,560
 The just enough God is the God that actually does answer the prayers that we pray and does

334
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,320
 come through for the dreams that we hold.

335
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,060
 I mean, track with this.

336
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,860
 If I had said to you that there is a church in Hong Kong where everybody in that church

337
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,100
 believes that God answers prayers and God comes through on dreams, I think you'd want

338
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,220
 to be a part of that church, amen?

339
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,620
 Wouldn't you want to go to a church where everybody in that church actually believes

340
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:06,140
 that Jesus answers prayers, actually believes that God has visions and dreams and those

341
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,900
 things can actually happen in the world?

342
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,260
 Wouldn't that be an amazingly exciting church to be a part of?

343
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,140
 It would, but it would be a church that's worshipping the wrong God.

344
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,560
 If I was to say to you at the beginning of this sermon that God could answer every single

345
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,500
 prayer you've ever prayed and come through for every dream that you could ever dream

346
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,780
 and are you happy to worship that God, I'm sure all of us would have said, "Sign me up

347
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,660
 on the bottom line.

348
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,860
 That's the God I want to worship, amen?"

349
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,180
 We think so, yes.

350
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,540
 In fact, we think that that's the very definition of what it means to be a Christian.

351
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,180
 "Oh man, I'm a Christian.

352
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,900
 I actually believe that God can answer prayer.

353
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,700
 I actually believe that He does come through in dreams.

354
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,020
 I mean, that's what I'm supposed to believe, right?

355
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
 I do believe.

356
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,740
 My level of faith is at that level."

357
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,140
 And we think that that's right and Paul comes and says, "If that's what you believe, you're

358
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,340
 still worshipping the wrong God.

359
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,380
 You're worshipping the wrong God because you have limited Him still to what you're praying

360
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,740
 for and what you're believing in.

361
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,580
 And even though His Spirit is at work in those things, as he's just said, His power is at

362
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,060
 work in you.

363
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,820
 If you limit God to just answering your prayers and just coming through for your dreams, you've

364
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,300
 still created a ceiling for God.

365
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,380
 You've still placed Him in your box.

366
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,260
 It's still a God of your truth."

367
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,460
 And Paul wants to pull his church broader and bigger than that.

368
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,860
 And he's saying, "You've got to worship not the not enough God, not the just enough God.

369
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:40,620
 The God that He calls us to worship is," really long word that takes ages to write, "the immeasurably

370
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,300
 more God."

371
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,940
 He's like, "This is the God that you are to worship."

372
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,820
 Man that's bad writing, but you know what I'm trying to say.

373
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,660
 That looks like the immeasurably mowed God.

374
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,700
 No, He's not the immeasurably mowed.

375
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,700
 He's like, "This is the God."

376
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,140
 Like, if there's a God you are to believe in your church, it's not just one that's limited

377
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,980
 to the ceiling of what you can pray and what you can believe for, even though you can pray

378
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,180
 and believe for some great stuff.

379
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,500
 No, He's always bigger, always greater, always more vast.

380
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,380
 His ways are always higher than our ways.

381
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,580
 And if you're going to worship a God, you worship the immeasurably more God.

382
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,100
 The one who can do way more than you could ever ask or imagine.

383
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,140
 The one who can take a 25-year-old French girl who has never stood foot in a church

384
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,180
 before and so fill her with the love of Christ that she would come forward and say, "What

385
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,020
 is going on here?"

386
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:37,140
 And God could save her because that's what God does.

387
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,580
 We never prayed for that.

388
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,060
 We never asked for that.

389
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,100
 I want to be honest with you.

390
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,180
 I don't think we ever had the faith for that until it happened.

391
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,420
 God is the immeasurably more God.

392
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,580
 Now that becomes our ceiling.

393
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,940
 I expect that now at the Vine.

394
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,620
 By the way, if you're a stranger in this room, welcome.

395
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,740
 It's good to have you with us.

396
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
 You're about to get saved.

397
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,740
 It's awesome.

398
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,340
 We're so glad you're here.

399
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,300
 That's now my ceiling, but now God's light.

400
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,300
 You've got to believe for more than that then because he's always the immeasurably more God.

401
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,300
 Are you with me?

402
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,860
 Are you tracking with this?

403
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,980
 Now then Paul finishes everything that he's saying.

404
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,040
 He finishes it by saying there's a third element.

405
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,220
 He said, "Then there's this reality of the church."

406
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,580
 I love this.

407
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,260
 And he says, "The church, when God is the immeasurably more God and the church worships

408
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,060
 the immeasurably more God," he says, "then glory is seen in that church."

409
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,620
 Isn't that beautiful?

410
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,900
 It's almost as if a church has limited itself to either the not enough God or the just enough

411
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,940
 God, then it's going to be lacking the glory of Christ in it.

412
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,180
 If you want the church to see and to feel and reveal the glory of Christ, then we have

413
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,300
 to worship the immeasurably more God.

414
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,860
 Because when you worship the immeasurably more God, his glory, Paul says, is seen in

415
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,300
 the church.

416
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:59,220
 It's seen in the church because when that French lady stood in front of a room of this

417
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,180
 size and shared the story that I shared with you, I mean it was hopefully impactful when

418
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,900
 I shared it, could you imagine when she shared it?

419
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:16,180
 Worship on that Sunday in this place was just off the records, off the charts.

420
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,980
 Because glory was seen in the church.

421
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,580
 And why was it glory?

422
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,800
 Because the church could not take any credit for it.

423
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:29,420
 It happens and everybody stood back and said, "Only God could have done that."

424
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,580
 And if only God could have done it, we worship that God.

425
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:39,140
 We're not worshiping a platform or a speaker or a type of worship or a preacher, we're

426
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:45,460
 worshiping God because that could only have ever happened by one who is able to do immeasurably

427
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,100
 more than we could ever ask or imagine.

428
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,620
 And when we see it take place, how can glory not be seen in the church?

429
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,580
 How can the church not respond in saying, "Praise God, you are glorified," as Paul said,

430
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:05,260
 "in Christ Jesus," that the works of Christ are raised in the midst.

431
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:15,200
 The way that a church can glory God is simply by providing an arena in which that the work

432
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,740
 of Jesus Christ can take effect.

433
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,020
 That's how a church glorifies God.

434
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:31,140
 It actually gets out of the way and enables Christ to do His work.

435
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,300
 And that's what we want to do here today.

436
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,020
 And as much as it was important for you to understand what Paul's finishing his prayers

437
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,060
 with here, and I hope as we've mapped it out for you, it's inspired you and challenged

438
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,180
 you, but the reason why we've done it here this morning is because of what it leads us

439
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,520
 to.

440
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,700
 It leads us to actually providing an arena in which the work of Jesus Christ can actually

441
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,900
 take effect amongst us.

442
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,500
 For quite some time now as a community of leaders here, we've been praying for this

443
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,180
 Sunday and we've been praying for this Sunday because we knew that we were going to be setting

444
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,900
 aside time now for prayer and ministry.

445
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,500
 We want to actually lean into the radical idea of the immeasurably more God that is

446
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,260
 amongst us.

447
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,140
 What we're going to do in a moment is I'm going to invite you all to stand and we've

448
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:23,860
 been praying for what are some things that we can pray for you for and lay hands on you.

449
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:29,660
 Our elders, our pastoral team, our prayer, innocences and prayer ministry team have prepared

450
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,140
 themselves for today.

451
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,700
 And what's going to happen is we're going to name a couple of things that we feel the

452
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,720
 Holy Spirit wants to minister to our people in today.

453
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,320
 And if that resonates for you, we're going to ask you to have the courage today.

454
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,440
 If you're in this room, if you're in the lower house here to come and stand here at the front

455
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,500
 in the middle.

456
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,480
 If you're in the upper house, we have space at the front set aside today for this.

457
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,040
 You can come and stand at the front in the upper house.

458
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,480
 If it gets too busy up there, then you can actually come down to here as well.

459
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,140
 But there is a prayer team with elders up there as well.

460
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,760
 If you're in the overflow today, you can come inside here for prayer.

461
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,560
 If you're online, you can contribute in this as well.

462
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,700
 You can send your prayers to us at prayer@thevine.org.hk.

463
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,600
 And we would love to be able to pray with you in this moment as well.

464
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,940
 But we're going to take some time to actually put what we've been preaching into practice.

465
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,800
 God is able to do immeasurably more than you could ever ask and imagine.

466
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,360
 And as I was praying and preparing for this ministry time, I felt God say this to me,

467
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,800
 "Andrew, there are things that I want to do in this church that you have yet asked for

468
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,700
 or thought about.

469
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,320
 You haven't even asked or thought about them yet.

470
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,840
 There are things that I want to do in this church that you haven't yet even thought about

471
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
 or asked for."

472
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,160
 And as he spoke that to me, I felt like he was speaking it to you.

473
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,400
 And I want to speak this over you.

474
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,960
 There are some things that God wants to do in you that you have yet asked for or even

475
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,120
 thought about.

476
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,560
 And we're going to make the space for that to happen now.

477
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
 So let me start in prayer.

478
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,640
 Father, we are so grateful.

479
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,920
 So grateful that Paul would write to his church to challenge them to have a belief in a God

480
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,120
 who is not the not enough God or the just enough God, but the immeasurably more God.

481
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,600
 And that's the God that we here at The Vine, that's what we believe in.

482
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,780
 And that's the God that we're now going to pray to and believe for on behalf of the people

483

00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,200
 Lord, I thank you that no one is here by mistake this afternoon.

00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,280
 And Lord, you love these people so deeply and so intimately and so completely.

486
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,480
 And what a privilege it is now that we get to lay our hands on one another and to pray

487
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,400
 in faith for healing and restoration and release from anything that is physically ailing the

00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
 people in this room.

489
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,800
 And we thank you for that.
