1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
 - Good morning, church.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,460
 It's good to see you.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,300
 I know there's a lot of you watching from different places,

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,420
 so I know you're there,

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,040
 and so thank you for joining us this morning.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,480
 Church, I want to start by recapping our last two weeks

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,800
 from the Advent series.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,560
 In week one, we talked about the call

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,940
 and that there's 400 years of silence,

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,020
 people's hearts got hardened,

11
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,640
 and no one expected Jesus to come, but he did.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,040
 And Andrew focused on the call of repentance,

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,840
 which is a call to turn around,

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,460
 to reorientate yourself in a new direction,

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,440
 and it speaks more of action

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,940
 and more than just a confession.

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,600
 And John the Baptist shows us that Advent is a call

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,320
 to personal renewal as well as social reversal.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,340
 Last week, which you probably remember,

20
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,880
 we talked about this beautiful place called the desert,

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,920
 and we focused on the wilderness

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,080
 and how that it plays a central role

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,720
 in the Old Testament biblical narrative,

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,840
 and this is where God most revealed himself to his people,

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,040
 and he did it through a process in the wilderness

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,000
 through intimacy, through teaching, and through healing.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,340
 Also, we just dwelled on the fact that Advent is a time

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,320
 for us to redefine our own wilderness,

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,020
 from a place of isolation to a place where we can meet God.

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,320
 And we must remember that this is the coolest thing,

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,880
 that there is fruit in the desert,

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,160
 and that God will stop at nothing in our wilderness

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,160
 to shape and refine us so that we could be fully alive in him.

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,320
 And so before I start, I have a disclaimer to make.

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,440
 Although we are gonna be talking about baptisms,

36
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,880
 my intention, for those of you who are already baptized,

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,160
 whether in November or you got baptized earlier,

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,360
 I do not wanna cause any one of you to second doubt

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,120
 or second guess your baptism, right?

40
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,160
 The fact that you got baptism, that's good.

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,840
 Now, for those of you who have not gone baptized yet,

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,400
 every year we run a few courses throughout the year

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,720
 where you can learn more about baptism,

44
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,200
 and hopefully it'll help you make an informed decision

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
 on whether to get baptized or not.

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,840
 So there's more information on that.

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,100
 So in the last two months,

48
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,660
 I've been preparing to share with you today,

49
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,200
 and three things came to mind

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,000
 that I wanna bring to your attention,

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,920
 and these things hinder our faith and hinder our growth,

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,000
 and they are distractions, they are hurries,

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,880
 and they are desires.

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,280
 And so I just want you to reflect

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,720
 on whether these things impact your faith or not.

56
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,800
 So church, I wanna ask you,

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,680
 how often do you get distracted from what you need to do

58
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
 and are called to do?

59
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,080
 Think about Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane,

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,160
 and how many times did Jesus have to ask his disciples

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,120
 to stay focused and to just pray with him?

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,280
 Because often there is so much going on,

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,460
 not just externally, but internally in us,

64
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,080
 that our hearts and our focus gets divided.

65
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,000
 Let me ask you another thing.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,600
 How often are you hurrying from one thing to another,

67
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,200
 one place to another, from one conversation to another?

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,280
 Lately I'm realizing that hurry

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,880
 is one of the greatest enemies to our spirituality,

70
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,280
 because we simply cannot do what Jesus asks of us

71
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,960
 in a hurry.

72
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,540
 We cannot follow him to a quiet place in a hurry.

73
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,640
 We cannot build meaningful relationships in a hurry.

74
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,620
 We cannot listen to what God wants to say to us in a hurry.

75
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,640
 And lastly, I want you to think about this, church.

76
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,880
 How often do you experience a perpetual restlessness

77
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,580
 within your heart that you can't get rid of?

78
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,940
 As humans, we have desires, and they drive and motivate us,

79
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,520
 and we get stuff done, which is great.

80
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,920
 But the tension arises when we realize

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,720
 that we're actually finite beings.

82
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,180
 That means we have limitations,

83
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,180
 but yet our hearts desire infinitely so much stuff.

84
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,200
 And what happens then?

85
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,760
 We experience this thing called restlessness.

86
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,800
 We can't stay still, and no matter how much we see,

87
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,680
 no matter how much we do, buy, sell, eat, drink,

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,280
 experience, visit, travel, we always want more.

89
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,840
 We can't seem to satisfy that.

90
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,680
 And we do try to satisfy that.

91
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,200
 We try to manage that ourselves,

92
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,600
 but then we're led down this path of more anxiety,

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,440
 of depression, of burnout, of materialism,

94
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,260
 of sin, idolatry.

95
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,780
 We form these unhealthy habits and attachments to things,

96
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,020
 all as a way of us trying to address our restlessness

97
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,400
 that actually only God can satisfy.

98
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,040
 And we continue to spiral

99
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,520
 unless we encounter some kind of intervention.

100
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,560
 And so the danger and consequence of being distracted,

101
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,640
 of hurrying, letting our desires consume us,

102
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,800
 is how easily we remove ourselves from God's presence

103
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,780
 and out of his speaking range.

104
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,440
 Our manic lifestyles, whether you realize it or not,

105
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,960
 disconnects and actually threatens our connection

106
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,220
 with our living God.

107
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,400
 And of course, God knows we've done,

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,480
 we've tried everything we can to fix this and to help this,

109
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,720
 but perhaps our solution to these states

110
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 that we find ourselves in isn't found in reduction

111
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,560
 or in elimination, but rather in a redirection

112
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,480
 to what God has for us.

113
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,840
 Church, in this period of Advent,

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,100
 God redirects our attention back to him,

115
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,680
 back to what he's saying,

116
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,920
 back to what is most important to him.

117
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,960
 He directs the church, that is us,

118
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,160
 to reflect on our readiness

119
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,400
 and to anticipate his son, his second coming,

120
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,240
 but more importantly and just as important,

121
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,480
 God redirects our attention to remind us

122
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,240
 that Jesus is already with us,

123
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,200
 he's already present in our life right now.

124
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,120
 And God reminds us that he has given us the spirit

125
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,320
 so that we don't have to walk each day alone

126
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,580
 or without any help.

127
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,720
 So church, this morning, I just want to let God address you.

128
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,160
 I want him to, I've been praying

129
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,380
 that he would show you something about himself

130
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,200
 or that he would just remind you of something

131
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,760
 that he wants you just to remember,

132
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,020
 just to continue to work in,

133
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,040
 something he wants to encourage you in,

134
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,300
 something he wants to comfort you in.

135
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,520
 And as Andrew said, God does not condemn.

136
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,960
 He reminds us because he loves us.

137
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,700
 And so today, as we talk about the baptism,

138
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,400
 we're not gonna go verse by verse as we're used to.

139
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,600
 I would like to share God's desire,

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,200
 his heart for the church that is us

141
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,400
 and what it means to be baptized.

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,700
 And so I pray that God would reveal this to you today.

143
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,680
 So church, I'm just gonna pray for us.

144
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,980
 So would you pray with me?

145
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:57,000
 Lord, I have done my humanly best to prepare for today.

146
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,420
 And only you, Lord, can say what you want to say

147
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,600
 to each of my family members listening, wherever they are.

148
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,500
 So Lord, I surrender this morning to you

149
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,280
 and I trust that you will speak

150
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,640
 because I will say a lot of things this morning,

151
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,320
 but I pray that you would just say that one thing

152
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,420
 to each person as they need it

153
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,920
 and that it would change them, it would form them,

154
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,320
 it would transform them.

155
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,680
 And you are with us.

156
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,520
 Lord, thank you, in your name we pray, amen.

157
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,280
 So with that, we are gonna jump into our passage today.

158
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,680
 We're in Mark chapter one, verse one to eight.

159
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,320
 Please read with me.

160
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,880
 The beginning of the good news about Jesus,

161
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,440
 the Messiah, the Son of God,

162
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,840
 as it is written in Isaiah the prophet.

163
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,000
 I will send my messenger ahead of you

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,800
 who will prepare your way,

165
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,140
 a voice of one calling the wilderness.

166
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,040
 Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.

167
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,240
 And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness

168
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,980
 preaching a baptism of repentance

169
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,700
 for the forgiveness of sins.

170
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,360
 The whole Judean countryside

171
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,360
 and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him,

172
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,500
 confessing their sins.

173
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,240
 They were baptized by him in the river Jordan.

174
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,480
 John wore clothing made of camel's hair

175
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,220
 with a leather belt around his waist

176
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,000
 and he ate locusts and wild honey.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,480
 And this was his message.

178
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,600
 After me comes one more powerful than I,

179
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,280
 the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy

180
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,240
 to stoop down and untie.

181
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,040
 I baptize you with water,

182
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,580
 but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.

183
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,480
 This passage marks the beginning

184
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,800
 of how Jesus became the Messiah

185
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,160
 and how he was introduced.

186
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,560
 And it starts with the Old Testament prophecy from Isaiah

187
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,680
 and how John the Baptist was the fulfillment of that.

188
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,700
 And John's ministry really was to preach

189
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,320
 and to prepare God's people,

190
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,640
 prepare their heart to say that the Messiah will come.

191
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,820
 You just have to wait, you just have to be ready.

192
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,040
 And so in this passage,

193
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,120
 John's preaching represents God's calling,

194
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,840
 us out of the wilderness, out of our distractions,

195
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,360
 out of our busyness and hurrying and restlessness

196
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,040
 to receive the baptism of repentance

197
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,320
 for the forgiveness of sins

198
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,960
 and the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

199
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,680
 So this morning I want to spend time

200
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,760
 unpacking the significance of each baptism

201
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,720
 and why it is important for us as believers

202
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
 to receive or to know about these baptisms.

203
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,640
 In verse four, John the Baptist appears in the wilderness

204
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,520
 and begins preaching about the baptism of repentance

205
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,200
 for the forgiveness of sins.

206
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,440
 And so here are a few but brief thoughts

207
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,960
 on the significance of this water baptism.

208
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,600
 So let's start in the Old Testament.

209
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
 Wherever there is water imagery,

210
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,400
 it is typically alludes to the presence

211
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,920
 and the work of God's spirit.

212
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,480
 And of course in the New Testament,

213
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,240
 Jesus too uses water to describe the cleansing

214
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,840
 and renewing work of the Holy Spirit.

215
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,840
 And so to baptize is a verb that means to immerse.

216
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,240
 And so baptism as we understand it

217
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,680
 as from a church perspective

218
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,000
 and what we've been practicing

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,320
 all of these years and generations

220
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,160
 is baptism is the practice of immersing someone

221
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,600
 into the water.

222
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,440
 And by doing this, it represents a symbolic

223
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,760
 and a spiritual act of being born again,

224
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,800
 of being cleansed, being renewed,

225
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,480
 being resurrected with Christ in a new identity with him

226
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,360
 to have a new beginning in this life with God.

227
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,600
 And that's what we witness all the time.

228
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,720
 And so church, each of us will most likely

229
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,000
 just get baptized once in our lifetime

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 as the physical, symbolic and spiritual declaration

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
 of our faith just as I've mentioned.

232
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,240
 And for majority of us, once is really enough.

233
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,560
 But within the heart and the idea behind baptism

234
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,480
 is the spiritual posturing of our own heart

235
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,160
 that has invaluable benefits in this life with Christ

236
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,240
 and the life to come.

237
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,240
 And so church, today I want us to ask God this,

238
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,720
 Lord, what does it mean to be baptized by you?

239
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,960
 What does it mean to be immersed by you

240
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,640
 and with you each day of our lives as your children?

241
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,560
 How does this look like?

242
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,240
 What must change in my heart for me to receive

243
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,440
 both these baptisms as a posturing of my heart,

244
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,880
 as my act of worship?

245
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,240
 Lord, I'm tired.

246
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
 This is for some of us.

247
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,960
 If we're tired, we're a bit cynical,

248
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,760
 we're a bit apathetic to this faith.

249
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,320
 We've been around for so long.

250
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,280
 How can I still receive the baptism

251
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,760
 that you have for me today?

252
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,000
 And so within the call to be baptized

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,040
 is a personal invitation to you to be transformed,

254
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,880
 to be renewed, to be immersed by God himself

255
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,980
 in his love as our way of life every single day.

256
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,080
 This is our spiritual journey.

257
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,560
 This is something we go on for the rest of our life.

258
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,080
 And that's our heart's cry when we want to be baptized.

259
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,340
 We're saying, Lord, I wanna be baptized by you.

260
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,240
 I want you to lead me out of my wilderness.

261
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,000
 I wanna follow you wherever you are.

262
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,880
 I want you to bring me into the second birth.

263
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,680
 I want you to show me how your kingdom works,

264
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,960
 what the culture is like, what you value,

265
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,560
 what you say, because all those things I want

266
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,080
 and I want to learn to follow you.

267
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,820
 In verses four to five, as John the Baptist

268
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,220
 preaches about the baptism of repentance,

269
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,500
 a lot of people listen, right?

270
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,660
 They went to him, they responded to his message,

271
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,300
 they confessed their sins and were baptized

272
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,140
 by him in the River Jordan.

273
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,200
 I want to take a more detailed look now

274
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,060
 at what it means to respond in forgiveness,

275
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,140
 repentance, and confession.

276
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,980
 I believe all these men and women

277
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,860
 that came from everywhere heard John the Baptist

278
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,100
 preach the good news to them.

279
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,920
 John gave them an opportunity,

280
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,260
 perhaps, to acknowledge that, you know what?

281
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,880
 Yeah, life is difficult, life is tragic,

282
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,020
 but you know what?

283
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,380
 Out of the wilderness, graciously, divine,

284
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,140
 God divinely calls us out of our wilderness.

285
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,940
 God shows us another way.

286
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,460
 God shows us that the Messiah will come

287
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,120
 and he's not just gonna change our lives,

288
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,220
 but he's gonna change the reality,

289
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,340
 our very understanding of reality

290
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,920
 and everything that's attached to it

291
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,820
 through his son and what's gonna happen on the cross

292
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,540
 and the days after the cross.

293
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,780
 I think John there would have alluded

294
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,060
 to God forgiving us as well as the gospel.

295
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,920
 When we're baptized, we can start again

296
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,260
 because we're forgiven, we know that we're forgiven.

297
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,060
 We are released from all the cages that hinders us,

298
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,260
 our hate, our self-hate, our anger,

299
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,700
 our sin, our guilt, our shame, whatever it is.

300
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,260
 We find out that forgiveness is not just a feeling,

301
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,960
 but it's a decision.

302
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,120
 The good news is that God made a decision to forgive us.

303
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,380
 He continues to extend his forgiveness

304
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,700
 and his grace to us each day

305
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,500
 and as we receive it, we are healed, we are liberated,

306
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,940
 we are reconciled with God as well as each other.

307
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,540
 And church, I wanna share the greatest news

308
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,700
 about forgiveness.

309
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,540
 Forgiveness removes any barriers between God and us,

310
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,700
 whether they're emotional, physical, mental, spiritual,

311
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,020
 and forgiveness also just opens up the possibility

312
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,600
 for a relationship to flourish.

313
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,000
 As Christians, then, we are commanded,

314
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,840
 not commanded, I wanna stress that word.

315
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,280
 We're commanded also to forgive one another

316
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,660
 because we are gonna hurt each other,

317
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,400
 we're gonna offend each other,

318
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,480
 in the same way God forgives us

319
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,760
 so that others may too release and experience

320
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,040
 God's love and God's grace and his forgiveness through us.

321
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,640
 Now, when we hear God calling us,

322
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,620
 we can really only respond by repentance.

323
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,980
 According to scripture, it is only through repentance

324
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,500
 that we can come into God's kingdom.

325
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,200
 Repentance is an action where we make a decision

326
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,500
 to change maybe our way of thinking

327
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,540
 and our current trajectory of where we are going

328
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,780
 and want to go.

329
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,240
 But to change requires humbleness,

330
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,400
 it requires a humility, it requires a willingness to listen.

331
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,500
 And these men and women listened and they heard,

332
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,460
 and what they heard, they yearned,

333
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,960
 they knew that they wanted it,

334
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,900
 so they gave up everything and they said,

335
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,860
 "Yes, we want this."

336
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,800
 I think repentance also means that

337
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,400
 there's nothing you can do for yourself

338
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,920
 and that you recognize that

339
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,640
 and you wanna change your thinking.

340
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,520
 One of my favorite spiritual teachers, Bruce Demiris,

341
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,100
 and I've been really thinking about his words

342
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,800
 in the last few months, and I wanna read you this quote.

343
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,460
 He says, "The truth is, we will never change

344
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,460
 "unless we're sufficiently challenged with new ideas."

345
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,800
 I think this baptism John the Baptist was preaching

346
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,940
 was this new radical idea.

347
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,160
 God calls us what to himself?

348
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,900
 They've never heard of something like this.

349
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,320
 As growing Christians, we must learn, too,

350
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,200
 to be receptive to change, to fresh insight,

351
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,000
 to new leadings into unexplored spiritual territory,

352
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,440
 or else we do miss out on finding true life

353
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,200
 and our true selves with Christ.

354
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,160
 And so our spiritual journey,

355
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,600
 wherever we are in this journey,

356
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,120
 requires always an openness to change,

357
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,800
 and that's called repentance.

358
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,140
 And so if we're willing to receive the forgiveness,

359
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,380
 we're willing to repent and be open-minded,

360
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,520
 we also respond by confession.

361
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,700
 Our confession is a way of declaring with our words,

362
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,540
 but also with action, and we're committing ourselves

363
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,660
 to live another way, and that is his way.

364
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,500
 And so when we confess, we say something like this.

365
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,100
 I confess and choose to turn away from the sin,

366
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,980
 the idolatry, the anxieties, the fears,

367
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,260
 all the things that cause us to be unfaithful

368
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,300
 to you and to each other.

369
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,940
 I no longer want to be a slave to these things.

370
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,860
 I want to be free, as you say that I can be free.

371
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,420
 Lord, in all of these areas that I've offended you,

372
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,140
 I've offended my brother and sister,

373
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,280
 would you forgive me and allow me to start again

374
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,200
 by removing this barrier between us and between us?

375
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,260
 And wherever you are, I confess that's where I want to be.

376
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,580
 Whatever you say, I want to learn to do,

377
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,540
 so bring me into your green pastures,

378
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,380
 into your still waters.

379
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,380
 And so by our confession, God redirects every aspect of us

380
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,420
 into a better way of thinking,

381
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,660
 in a better way of living with him.

382
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,500
 And so, so far, I want to summarize

383
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,980
 what I've been talking about in the last 15 minutes.

384
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,740
 The heart and intention behind baptism

385
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,600
 is a daily invitation into a lifelong journey

386
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,680
 out of the wilderness with our God.

387
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,180
 As we respond to our living God that calls us,

388
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,060
 we reestablish, we rebuild, we reconnect

389
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,420
 these connections, these relationships.

390
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,340
 And as we journey with God, he teaches us what to focus on,

391
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,660
 what to grow in, how to love, how to forgive,

392
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,700
 all of these things we might have missed in our first life.

393
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,300
 And in living, in following Christ,

394
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,060
 we find our meaning, our purpose, our satisfaction,

395
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,580
 and our way of life as Christians.

396
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,220
 So from here on, I want to now think about,

397
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,560
 for us to think about the baptism of the Holy Spirit

398
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,620
 and how this comes into the grand picture

399
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,900
 in the narrative of us journeying with God

400
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,580
 out of the wilderness.

401
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,620
 And I just want to make one more disclaimer, okay,

402
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,600
 last one for today, about the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

403
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,340
 For many of us, I think, if we grew up

404
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,380
 in the charismatic denomination or tradition,

405
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,340
 the word baptism of the Holy Spirit

406
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,860
 actually comes with a lot of baggage.

407
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,640
 At least for me, it does.

408
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,660
 Many immediately, you know, I think of receiving tongues,

409
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,860
 receiving all the spiritual gifts all at once,

410
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,780
 or experiencing some kind of really dramatic thing

411
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,540
 that we read about in Acts.

412
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,580
 I want to reassure you that my heart today for us

413
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,420
 is not to do that, although we can do that some other time,

414
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,140
 but maybe not this morning.

415
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,820
 But I want to clarify this for you.

416
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,180
 I want to clarify that the Spirit of God comes to us

417
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,420
 as believers when we first believe and confess Christ

418
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,660
 at the first point of salvation.

419
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,500
 So what I have to say now about the baptism of the Spirit

420
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,180
 is an additional aspect, an additional dimension

421
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,680
 to our salvation, to our baptism, and our faith.

422
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,620
 So in verse seven, John the Baptist says

423
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,340
 that there is someone coming who is more superior,

424
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,700
 who's more powerful than himself.

425
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,260
 And in verse eight, John says the one who is to come

426
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,420
 will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.

427
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,860
 So what does this baptism look like and mean?

428
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,620
 Mark makes a very important contrast

429
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,820
 between the water baptism here

430
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,980
 and the baptism of God's Spirit,

431
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,380
 in that water baptism in of itself is inadequate.

432
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,660
 That means it is not enough, church,

433
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,000
 to be baptized in water alone,

434
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,720
 because in our hearts, in our spirits,

435
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,340
 what we truly need and yearn for

436
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,660
 is to receive the very presence of God himself.

437
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,100
 And as Christians, the good news is that we are promised

438
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,500
 and given the indwelling presence of God.

439
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,560
 By his Spirit, we become more connected to him,

440
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,780
 we're able to hear him,

441
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,840
 and we allow ourselves to be satisfied by him.

442
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,580
 We are created, God intended us to be created

443
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,020
 to be in a strong and genuine encounter and dialogue

444
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,260
 and a conversation with him every single day,

445
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,140
 and this is only possible because of the Spirit.

446
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,300
 And so the baptism of the Holy Spirit

447
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,780
 reminds us fundamentally every single day

448
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,060
 that apart from him, without him, we can do no good thing.

449
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,920
 We can do nothing.

450
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,600
 It is not us, ultimately, who moves us in this journey.

451
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,760
 It is not us that brings about the change

452
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,300
 that we pray and yearn for.

453
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,740
 It is God's Spirit and what he's doing alone.

454
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,820
 It's his presence in our life that allows us to do that.

455
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,020
 And so, church, we are also incomplete

456
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,140
 until we welcome the Spirit

457
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,660
 and allow him to initiate our growth,

458
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,980
 to allow him to liberate us from bondage,

459
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,460
 to allow him to heal us of our woundedness

460
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,140
 and our brokenness,

461
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,180
 allow him to cleanse us of the uncleanliness,

462
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,440
 and to really allow him to make us whole

463
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,140
 in the personhood of Christ.

464
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,300
 And this is only possible when we say,

465
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,300
 yes, Lord, immerse me in not just forgiveness,

466
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,060
 but in your Spirit every single day,

467
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,140
 or else, otherwise, I can do nothing and I am incomplete.

468
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,900
 And church, one more thing that I want to say

469
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,700
 about the Spirit is that Jesus says

470
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,980
 that there will be a time where many will claim

471
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,260
 to be like Christ.

472
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,780
 They will be claimed, meaning that they are Jesus,

473
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,820
 and they will do Christ-like things,

474
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,580
 and they will deceive many people.

475
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,940
 And Jesus says there will be a day

476
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,180
 when there will be sheep dressed up as sheep's clothing,

477
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,580
 and they will deceive and lead the children of God astray.

478
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,100
 And Jesus points to a day

479
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,980
 where the truth is gonna be undermined,

480
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,760
 and that the truth will be severely twisted

481
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,500
 to serve other selfish gains.

482
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,020
 And church, we already live in this day.

483
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,500
 As Jesus says in John 16, verse 13,

484
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,020
 he says, "The Spirit of truth has come,

485
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,060
 "and he will guide us into all truth."

486
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,260
 This, I share this because this is good news.

487
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,940
 God gives us the Spirit, and he immerses us in the Spirit

488
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,660
 so that we will not be easily deceived.

489
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,860
 He will give us the Spirit, which is a compass

490
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,600
 that will continually speak and remind us

491
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,460
 and to encourage us and to comfort us,

492
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,700
 and ultimately, to point us to the truth,

493
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,320
 point us to what is still good and true in this world.

494
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
 And no matter how dark it gets,

495
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
 we will still have a compass

496
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,380
 that leads us back into his presence,

497
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,220
 where we can continue to live in the fullness

498
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,380
 of what he intended.

499
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,700
 So church, the baptism of the Holy Spirit

500
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,800
 is the most glorious treasure

501
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,640
 we will ever possess in this life,

502
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,340
 and because that is the very presence of yourself.

503
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,340
 And so our response to the baptism of the Holy Spirit

504
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,780
 is to know that our daily worship,

505
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,680
 our daily response is to host the presence of God,

506
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,420
 is to make room in our hearts,

507
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,300
 is to welcome him every single day and say,

508
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,880
 "Lord, if you do not come, I am incomplete.

509
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,900
 "If you do not come, I will continue to ask you

510
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,720
 "and invite you to come.

511
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,160
 "Whatever I do, wherever I am, whatever season,

512
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,500
 "whatever wilderness, desert, just be with me, Lord.

513
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,720
 "I, I, sit with me.

514
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,080
 "I wanna sit with you."

515
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,060
 You know, recently, church, we've experienced history,

516
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,540
 not just this year, but recently,

517
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,140
 we were able to baptize our brothers and sisters

518
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,780
 in the Vine Church, first ever historic in-house baptism

519
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,220
 that took place on November 8th for the entire Sunday,

520
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,620
 and I know a lot of you were there.

521
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,020
 And I'm just grateful that the Spirit of God

522
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,900
 inspires us to do such things,

523
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,660
 and I do wanna just thank you for everyone

524
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,780
 that spearheaded that, you know who you are.

525
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,740
 And, and just to be able to do what we as a church

526
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,220
 are called to do, which is to see others baptized,

527
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,740
 to see people immersed in God's presence.

528
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,620
 And I had time to actually read over a lot

529
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,060
 of the testimonies that were written

530
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,700
 by our brothers and sisters that day,

531
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,120
 and I want to just sum up.

532
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,100
 I don't have enough time to go through every one,

533
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,900
 but I wanna sum up the general, unique journey

534
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,460
 that each brother and sister took,

535
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,260
 and that they moved from a place of desolation,

536
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,740
 a place of isolation, the wilderness, the desert,

537
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,900
 to a place where, you know what, things are not perfect,

538
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,380
 they're not completely healed,

539
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,700
 but they got to a place where they could breathe again,

540
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,180
 where they could actually hear their thoughts again,

541
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,060
 where they could be liberated,

542
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,220
 where they had a new perspective,

543
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,500
 that they felt free to love and to speak

544
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,420
 and to know and that they're not alone.

545
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,340
 And so this is the journey of baptism,

546
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,180
 this is the posturing of our heart,

547
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,180
 and all these men and women before us,

548
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,980
 on Sunday, November 8th, they said,

549
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,420
 we found the way, and I declare and I confess,

550
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,340
 this is the way I wanna continue to live from now on,

551
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,140
 with our God leading us.

552
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,540
 And so I wanna share this quote

553
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,180
 from a philosopher, theologian, Martin Buber,

554
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,620
 and I feel like he sums up this baptism,

555
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,460
 our baptism journey, and also our reality,

556
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,860
 our shared reality as Christians.

557
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,140
 He says, "God is no object of discourse,

558
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,180
 "knowledge, or even experience.

559
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,420
 "He cannot be spoken of, but He can be spoken to.

560
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,100
 "He cannot be seen, but He can be listened to.

561
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,580
 "The only possible relationship with God

562
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,740
 "is to address Him and to be addressed by Him,

563
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,220
 "here and now."

564
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,900
 Church, this describes the Christian life

565
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,980
 that all of us are on,

566
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,740
 and the beauty of being addressed by God,

567
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,380
 and for us to address God and to listen to God,

568
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,820
 you know, it's not without struggles,

569
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,220
 but it is what it is, and this is the beautiful gospel,

570
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,540
 this is the life that all of us are called to.

571
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:47,500
 And for me, each day, when I live out this baptism,

572
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,900
 each day is a new opportunity for me

573
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,380
 to call out to God in my wilderness

574
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,500
 of being distracted, of hurrying, of busyness,

575
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,500
 of misplaced desires, of idolatry, of sin, and anger.

576
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,220
 You know, each day I cry out to God,

577
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,540
 and I say, "Lord, I don't wanna live like this anymore.

578
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,660
 "I can't live like this.

579
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,660
 "I can't bear to live like this,

580
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,180
 "so would you show me another way?

581
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,300
 "I don't mind pain, I don't mind the suffer,

582
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,940
 "but just show me another way.

583
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,100
 "Walk with me just through today.

584
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,580
 "That's what I'm asking for, Lord."

585
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,780
 And each day, I'm so forgetful, I just pray one thing.

586
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,140
 I say, "Lord, may I go through this day not to forget you,

587
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,820
 "not to know that you sit with me."

588
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,500
 And I spend most of my energies just to remind myself

589
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,500
 that He indeed is present with me.

590
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,780
 And in the last four to five months,

591
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,740
 I've actually been in the same spot with God.

592
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,340
 I've been surrendering more or less the same one thing.

593
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,180
 I've been praying the same prayers every single day.

594
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,260
 My prayer is this, "Lord, baptize me,

595
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,520
 "immerse me in your presence, in your word,

596
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,760
 "and teach me not to be upset and angry

597
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,700
 "and lash out at my children."

598
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,620
 You know, and it's painful.

599
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,940
 It's humbling when your own children

600
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,660
 teach you how to parent.

601
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,660
 But I think that's God speaking out of the wilderness to me.

602
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,040
 And I think the important thing is to remain repentant,

603
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,100
 to be open, because God is God, right?

604
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,700
 He is the Lord of all creation, all over everything.

605
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,420
 And so I don't mind spending the rest of my life

606
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,960
 just praying the same thing, learning what God has for me,

607
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,820
 if I am to grow to be more like Him.

608
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,860
 And so, church, I just wanna say,

609
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,740
 don't be discouraged in where you are,

610
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,380
 because He is with you.

611
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,940
 And we're supposed to struggle,

612
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,940
 so don't be so hard on yourself.

613
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,460
 If God can speak to me as I practice preaching,

614
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,780
 as I prepared for today,

615
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,540
 He really just spoke to me at 11.20 last night,

616
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,420
 then I'm sure He can speak to you in any situation, church.

617
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,160
 So practically, how does this look like

618
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,260
 for you and I to live out?

619
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,900
 I want to suggest three things

620
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,480
 that I've been personally adopting in my own life

621
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,080
 as a way to live out this idea and heart of baptism.

622
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:11,020
 And I just ask again, how do you and I posture ourselves

623
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,840
 to be immersed in this way of life?

624
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,500
 First, I would say the key is to be always ready

625
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,380
 to be repentant at any time.

626
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,680
 Guard your heart so that you're always ready

627
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,520
 and able to respond to God,

628
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,200
 even if it's just a very little thing

629
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,840
 that you can say or do.

630
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,760
 You know, God shows up in the most inconvenient times.

631
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,800
 He shows up in the most awkward times.

632
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,440
 He shows up in our conversations.

633
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,880
 He shows up with people we don't like,

634
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,480
 people who we don't even want to see,

635
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,160
 but yet God is there showing us in our disappointments,

636
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,920
 in our interruptions, in our pain and grief.

637
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,920
 He is there to show us Himself and to show us another way.

638
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,460
 And so that you will see, you'll be able to see

639
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,460
 if you are willing to follow Him, new perspective.

640
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,580
 And I think in this life, we will be distracted.

641
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,700
 We will be busy.

642
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,700
 We will be tempted, but no matter what,

643
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,860
 always try to get back to this place

644
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,500
 where your heart can say, "Lord, immerse me.

645
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,900
 "Lord, I know today's been really messed up,

646
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,400
 "but immerse me, that's all I need."

647
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,040
 Second suggestion is to immerse yourself in Scripture

648
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,300
 so that you can make room for the Holy Spirit in your life.

649
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,220
 Why do I say this?

650
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,700
 Because this is what Christians do.

651
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,700
 This is what, this is the only way we know.

652
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,940
 This is our way of life.

653
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,500
 Without letting Him address us with His words,

654
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,460
 we will not be able to live.

655
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,660
 You cannot discern God's voice

656
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,540
 from the deception of the enemy,

657
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,900
 from the good and well-intentioned things of this world,

658
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,740
 from God's intention.

659
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,380
 You know, and my prayer is really simple.

660
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,140
 My prayer is, "Lord, when I wake up,

661
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,820
 "I want you to be the first person that addresses me.

662
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,900
 "I want you to be the first person I talk to."

663
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,020
 And at night, I also just say,

664
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,340
 "Lord, I pray that the person going to sleep right now

665
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,660
 "is different than the person who woke up

666
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,480
 "because you encountered me, you spoke to me,

667
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,080
 "you changed my perspective, and I'm so thankful for that."

668
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,960
 Thirdly, lastly, I want to suggest

669
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,660
 to keep very short accounts in all our relationships.

670
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,500
 You know, our ultimate test, I think, of our Christianity,

671
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,740
 whether it's genuine, whether it's sincere,

672
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,220
 is simply in how we treat each other,

673
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,340
 how we treat our parents, how we treat our children,

674
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,740
 how we treat our enemies, how we treat the stranger

675
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,860
 that we bump into the street

676
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,140
 when we're in a really bad mood.

677
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,060
 What do we say to them?

678
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,840
 How do we treat them?

679
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,180
 But the good news is God is in our relationship,

680
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,880
 so whenever, in any relationship, God is there with us.

681
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,920
 And therefore, I think it's that important

682
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,720
 to prioritize managing our relationship

683
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,800
 and keeping short accounts,

684
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,840
 and that means to practice forgiveness.

685
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,360
 Because once again, I want to remind you,

686
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,380
 forgiveness removes all the barriers between us,

687
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,680
 between God and us and between you and I.

688
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,480
 And, you know, my prayer has always been that

689
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,820
 if Christians can be known for anything,

690
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,640
 it's not for mistakes, it's not for hypocrisy,

691
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,120
 or, you know, what we didn't do, didn't say,

692
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,020
 but I pray that Christians would be known

693
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,900
 for our forgiveness, that they would see Christ

694
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,840
 because in how we choose to forgive,

695
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,620
 because God has forgiven us.

696
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,300
 So, church, if I can sum up the last 25 minutes,

697
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,160
 I would say today is really about the work of God

698
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,120
 and the Holy Spirit and what he desires to do in our life.

699
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,720
 In this Advent season, and in every season of our life,

700
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,680
 this baptism of water and the Holy Spirit

701
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,220
 represents his invitation to come on a lifelong journey,

702
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,060
 a pilgrimage, a spiritual journey with the triune God

703
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,480
 who leads us to be truly free,

704
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,840
 to be truly ourselves in his presence every single day.

705
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,600
 So the simple question I ask you is, will you join him?

706
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,480
 Will you let him satisfy you?

707
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,360
 Will you let him address you and transform you?

708
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,360
 Will you allow him to immerse himself and his love upon you?

709
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,080
 Closing, in closing, church, I wanna say this.

710
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,860
 Do you remember the Great Commission?

711
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,260
 What does Jesus say there?

712
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,520
 And I wanna remind you what the Great Commission says.

713
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,380
 He says, "So you must go and make all the nations

714
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,960
 "into disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father

715
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,860
 "and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

716
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,400
 "Teach them to observe everything I've commanded you,

717
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,180
 "and look, I am with you every single day

718
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,300
 "to the very end of age."

719
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,640
 Note that Jesus calls us to baptize the nations,

720
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,040
 baptize whoever we seize in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

721
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,880
 as in we are called as Christians to immerse others

722
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,840
 in everything we know about God,

723
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,480
 everything Jesus has given us,

724
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,880
 everything that the Holy Spirit is showing us,

725
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,960
 we are called to immerse others with this,

726
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,280
 and this is a command.

727
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,580
 And so what I really wanna remind us before we go

728
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,880
 is that our faith must go beyond ourselves.

729
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,800
 We immerse ourselves, we transform, we are changed,

730
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,360
 not for our own sake, but the sake of our neighbor,

731
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,840
 for the sake of our enemy.

732
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,920
 And so having after received God's presence,

733
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,240
 we too then must go out and share the presence of God,

734
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,280
 the love of God, whatever God has given us with others,

735
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,200
 and so that others may know that there is a journey

736
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,120
 that God yearns to bring each of us on.

737
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,500
 And so this is what the Christian life is all about,

738
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,160
 and I pray that the Spirit will lead you

739
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,320
 from wherever you are today to walk with Him.

740
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,420
 Church, can we pray?

741
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:03,740
 Father, you say if we confess our sins, you are faithful,

742
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,140
 you are just, and you will forgive us and will cleanse us.

743
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,140
 You will wash us thoroughly from all that cages us

744
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,860
 and causes us to be stuck.

745
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,740
 You will free us, you will be able to make us whole again.

746
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,740
 So God, today, right now, we ask that you create in us

747
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,000
 a renewed spirit.

748
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,580
 Father, would your Spirit come and dwell in us.

749
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,980
 Immerse us, Lord God.

750
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,760
 Father, let us be with you.

751
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,980
 Wherever you are, we confess we want to follow

752
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,240
 and be with you.

753
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,240
 And Lord, as children, we ask, Lord God,

754
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,340
 that the one thing is that you would make yourself real

755
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,260
 to us today, right now.

756
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,400
 Whatever it takes, Lord God, to get our attention,

757
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,960
 Father, I pray that at the end of today, before we sleep,

758
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,600
 our hearts would say, Lord, you are the living God.

759
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,080
 You, I will follow.

760
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,320
 You, I will learn more about.

761
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,800
 And one day, I might follow you,

762
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,920
 or maybe we'll say, Lord, thank you for being with me.

763
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,260
 Thank you for immersing me.

764
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,360
 Thank you for reminding me that I'm not alone,

765
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,920
 that I don't struggle alone.

766
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,820
 I don't go through anything alone because you are with me.

767
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,260
 And so Jesus, this is our prayer.

768
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,260
 In your beautiful name, would you continue to speak to us

769
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,500
 every single moment you give to us in this precious life.

770
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,160
 And Lord, teach us to steward and treasure

771
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,680
 the greatest treasure we will ever, ever receive,

772
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,620
 and that is you.

773
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,580
 In your name we pray, amen.

774
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,160
 (gentle music)
