1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
 Good to be here.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,340
 Good to see you all.

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,280
 I know not every one of us is from Hong Kong here,

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,580
 but we stay here right now.

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,700
 If you like, if you enjoy staying in Hong Kong,

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,900
 can I ask you to put your hands together?

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,100
 Like, if you like staying in Hong Kong, that's awesome.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,600
 Like, you know, in Hong Kong we're known

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,340
 for quite a number of things,

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,020
 such as we have a super impressive skyline

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,900
 and we have this amazing view from the peak.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,020
 And if you haven't been there before, you should do it.

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,340
 Don't just watch it on the movie.

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,940
 You should go there.

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,940
 We are quite famous for our dim sum.

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,220
 True story, when I first met Rosalind,

17
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,500
 I was in Singapore and I think she asked me,

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,140
 "Have you tried Tim Ho Wan?"

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,420
 I'm like, "What's that?"

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,940
 Apparently, apparently it's a dim sum restaurant

21
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,460
 originally from Hong Kong.

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,500
 I'm like, "Okay, we're known for our dim sum."

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,060
 We, yeah, sorry about that.

24
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,380
 I tried that in Hong Kong, okay?

25
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,700
 It's really nice, go and try it.

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,220
 And we have some famous people, movie stars,

27
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,840
 like Bruce Lee, but nobody talks about Bruce Lee now.

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,280
 If you talk about a Hong Konger who's popular in Hollywood,

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,260
 you talk about this guy called Jimmy Ouyang right now.

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,280
 Okay, now I get some response, uh-huh.

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,620
 And so you know Hong Kong is just this place

32
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,820
 where East meets West.

33
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,140
 You have all sorts of culture here.

34
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,800
 We're quite proud of who we are.

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,740
 We're quite proud of all these great things

36
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,220
 that I just mentioned.

37
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,580
 But just like any other city on this planet,

38
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,460
 there are things we're known for,

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,540
 things that perhaps we're not so proud of.

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,900
 For instance, we are known for our high stress

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,340
 and our mental health crisis in our workplace and schools.

42
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,660
 So can we have the next slide?

43
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,280
 According to a global talent trend study

44
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,280
 by an HR consultant firm in 2022, just three years ago,

45
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,420
 95% of employees in Hong Kong feel at risk of burnout.

46
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,940
 Ooh, it was the highest amount Asian markets.

47
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,460
 And the reason they mentioned were the unfair treatment

48
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,380
 relative to their peers, 40% of them said that.

49
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,300
 Like, come on, like our bosses treat us differently.

50
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,420
 Or they are not being rewarded fairly for,

51
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,040
 or proportionately for the amount of work done.

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,060
 At least also 40% of them said that.

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,100
 And there's another study from AXA,

54
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,700
 the insurance company just last year,

55
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,660
 showing that 77% of workers in the city

56
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,740
 have experienced at least one mental health issue

57
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,900
 stemming from their jobs.

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,180
 Like every four people going to work here

59
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,700
 in our workforce here,

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,940
 there are three of them experiencing mental health issues.

61
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,980
 Isn't that crazy?

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,380
 Like, and okay, just don't even get me started

63
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,100
 with the students, you know, data's with the students.

64
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,660
 I'm not gonna dive in there.

65
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,380
 You know, I'll be super emotional.

66
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,000
 So I'm not going there.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,960
 But I just wanna say this, the city of Hong Kong is exhausted

68
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,380
 and this is not a figure of speech.

69
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,980
 It's not a poetic exaggeration,

70
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,700
 but it is a statistically reality,

71
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,660
 like that statistical reality that we've seen

72
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,280
 with all these statistics and research.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,060
 We just mentioned, we are so stressed to a point

74
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,900
 that we become very serious about something.

75
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,800
 In Hong Kong, we're very serious

76
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,940
 about vacations and holidays.

77
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,360
 Yeah, right?

78
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,880
 You know, we always think about when's my next vacation?

79
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,860
 Where am I going next?

80
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,860
 To a point that we came up with strategic guidelines

81
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,540
 for teaching people how to maximize their annual leave.

82
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,060
 Look at this, like if you take two annual leave

83
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,440
 and you get like, what, like nine days off

84
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,640
 with all the public holidays,

85
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,080
 we have strategic guides for that.

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,540
 Can you believe that?

87
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,440
 We're so stressed in what we do.

88
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,360
 We're so stressed in our workplace.

89
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,640
 And burnout, it's a buzzword right now.

90
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,840
 We hear about that all the time, right?

91
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,040
 It's a word that was coined, like, I guess,

92
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,620
 just in the last two or three decades.

93
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,080
 But everybody in this city knows what it means.

94
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,600
 Or maybe a lot of us, over 95% of us,

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,760
 we might have experienced some symptoms of being burned out.

96
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,080
 So let me just put some words to define what it is.

97
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,240
 Burnout basically means like,

98
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,360
 either being physically or emotionally exhausted,

99
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,680
 a cynicism and detachment or feelings of ineffectiveness

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,820
 and lack of accomplishment.

101
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,580
 Come on, we call that Tuesday, right?

102
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,640
 Or Monday, sorry.

103
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,640
 So, and a high percentage of people in our workforce

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,880
 is experiencing this right now.

105
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,720
 Maybe it's either you,

106
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,280
 or the person sitting next to you in the office,

107
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,080
 or just a guy down the row,

108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,620
 or the guy you never talk to, I don't know.

109
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,520
 But this collective fatigue, this shared ache,

110
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,880
 or this restlessness many of us would experience

111
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,400
 deep down in the spirit, it transcends industries.

112
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,640
 Basically, everybody, like, in different industries,

113
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,880
 they experience that.

114
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,440
 It transcends ethnicity.

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,320
 You don't have to be in a certain, like,

116
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,080
 people group or people type to experience that.

117
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,220
 It transcends age as well.

118
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,920
 Like, young people experience that,

119
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,960
 old people feel that as well.

120
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,640
 And in fact, it is a very modern,

121
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,400
 urban expression of a very ancient problem.

122
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,360
 So let me explain that.

123
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
 We began this sermon series we call

124
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,680
 Stewarding Our Lives last week,

125
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,720
 and we, last week, Pastor Tim talked about

126
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
 the original design of work, the goodness of work.

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,820
 God, of course, he was the first worker,

128
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,640
 and he designed labor not as a punishment,

129
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,480
 but as a dignified and essential act of cultivation,

130
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,080
 a partnership in his creative project.

131
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,420
 We, as humans, made in his image.

132
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,000
 We were supposed to be his partner,

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 doing this together, enjoying it.

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,620
 But this reality that we just mentioned last week

135
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,520
 presents a core tension that every working person,

136
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,480
 especially in our city, would feel.

137
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,040
 If work was designed for our flourishing,

138
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,380
 then why is it now so often the primary source

139
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,120
 of our anxiety, frustration, and depletion?

140
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,160
 It's also our work.

141
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,880
 Why does the place of our greatest potential contribution

142
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,840
 so frequently feel like the site of our greatest drain?

143
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,600
 So many of us have been around long enough.

144
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,700
 We talk about all these different problems in life.

145
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,540
 You know, we talk about our problematic relationships.

146
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,720
 We talk about, like, you know, a broken self-image.

147
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,560
 We talk about these damaged relationships

148
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
 or destructive behavior.

149
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,400
 We talk about all these,

150
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,800
 and almost every single time when we talk about this,

151
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,320
 on stage, I'll bring you back to one particular page

152
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,560
 on the Bible.

153
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,000
 You know, in fact, I uploaded all my sermons to AI,

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,280
 like all my sermons preaching in this church to AI,

155
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,720
 and I asked AI, "Hey, AI, how many times have I preached

156
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,960
 "on Genesis 3 in the Vineyard Long?"

157
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,000
 And it says seven times.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,840
 So I guess this is the eighth time I'm gonna talk

159
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,340
 about Genesis 3 with all of us.

160
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,960
 But before we dive in to Genesis 3,

161
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,720
 I just wanna give us, before we look into it,

162
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,480
 I know we talked about this passage

163
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,280
 in all different locations.

164
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,940
 We talk about all different sorts of problems

165
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,560
 we have in life, but I do wanna highlight something

166
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,480
 before we jump in, that yes,

167
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,720
 Genesis 3 is about the fall, is about sin,

168
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,720
 but sin, it's never just about a personal or a private life.

169
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,240
 It also affects our public life, our social life,

170
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,640
 and it surely affects our work.

171
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,280
 So this is where we're coming from today.

172
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,800
 This is how we're going to look at this passage today.

173
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,760
 Let's look at Genesis 3, verses 16 to 19.

174
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,440
 So to the woman, which is God,

175
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,920
 to the woman God said, oh, these words are so small now.

176
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,280
 Okay.

177
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,840
 It's just the glasses, just the glasses.

178
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,560
 To the woman he said, "I will make your pains

179
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,600
 "in childbearing very severe.

180
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,400
 "With painful labor, you will give birth to children.

181
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,240
 "Your desire will be for your husband,

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,520
 "and he will rule over you."

183
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,440
 To Adam, God said, "Because you listened to your wife

184
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,360
 "and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you,

185
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,400
 "you must not eat from it.

186
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,140
 "Cursed is the ground because of you.

187
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,640
 "Through painful toil, you will eat food from it

188
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,040
 "all the days of your life.

189
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,360
 "It will produce thorns and thistles for you,

190
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
 "and you will eat the plants of the field.

191
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,460
 "By the sweat of your brow, you will eat your food

192
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,780
 "until you return to ground,

193
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,060
 "since from it you were taken.

194
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,060
 "From dust you are, and to dust you will return."

195
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,900
 Let me say this up front.

196
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,780
 This passage, although it talks about all these fruits

197
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,460
 or the ground and planting and trees and all that,

198
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,080
 this passage, it's not a simple story

199
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,380
 about ancient agriculture,

200
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,060
 but it's a foundational paradigm

201
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,160
 for all human labor in the fallen world.

202
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,100
 It has something to do with every single one of us here.

203
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,740
 The thorns and thistles that God speaks of,

204
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,940
 they are not just merely some troublesome plants.

205
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,340
 They are actually representing, it's a profound metaphor,

206
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,140
 representing the very frustrations,

207
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,060
 the fatalities, the pains culminating

208
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,340
 in the modern experience of burnout

209
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,780
 in perhaps your life or my life

210
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,460
 that it's basically in our everyday work nowadays.

211
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,020
 To understand this ancient curse

212
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,300
 is to take the first critical step

213
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,260
 toward finding the gospel cure of it.

214
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,780
 So in order to understand this, oh, sorry,

215
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,700
 that passage we just read, we are going to,

216
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,260
 I'm gonna put another passage side by side on the screen,

217
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,420
 which is Genesis 1:28, which says this.

218
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,280
 "God blessed them, Adam and Eve,

219
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,560
 "and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number.

220
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,460
 "'Fill the earth and subdue it.

221
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,600
 "'Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky

222
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,940
 "'and over every living creature that moves on the ground.'

223
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,060
 "In God's original blessing and command to human,

224
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,160
 "there are at least two parts.

225
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,160
 "First, be fruitful, multiply, to reproduce, if you will,

226
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,580
 "which means this is something we have to achieve

227
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,040
 "through natural birth,

228
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,560
 "bringing forth new lives in families."

229
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,680
 Of course, I'm a father myself,

230
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,820
 and I know that in this whole process

231
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,460
 of increasing in number of reproduction,

232
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,760
 Mommy is a real hero in this picture, okay?

233
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,020
 And Mommy's in the service now, okay?

234
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,240
 In Chinese service, she wasn't.

235
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,000
 So Mommy is a real hero here.

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,540
 She does basically all the heavy lifting

237
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,240
 from the baby being just a seat like that in the womb

238
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,620
 all the way, after 10 months,

239
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,540
 became a full-on baby, three pound,

240
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,260
 and then you have to give birth to a baby.

241
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,580
 That whole process, Mommy has a lot of work to do,

242
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,700
 and God has given mothers this beautiful,

243
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,340
 life-giving capacity to nurture a new life

244
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,820
 in the womb for 10 long months.

245
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,460
 Round of applause for all the mothers, yay!

246
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,500
 [audience applauding]

247
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,380
 Okay, just because my wife is here, that's why I do that.

248
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,020
 Anyway, the ability is not just,

249
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,820
 this ability to bring forth new life,

250
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,680
 it's not just for the continuation of our species,

251
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,140
 but it's for the fulfillment

252
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,160
 of the original command and blessing, just right there.

253
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,660
 But now the labor to bring forth new life,

254
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,700
 like all other aspects of human life,

255
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,980
 it's under the curse of sin.

256
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,140
 That's why on this side, you see that.

257
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,340
 You see that now, when women give birth,

258
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,460
 they will go through a lot of pain.

259
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,880
 Trust me, I witnessed that two times.

260
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,940
 I know it's really like a lot of pain.

261
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,340
 Even being squeezed on the other side,

262
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,920
 I could feel a little bit of that pain.

263
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,740
 I know the real pain is so much more severe.

264
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,820
 So yeah, wow, right?

265
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,300
 Yeah, yeah, I feel a little bit as well.

266
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,660
 So the original Hebrew word for pain here

267
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,100
 is this word called isabon.

268
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,640
 It's often translated as pain,

269
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,560
 but as well as toil or painful labor

270
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,640
 or hardship or even sorrow.

271
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,580
 The funny thing is that it occurred another time

272
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,180
 just in the next verse.

273
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,860
 Sorry, could I have the last slide back again?

274
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,800
 Thank you.

275
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,160
 This word appear again in verse 17,

276
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,780
 when God says, "Cursed is the ground because of you

277
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,240
 "through painful toil, through this isabon,

278
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,460
 "you will eat food from it all the days of your life."

279
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,980
 So we see that both men and women, when they sin,

280
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,860
 they both were under this curse.

281
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,340
 They both went through some sort of pain in different ways.

282
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,460
 The biblical author deliberately used this parallel

283
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,200
 to establish a profound connection between the two,

284
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,840
 that the pain now infects most

285
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,400
 of our intimate, relational, and creative life

286
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,960
 that is in childbearing,

287
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,080
 and the pain that infects our vocational life,

288
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,600
 working on the ground,

289
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,560
 they all spring from the same cursed source.

290
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,760
 And not just that,

291
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,720
 both are actually a distortion of a pre-fall good.

292
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,200
 You see that originally God commanded and blessed humans

293
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,380
 to bring forth new life, to reproduce,

294
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,800
 and God asked human to rule over, to subdue the earth.

295
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,920
 And now these are the exact areas where Adam and Eve,

296
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,560
 they were under curse right now in childbearing

297
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,200
 and in their vocation, in their working on the ground.

298
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,760
 But the curse didn't just stop at bearing,

299
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,800
 painful childbirth, it goes actually deeper,

300
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,240
 especially that relational curse or brokenness,

301
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,640
 it goes way deeper.

302
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,140
 It goes into our most intimate relationships.

303
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,920
 God said to the woman, He said,

304
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,180
 your desire will be for your husband

305
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,120
 and he will rule over you.

306
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
 Now, if we wanna understand

307
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,600
 what this word desire really means,

308
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,480
 the Bible actually gives us a massive clue

309
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,280
 in the next chapter.

310
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,280
 In chapter four, we know that Adam and Eve,

311
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,880
 they brought forth two children, Cain and Abel.

312
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,520
 And you know, the two of them were trying

313
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,640
 to bring offering to God and God loves Abel's offering,

314
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,140
 but not so, so with Cain's offering

315
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,340
 and Cain was really angry.

316
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,700
 He was really pissed off.

317
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,700
 And God says this to him in Genesis chapter four.

318
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,020
 Oh, my tiny Bible with small words.

319
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,140
 Here we go.

320
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,940
 I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm still young.

321
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,780
 Then the Lord said to Cain, why are you angry?

322
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,900
 Why is your face downcast?

323
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,560
 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted?

324
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,020
 But if you do not do what is right,

325
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,660
 sin, it's crouching at your door,

326
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,660
 it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.

327
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,360
 Sin desires you, you must rule over it.

328
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,400
 God said to the woman, you will desire for your husband,

329
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,680
 but he will rule over you.

330
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,040
 So if you wanna understand the real meaning

331
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,000
 of what desire here is,

332
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,640
 we put these verses side by side together

333
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,840
 and you have a conclusion that this word desire

334
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,360
 probably doesn't mean intimacy,

335
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,720
 doesn't mean, oh, I want his love.

336
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,760
 It's not like that.

337
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,280
 It means a desire to consume, to control, to dominate.

338
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,280
 So what God is describing here is a tragic breakdown

339
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,980
 of the original partnership between men and women,

340
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,960
 between Adam and Eve.

341
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,260
 What was created to be beautiful, a harmonious relationship

342
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,660
 is now twisted into a power struggle.

343
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,960
 It becomes a cycle of one person sinfully

344
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,280
 desiring to control over the other.

345
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,520
 And then the other responded,

346
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,640
 responding with a distorted sinful rule.

347
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,420
 And that's how relationships start to break down.

348
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,520
 And right here, the very fabric of a human relationship,

349
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,520
 the foundation of community and family is torn apart

350
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,380
 by our turn to self-centeredness.

351
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,120
 When we're under the curse of sin,

352
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,420
 it's not just the pain that ladies,

353
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,160
 like they experience in their childbirth.

354
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,600
 It's this curse, this pain, this distorted relationship

355
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,200
 that we experience in every level of our social life,

356
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,360
 of our intimate relationships.

357
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,560
 And this brokenness doesn't just stay in our homes.

358
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,080
 It spills right into our world of work, our workplaces.

359
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,540
 So in the next verse, the curse isn't on Adam himself,

360
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,200
 but on the ground.

361
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,240
 The very domain of his work.

362
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,580
 God says, "Cursed is the ground because of you."

363
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,320
 Remember, this man, Adam, he was formed from the ground

364
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,920
 and the ground in Hebrew is adamah.

365
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,960
 So man is adam, adam and adamah.

366
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,920
 Originally, man, Adam, was taken out of adamah,

367
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,400
 was taken out of the ground.

368
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,900
 It meant that they used to have this beautiful partnership

369
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,520
 in the beautiful project of creation.

370
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,040
 Man and the ground, they used to be partners.

371
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,380
 When men work on the ground together,

372
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,360
 they bring forth the beauty,

373
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,920
 the glory of God in his whole creation.

374
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,000
 But now the relationship is fundamentally broken.

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,680
 The ground, which was supposed to be Adam's partner,

376
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,460
 now becomes his adversary.

377
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,040
 Work is no longer just a joyful process of cultivation,

378
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,800
 like Pastor Tim talked about last week.

379
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,800
 It now becomes a struggle against a resistant world.

380
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,840
 Isn't that what we feel at work sometimes?

381
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
 Like I'm trying to work hard,

382
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,600
 but it feels like something is working against me.

383
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,880
 It could be someone, it could be some people,

384
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,700
 it could be the system, it could be all sorts of things

385
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,680
 trying to work against me.

386
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,300
 Every morning when I send my girls to school,

387
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,600
 I feel even the traffic lights are working against me.

388
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,260
 Like, come on, come on, come on.

389
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,240
 And God gives this powerful picture for this reality.

390
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,920
 It says in verse 18,

391
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,320
 it will produce thorns and thistles for you.

392
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,840
 And let's be honest,

393
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,480
 God is not talking about weeds in the garden.

394
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
 Thorns and thistles are the unforeseen complications

395
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,620
 that wreck our best laid plans.

396
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,600
 It could be team conflicts that drain our energy.

397
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,200
 It could be the broken system we have to fight against.

398
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,280
 It could be the market that will suddenly crash.

399
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,000
 It could be the computer that dies right before the deadline.

400
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,680
 Anything that is hindering you from doing your work,

401
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,680
 from being productive, from being fruitful in your work,

402
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,360
 those are the thorns and thistles.

403
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,880
 And we have all these,

404
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,800
 we have thorns and thistles in every single part of our work

405
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,000
 or even in our lives.

406
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,840
 When we try to bring forth something good,

407
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,740
 we always feel or face opposition.

408
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,800
 We always face the obstacles.

409
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,320
 There are things that are trying to stop us

410
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,200
 to do what is good,

411
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,040
 to do what we're supposed to do, or just simply,

412
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,360
 and I'm just trying to do my job.

413
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,320
 Can life be a little bit more easier?

414
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,040
 You know, this is so difficult for us sometimes.

415
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,080
 Thorns and, okay, bless you.

416
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,000
 (congregation laughing)

417
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
 Thorns and thistles are everywhere

418
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,120
 in every part of our life, especially in our work.

419
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,000
 They are there.

420
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,200
 And finally, in verse 19, we see this.

421
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,760
 God says, "By the sweat of your brow,

422
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,480
 "you will eat your food."

423
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,980
 This tells us that our labor,

424
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,240
 it's now this exhausting struggle,

425
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,120
 often just for survival.

426
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:04,080
 In Cantonese, we say, (speaking in foreign language)

427
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,160
 We're just trying to earn our bread from hand to mouth.

428
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,280
 We're just trying to survive,

429
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,280
 not even trying to think, dream big,

430
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,320
 or think about more amazing things and all that.

431
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,880
 And I know we have an executive coach here

432
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,680
 and he does all this stuff, like talking about,

433
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,460
 "So what's your plan, what do you wanna achieve?"

434
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,760
 We're not even talking about that,

435
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,900
 I'm just talking about surviving here.

436
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,840
 And that's what's happened.

437
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,300
 That's a constant struggle, being humans,

438
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,360
 after the fall in this fallen world.

439
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,220
 And it all culminates to this final heartbreaking reality.

440
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,960
 God says, "For thus you are, and to thus you will return."

441
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,600
 We're not just talking about fruitlessness in our work.

442
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,460
 We're not just talking about all the obstacles.

443
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,860
 We're talking about after everything you've done,

444
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,700
 every effort you've paid in your work,

445
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,320
 ultimately, under the sun, they're pointless.

446
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,980
 Like you've done so much to build something,

447
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,720
 when you're gone, the next person pick it up

448
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,940
 and they just wipe everything out.

449
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,620
 It's as though you've done nothing

450
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,420
 to build anything in the past

451
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,760
 and all your effort was just pointless.

452
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,300
 And this is where, in the Bible,

453
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,220
 there's a book called Ecclesiastes.

454
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,700
 It says this, it says like,

455
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,860
 it's like chasing the wind,

456
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,780
 when all the greatest success

457
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,820
 that you're so proud of in your life,

458
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,540
 they're swallowed by death in the end.

459
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,140
 Like making all your hard work really, really empty.

460
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,360
 It's nothing.

461
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,100
 You thought you did something great.

462
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,900
 Sorry, when you die, it's nothing.

463
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,780
 Nobody will remember it.

464
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,060
 Nobody will remember you.

465
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,380
 It's nothing, it's chasing the wind.

466
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,380
 So in simple terms, the curses in Genesis 3, 16 to 19,

467
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,100
 it's indeed a tragic reversal

468
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,100
 of God's original blessings from Genesis 1, 28.

469
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
 God's initial design was for humans

470
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,700
 to experience joyful, fruitful experience

471
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
 in building families and society,

472
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,140
 to find dignity in caring for creation through work.

473
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,900
 And however, after humanity's rebellion,

474
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,060
 these blessings were corrupted.

475
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,220
 And the joy of childbearing now turned into pain.

476
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,980
 And marital harmony was replaced by power struggle.

477
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,500
 Meaningful work becomes lifelong painful toil

478
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,660
 against a cursed ground,

479
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,200
 a struggle which would ultimately end in death,

480
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,060
 in meaningless death.

481
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,260
 That's where all this pressure comes from, right?

482
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,540
 You know, right now in our society or in this generation,

483
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,740
 we talk about burnout so much

484
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,740
 that at least in this part of the world,

485
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,460
 we have the next generation, they have a countermeasure.

486
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,740
 They call that like lying flat and not doing anything.

487
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,740
 They just lie flat on the ground.

488
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:03,100
 Actually, there is this philosophy called existentialism,

489
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,800
 telling people that there is actually no meaning in life,

490
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,460
 despite all you do, despite all that you try to build,

491
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,980
 all that you plant, there's no meaning in life.

492
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,380
 So why don't you just chill?

493
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,220
 And we see that right now because of all the burnout,

494
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,500
 because of this ancient problem we're facing,

495
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,260
 that leads to the burnout we're feeling.

496
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,420
 This generation is saying, I don't see any meaning in life.

497
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,720
 I see life work is meaningless.

498
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,420
 Why don't we just chill?

499
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,940
 Why don't we do nothing and just, I don't know, just be?

500
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,960
 And just, I don't know, just try to enjoy life.

501
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,580
 It's meaningless anyway.

502
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,020
 If we continue to live under this curse,

503
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,880
 it could look a little bit like that,

504
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,900
 look quite meaningless.

505
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,820
 But now after hearing all this,

506
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,200
 it's very important for me to say what I'm gonna say next.

507
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,640
 It will be easy to think that work itself, it's a curse,

508
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,960
 but that's totally not what the Bible

509
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,320
 is trying to teach us.

510
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,840
 We have to be super clear.

511
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,320
 I don't want you to go out from church today

512
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,700
 and thinking, oh yeah, my work is cursed.

513
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,480
 Pastor Chapman says so.

514
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,120
 Maybe I should just retire or quit my job,

515
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,340
 take all my saving and travel around.

516
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,400
 No, I'm not saying that.

517
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,360
 I'm not saying work is evil.

518
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,020
 I'm not saying work is a curse.

519
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,040
 Work is still a good thing.

520
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,440
 Work was there in the beginning, in the garden,

521
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,280
 before sin ever entered the picture, work was there.

522
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,320
 Work is good.

523
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,340
 It's part of God's original design for us.

524
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,160
 God himself worked to create this world

525
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,720
 and he made us in his image to be his partners,

526
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,800
 co-workers, so that to joyfully bring forth

527
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,440
 potential in his creation.

528
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,560
 I know we preached that last week,

529
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,520
 but I just feel I need to preach a disclaimer.

530
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,720
 I'm not saying, after everything I talked about,

531
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,800
 I'm not saying work is a curse,

532
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,000
 but work itself is not a curse.

533
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,940
 The curse is the frustration of work.

534
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,940
 Let me say this again.

535
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,060
 The curse isn't work itself,

536
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,120
 though you experience a lot of hardship in work,

537
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,980
 but the curse itself is not work.

538
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,780
 The curse is the frustration of work.

539
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,740
 There's a pastor who passed away recently.

540
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,700
 His name is Tim Keller.

541
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,140
 He said this, "Work is not itself a curse,

542
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,500
 "but it now lies with all other aspects of human life

543
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,960
 "under the curse of sin."

544
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,180
 There's another author, John Mark Comer.

545
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,820
 He says this, "Our work in this broken world,

546
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,280
 "it's now marked by thorns and thistles

547
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,440
 "and a nagging sense of dissatisfaction."

548
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,680
 No matter how hard you try,

549
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,700
 no matter how many jobs you change,

550
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,700
 no matter how much you fantasize,

551
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,180
 you try to be nice to everyone at work,

552
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,940
 there's still this dissatisfaction inside of us,

553
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,380
 inside of our hearts.

554
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,460
 And this is that exactly what we feel

555
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,860
 like when we work, when we go, you know, Monday morning,

556
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,540
 maybe that's exactly how you feel.

557
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,360
 Our work, although this could look like that picture,

558
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,700
 although there is a frustration of work,

559
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,660
 but we know that our work can still be fruitful.

560
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,240
 Well, God says, at least God says you can eat

561
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,100
 from the plants of the field.

562
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
 Well, at least you will still create something.

563
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,500
 At least you can feed yourself.

564
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,800
 And we can still find moments of purpose if we try to.

565
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,780
 But now, this purpose, this moment, this productivity

566
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,140
 is always mixed with struggles, with pain,

567
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,720
 and we're never fully satisfied in our hearts

568
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,900
 the way God originally intended us to.

569
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,840
 So why do we still go to work?

570
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,140
 There was this video in Hong Kong circulating

571
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,860
 like a couple of years ago.

572
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,240
 It was a blue collar construction worker.

573
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,380
 So people, his friends just filmed and asked him,

574
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,300
 hey, why do you work?

575
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,380
 Is it because of love?

576
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,060
 Is it because of responsibility?

577
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,380
 Because I'm poor!

578
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,500
 (audience laughing)

579
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,820
 Yeah.

580
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,660
 Isn't it fascinating that,

581
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,700
 yeah, you know I screen out a lot of words, right?

582
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,300
 If you watch the original thing.

583
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,900
 Isn't it fascinating that what the Bible described

584
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,220
 thousands of years ago,

585
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,400
 it's what our social scientists are discovering today

586
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,500
 when they study burnout.

587
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,900
 Like, you know, in fact, studies done right here in Hong Kong

588
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,420
 have found in all these bigger courses of burnout

589
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,300
 are things like interpersonal conflict,

590
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,020
 relationships with colleagues and managers,

591
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,260
 or lack of support at work.

592
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,300
 Like, come on, Adam and Eve, they experienced that.

593
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,180
 They experienced that firsthand.

594
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,940
 We're just continuing that life in the curse.

595
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,420
 This show us something very important here.

596
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,820
 A huge part of our stress at work,

597
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,020
 it doesn't just come from work itself.

598
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,260
 I mean the thorns and thistles from the ground.

599
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,060
 It comes from the broken relationships we have to navigate.

600
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,660
 The thorns and thistles that grow between people.

601
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,780
 There are thorns and thistles between people

602
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,860
 sometimes as well.

603
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,020
 You see the curse on our relationship

604
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,100
 and the curse on our work,

605
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,340
 they're not two separate problems.

606
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,140
 In fact, they are one single,

607
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,740
 they're from one single tangled root system,

608
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,980
 feeding each other and creating this deep

609
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,620
 and overwhelming frustrations in our lives.

610
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,940
 It's one problem.

611
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,460
 It's in the work, it's in a relationship,

612
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,940
 but they're tangled together.

613
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,620
 So all the burnout, all the stress that we're experiencing,

614
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,900
 it's not just from the work.

615
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,220
 It's from all these broken relationships as well.

616
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,420
 But beneath all these external pressures,

617
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,620
 there's a deep spiritual reason for your burnout.

618
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,540
 And the Bible calls that idolatry.

619
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,820
 Idolatry means when we look to our work

620
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,860
 to give what only God is meant to give.

621
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,020
 That is our identity, our meaning, our security.

622
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,740
 Well, there's an example in the Bible,

623
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,300
 the ancient like a tower of Babel,

624
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,260
 when men built that, they would say,

625
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,020
 "We're gonna make a name for ourselves."

626
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,900
 How many of us we go to work nowadays

627
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,740
 just wanna make a name for ourselves?

628
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,860
 I just wanna be seen.

629
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,540
 I just wanna be heard.

630
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,420
 I just wanna be known.

631
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,460
 I just want people recognize my effort.

632
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,860
 I just want, you know, or maybe in some industries,

633
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
 they have annual awards.

634
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,500
 I just wanna stand on that stage, receive that award

635
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,540
 to show people that I'm capable,

636
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,540
 to show people that I'm qualified,

637
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,580
 to show people that I have what it takes.

638
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,700
 We always try to work to prove something.

639
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,540
 We always try to work to make a name for ourselves,

640
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,940
 to prove our identity, to prove our values.

641
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,020
 We'll talk about idolatry in the next couple of weeks,

642
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,900
 so I'm not gonna dive deep here,

643
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,580
 but I just wanna say that

644
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,380
 that's part of the cause of our burnout.

645
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,740
 That's a very deep spiritual root in our burnout.

646
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,940
 Burnout is the inevitable collapse

647
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,540
 that happens when we place an infinite weight,

648
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,060
 which is a need for salvation and purpose and security

649
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,060
 on something finite, like a job.

650
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,020
 It was never designed to carry that weight

651
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,860
 and it's destined to crush us.

652
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,540
 If you wanna prove who you are,

653
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,380
 if you wanna find your identity, find your worth,

654
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,220
 find your value and all those things,

655
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,500
 you are doomed to be crushed in your life.

656
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,100
 This is especially true here in Hong Kong,

657
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,820
 where the intensely competitive culture

658
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,980
 demands relentless performance.

659
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,340
 This external pressure finds a willing partner

660
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,100
 in our own hearts, which are already desperate

661
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,620
 to find self-worth through achievements.

662
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,580
 There's a destructive cycle here.

663
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,620
 Burnout here, it's more than just a stress problem.

664
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,220
 Church, this is a spiritual crisis.

665
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,460
 It's the unspoken religion of our city here

666
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,900
 that the false gospel is saying,

667
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,420
 save yourself, make a name for yourself

668
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,660
 through your success, through your achievement.

669
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,420
 If you could do better, you can save yourself.

670
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,660
 If you could work harder and achieve more,

671
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,420
 then you will be recognized and you can save yourself.

672
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,420
 And the true remedy must go deeper

673
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,740
 than just practical tips.

674
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,380
 Hey, five practical tips to prevent burnout.

675
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,740
 We need something deeper.

676
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,100
 We need to address the lie that is in the roots.

677
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:33,020
 I know a lot of you have been with us for a while

678
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,940
 and you've heard I share a lot of stories about myself.

679
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,300
 One of that happened when I was young.

680
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,580
 I was living with just my dad back then,

681
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,580
 just the two of us, and there was one day

682
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,740
 I stole money from my dad.

683
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,060
 Well, anyway, teacher found out, my dad found out,

684
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,460
 he was furious, and I was lectured.

685
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,620
 And from that day on, I carry a broken heart inside of me.

686
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,860
 When I was a kid, every single day

687
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,860
 when I look into a mirror, I see a bad person in the mirror.

688
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,660
 I'm so ashamed of myself,

689
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,500
 but I desperately need somebody to love me, to recognize me.

690
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,380
 And I realized when I was young,

691
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,900
 when I was about five or six,

692
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,660
 if I could perform, if I could be smart,

693
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,380
 if I could be outstanding in some areas,

694
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,540
 then I would gain people's love.

695
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,380
 I could win their love back.

696
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,340
 I could win their attention.

697
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,060
 And so I tried to perform and perform and perform.

698
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,020
 I did at school, I joined drama, music,

699
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,460
 and all these things, just stand on the stage

700
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,420
 just to do this, and so people would love me more.

701
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,020
 And I've been doing that.

702
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,060
 And I've been trying so hard just to earn some love

703
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,260
 through my performance.

704
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,780
 And then at the same time, some of you knew that as well,

705
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,860
 I carry my own thorns and thistles in my life.

706
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:57,820
 That is my ADHD, or more precisely, my undiagnosed ADHD.

707
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,260
 I went through so much hardship, so much toil,

708
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,180
 so much failure, I cried so many times

709
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,420
 because I tried to do something,

710
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,460
 but I failed again and again and again and again and again.

711
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,460
 I struggle, I wrestle with my own thorns

712
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,900
 and thistles in my life.

713
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,380
 And when these two combine together, it doesn't help.

714
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,820
 It just makes my life even more miserable.

715
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,700
 But at the age of 30, for the first time in my life,

716
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,940
 I walked through the doors of a psychiatric clinic.

717
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,980
 Went to see a psychiatrist, and he told me these words.

718
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,260
 He said, "Hey, Mr. Fu, yes, you can confirm

719
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,940
 "that you have ADHD."

720
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,940
 I remember when I walked out of that clinic that day,

721
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,100
 I asked God a question.

722
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,740
 I asked God, "Why now?"

723
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,660
 Oh, but let me tell you a little bit about the backstory.

724
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,500
 Perhaps I didn't tell you, when I was in uni,

725
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,940
 which I didn't complete, I was majoring in social work,

726
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,060
 which means all my teachers, all my lecturers, professors,

727
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,260
 they're either professional psychologists

728
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,860
 or they are registered social workers.

729
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,820
 And when I was at the age of 20,

730
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,580
 I, well, studied a little bit of social work,

731
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,020
 mental health stuff, and then I went to class

732
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,340
 and asked my teacher.

733
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,740
 I said, "Professor, do you think I have ADHD?"

734
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,980
 She said, "Nah, if you have ADHD, you wouldn't be here."

735
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,020
 Nah, so I brushed that idea off.

736
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,300
 And I had 10 miserable years after that.

737
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:31,620
 When I walked out of that clinic, I asked God, "Why now?"

738
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,420
 You could have made my teacher said yes 10 years ago.

739
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,980
 You know that, right, God?

740
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,700
 You know that you could, right?

741
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,220
 Do I have to remind you?

742
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:45,020
 And I just saw God gently come and ask me this question.

743
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,980
 If I let you choose all over again, how would you choose?

744
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:55,700
 Then I realized two things on that day.

745
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:02,260
 Number one, yes, I do struggle with my thorns and thistles

746
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,980
 in my life, in my formative years.

747
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,580
 I had some really, really low moments,

748
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,420
 really, really bad days.

749
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,620
 I even went through some sort of depression.

750
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,940
 But my thorns and thistles also led me to a place

751
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,100
 where I experienced the unconditional love of God

752
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,780
 like nowhere else.

753
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,780
 My thorns and thistles brought me to a place

754
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,940
 where I experienced his love for me,

755
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,300
 that he calls me his son.

756
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,780
 He loves me no matter what,

757
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,660
 that he's not counting on my mistakes

758
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
 or counting my mistakes.

759
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,860
 He's not trying to ask me to prove myself to him.

760
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,540
 He just loves me as I am.

761
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,580
 I got to experience that, not in my achievements,

762
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,740
 not in my success.

763
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,740
 I got to experience that in the lowest place in my life

764
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,340
 where my thorns and thistles pushed me into that place.

765
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,840
 (congregation applauding)

766
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,020
 And so perhaps, yeah, thorns and thistles,

767
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,940
 they're not pretty desirable,

768
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:13,340
 but maybe it's a way for us to find a connection with God

769
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,060
 that we could never find elsewhere.

770
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,620
 I remember walking out of the clinic that day.

771
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,340
 I realized something.

772
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,980
 I realized how much God's love has changed me

773
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,020
 in the last 10 years,

774
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,380
 how I realize who I am in him.

775
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,220
 I'm his son.

776
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,940
 I have security like I never had before.

777
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,260
 I'm not trying to count on my performance.

778
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,460
 I'm not trying to win anyone's approval or love anymore.

779
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,460
 I'm just starting to feel secure in being the child of God.

780
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,820
 And God says this.

781
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,180
 Says, yeah, you know, Chapman, in the past,

782
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,620
 you work for your identity.

783
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,860
 I guess many of us do that as well.

784
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,700
 We work for our identity.

785
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,900
 If we have better results,

786
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,500
 if we get better grades at school,

787
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,700
 if we have a better portfolio at work,

788
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,660
 maybe you earn more money or you get certain awards

789
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,540
 or whatever way of KPI,

790
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,060
 and you are a person that is more worthy.

791
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,420
 That's how we see ourselves.

792
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,660
 We always, in this culture,

793
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,260
 this performance-driven culture,

794
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,300
 we always work for our identity.

795
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,540
 But God says, have you noticed

796
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,740
 now you're working from your identity

797
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,460
 when you know you're my son?

798
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,980
 I share with some of you,

799
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,020
 there's one time I was asked to translate at an event.

800
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,460
 I've never done Mandarin Cantonese before.

801
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,500
 I was super nervous.

802
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,940
 I was so nervous that if I,

803
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,860
 what if I got on stage,

804
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,580
 my mind just went blank and what would happen?

805
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
 Like I'll be (speaks in foreign language)

806
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,420
 I'll be (groans)

807
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,660
 Like people just look at me and they will laugh at me.

808
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,780
 And then God just,

809
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,340
 Holy Spirit just taught me to pray this.

810
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,900
 Chapman just declared that when you walk on that stage,

811
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:04,220
 I'm the son of God, no more, no less.

812
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,620
 And that security,

813
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,780
 the sense of security just start to fill me

814
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,180
 from head to toe.

815
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,740
 And God says, do you notice right now

816
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,260
 the journey I've brought you through

817
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,980
 because of your thorns and thistles

818
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,580
 is a journey from you working for your identity

819
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:22,060
 to now you're working from your identity, son.

820
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,620
 Did you even notice that?

821
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,660
 So if I let you choose again,

822
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,980
 what would you choose?

823
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,500
 Do you wanna avoid these thorns and thistles?

824
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,020
 Do you just want a quick fix?

825
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,820
 God says in your 20s,

826
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,020
 if I give you a quick fix in your 20s,

827
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,100
 if the teacher said yes to you,

828
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,260
 if you go and see a psychiatrist then

829
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,340
 and all you could be fixed is your performance.

830
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:51,340
 I only ask God to fix my performance

831
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,300
 so that I could perform

832
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,100
 and I could continue to win favor in my life.

833
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,220
 But God says, I want it to fix,

834
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,020
 I want it to heal your identity.

835
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,860
 We ask God to fix our performances,

836
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,940
 God wants to heal our identities, church.

837
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,220
 So if thorns and thistles are the way,

838
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,300
 I don't like it.

839
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,900
 I still, if I look back,

840
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,580
 I could still cry right now.

841
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,060
 I still feel the pain that it's so born.

842
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,900
 But if you let me choose that again,

843
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,660
 I don't think that is too scary.

844
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:31,660
 If you could feel the presence,

845
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,460
 the love of your creator,

846
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,980
 loving you for just who you are,

847
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,940
 I'm telling you, that kind of encounter,

848
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,740
 that kind of experience,

849
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,620
 there's nothing else on earth.

850
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,940
 There's no other places in life

851
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,100
 that could compare to that.

852
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,420
 And so I'm gonna finish with this quote

853
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,340
 from John Mark Coma.

854
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,540
 He said, "The curse is perhaps a blessing

855
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,020
 "and a camouflage in disguise.

856
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,820
 "It's God's love in disguise,

857
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,620
 "His mercy incognito."

858
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,100
 We talk a lot about this curse today,

859
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,580
 how undesirable it is,

860
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,100
 how bad it is,

861
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,380
 how much pain it brings us.

862
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,500
 We first know that because of Jesus,

863
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,060
 one day we will be free,

864
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,220
 completely free from this pain.

865
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,460
 But at the same time,

866
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,700
 when we are in that already,

867
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,540
 but not yet,

868
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,180
 when we're still here right now

869
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,980
 on this side of eternity,

870
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
 when we're still experiencing that pain

871
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,580
 that was caused by that curse,

872
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,300
 we don't have to be afraid.

873
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,260
 Because we have God,

874
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,700
 even when we are in exile,

875
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,660
 living under this curse,

876
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,940
 He never stopped loving us.

877
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,740
 He never stopped blessing us.

878
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,420
 He never stopped calling us His children,

879
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,580
 His sons, His daughters.

880
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:57,540
 It is this God we come back to

881
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,660
 through Jesus Christ.

882
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,060
 And it's this God whom we call Father,

883
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,500
 that we're His sons and daughters,

884
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,460
 that we could work from this identity

885
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,780
 as God's sons and daughters

886
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,500
 to bring forth change in this world.

887
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,180
 Therefore, your work today is meaningful.

888
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,980
 It contributes to the ultimate reality

889
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,700
 when Jesus comes back.

890
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,420
 We are building something

891
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,180
 towards the eternal kingdom.

892
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,780
 What we're doing right now,

893
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,780
 it matters if we're not working for our identity,

894
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,860
 if we're working from our identity.

895
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,500
 How about we pray together?

896
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,340
 Let's pray.

897
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,580
 (laughing)

898
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:54,980
 I first wanna pray for people

899
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,420
 who are struggling with your own thorns and thistles in life,

900
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,340
 in work, in relationships.

901
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:08,900
 I know it's scary, I know it's painful.

902
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,580
 If that's you, you know that's you,

903
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,420
 you're struggling with this like thorns and thistles,

904
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,580
 struggles and hardship and pain

905
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,380
 and all that in your life right now.

906
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:24,660
 I just invite you, simply invite you to open your hands

907
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,100
 and allow the Holy Spirit to come

908
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,060
 and pour out His love on you.

909
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:34,620
 I know for some people, He may take away those struggles,

910
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,580
 but for others, He simply be there with you.

911
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,380
 He simply fill you up with His Holy Spirit,

912
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,220
 fill you up with His love

913
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,340
 and tell you that He will never leave you,

914
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,020
 not ever forsake you.

915
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,180
 He will be there.

916
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,140
 Receive the Holy Spirit.

917
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:58,380
 Know that God is a God

918
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,900
 who can turn even a curse into a blessing.

919
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,780
 Knowing that despite this curse,

920
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,180
 despite the thorns and thistles in your life right now,

921
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,180
 His love for you will never change.

922
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,500
 He still has a plan for you, a plan to prosper you.

923
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:22,460
 I do wanna pray for those you know you are working,

924
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,220
 you are pushed to work for your identity right now,

925
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,860
 you're struggling that today.

926
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:33,500
 I pray that you also invite you to just open up your hands

927
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,180
 and receive the Holy Spirit

928
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,500
 because God says it's His Holy Spirit

929
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,060
 that pours out His love so that you know

930
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,060
 you're secure in your sonship

931
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,220
 or in your relationship with Him as His sons and daughters.

932
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,100
 It's the work of the Holy Spirit.

933
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,260
 It's Him pouring out His love.

934
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,140
 It's His guarantee inside

935
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,660
 that you know for sure,

936
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,540
 you have that assurance that you are a child of God,

937
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,180
 that you could work from that identity.

938
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,260
 So just open your hands and receive the Holy Spirit

939
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,100
 and receive what He wants to do in your life right now.

940
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,980
 I thank you, Jesus.

941
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,100
 Thank you, Jesus.

942
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:22,260
 Why don't we stand and worship Him together?

943
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:32,260
