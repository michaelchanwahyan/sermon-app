1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 Well, I'm so glad you're here.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,200
 Welcome to the Vine.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,200
 My name's Andrew.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,040
 I'm one of the pastors here, and we're really grateful that you're here on the first Sunday

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,320
 of 2025.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
 Can you believe 2025?

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,160
 Pastor Ellison said to us this morning that there are people that are just being born

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,000
 recently who will see the year 3000.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,440
 Get your head around that.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,200
 Okay, only that blew me away.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
 Okay, whatever.

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,600
 I just thought that was cool.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,840
 My daughter might see the year 3000.

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,080
 Anyway, I really believe, as we're stepping into 2025, I really believe this.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,200
 We're about to begin what I believe is going to be the most significant year in the Vine's

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
 history.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,400
 I have so much excitement in my heart, so much longing for what I sense that God wants

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
 to do amongst us.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,560
 I believe that this will be our most significant year in the history of this church.

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,800
 And I want to say this, I think it's going to be your most significant year too, because

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,420
 the church isn't an institution.

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,840
 It's not an organization, although we sometimes need those things in the fabric and structures

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
 of churches.

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,360
 But the church, if it's anything, is the people.

25
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,040
 And I believe that this can be, will be, and I'll say it in a prophetic way over you, your

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
 most significant year ever.

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,960
 And I don't know how you feel as you step into 2025.

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,440
 Perhaps some of you in here, you feel excited and expectant.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,320
 Maybe some of you feel cautious.

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,260
 Maybe you're a bit careful as you step in.

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,680
 Maybe 2024 was a difficult, challenging year, and you're not sure how 2025 is going to go.

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,840
 And you're sort of tentatively stepping into the year.

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,320
 Whether you're stepping into this year with excitement or whether you're a little bit

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,000
 cautious, here's what I do know.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,980
 That the God that we worship and we serve is a God whose primary purpose is the movement

36
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:52,000
 of God's people forward into a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,240
 The primary focus that we have from God is to move his people forward to become more

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,840
 and more like Christ Jesus.

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,120
 And if that is true, then surely this year has every chance to be your most significant

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
 year ever.

41
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,160
 Because we don't serve a God who's going backwards.

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,400
 Come on church.

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,560
 We don't serve a God who's heading back somewhere.

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,860
 We serve a God who always moves forward, and therefore the church is always moving forward.

45
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,120
 And actually the work of the Spirit is always to come and transform and change us.

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,280
 Yes, so that we are transformed, but almost more than that, so that we would become an

47
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,920
 influence in our city, in our workplaces, in the places that we have an influence for

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,240
 his kingdom, for the gospel, for the hope that is in Christ Jesus.

49
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:49,840
 In other words, God changes you so that you can partner with him in changing the world.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,720
 And I want you to hear this not in some sort of puffed up kind of, "Oh, it's the new year.

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,240
 We're going to change the world."

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,600
 Only Jesus changes the world.

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,080
 You don't change the world.

54
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,920
 Jesus changes the world.

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,600
 But here's the most profound thing.

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,280
 It is Jesus that changes the world, but he's decided to do it through the church, through

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,280
 us, through broken vessels, through the ones that don't always have the answers, through

58
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,460
 the ones that don't always get it right, through the ones that have sin and are wrestling

59
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
 with sin.

60
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,180
 God has decided in his infinite wisdom to choose the broken vessels of this world to

61
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,840
 bring his spirit and his hope and his gospel into the world.

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,400
 And if God is moving forward, oh, how we should be moving forward.

63
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,940
 We should be a church with momentum, a church on the go.

64
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,480
 And so however you feel as you step into this year, and let's be honest, 2025, there's going

65
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,720
 to be some challenges.

66
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,400
 We know that there are challenges in the world right now, geopolitically, and perhaps there

67
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,520
 are going to get worse as we go forward.

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,280
 And maybe you recognize that there are some challenges and some struggles in your own

69
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,560
 life right now.

70
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,600
 This is personal for you.

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,320
 You also feel personal challenges.

72
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,320
 Whatever challenges you might be facing, we cannot start this year in retreat.

73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,480
 We cannot start this year defeated.

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,880
 Because if our God is a God of momentum, moving his people forward to become more like Christ

75
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,200
 Jesus, then surely we have to start this year saying, "I'm ready to go."

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
 Okay.

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 Try that again.

78
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 No, I won't.

79
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,200
 I'm not even going to try it again.

80
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
 Okay.

81
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
 We're just going to carry on.

82
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
 Now, listen to this.

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,840
 If we're going to be a church in Hong Kong that takes the gospel seriously in 2025, we

84
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,040
 have to take Jesus's word seriously.

85
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,920
 And Jesus, right at the end of his life, gathers his disciples up on that mountain, doesn't

86
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
 he?

87
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,800
 And before his ascension, he's resurrected.

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,320
 So he's in his resurrection power, but it's before he ascends and he gathers his most

89
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,400
 faithful disciples around him.

90
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,760
 There were 11 of them at that time.

91
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,160
 And he speaks into them and he says these words.

92
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,080
 He says, "All authority on heaven and earth has been given to me.

93
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,560
 So now stay here."

94
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
 No, he didn't say that.

95
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,640
 He did say that in a minute because he says, "Stay and wait for the Holy Spirit."

96
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,520
 But in this moment, he says, "Now go.

97
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
 Go.

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
 I'm sending you," he says.

99
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,440
 And you want to know what I'm sending you to do?

100
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,000
 He says, "I want you to make disciples of all the nations.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,920
 I want you to baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

102
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,200
 And then I want you to teach them to obey everything that I've commanded you.

103
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
 And here's the kicker.

104
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,740
 I will be with you.

105
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,960
 Every step of the way, I will be with you."

106
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,080
 So Jesus says, one of his last words to his disciples is, "I have all authority and power.

107
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,160
 So here's what I'm saying to you as the church.

108
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
 I want you to go.

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,440
 I want you to go forward in that authority and power that is invested into you through

110
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,960
 the work of the Holy Spirit."

111
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,560
 That's why he says, "Wait and do this until you receive the Holy Spirit.

112
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,760
 Once you have that Holy Spirit, you are to go."

113
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,240
 And so we must be a church on the move.

114
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
 Does that make sense?

115
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,540
 A church with mission.

116
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:58,640
 So if 2025 is anything for the vine, it should be a year of action.

117
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,820
 Now I want to just say that this is not some new calling for us.

118
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,820
 This is not like some new vision or some fresh idea at the start of the year.

119
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,680
 This has actually been birthed by the Holy Spirit in our community over multiple years

120
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,880
 of what the Lord's been doing amongst us.

121
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,840
 In fact, I want to actually pull the threads together a little bit this morning and help

122
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360
 you to see what the Holy Spirit has been doing in us as a community.

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,620
 In 2022, we felt called to heal.

124
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,760
 It was right off the back of COVID.

125
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,400
 And we felt like the Holy Spirit said to us, 2022 is going to be a year of healing.

126
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,800
 A year of gathering back together for the first time after all that pandemic, after

127
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,600
 all the social distancing, even after the social movement that had happened in 2019

128
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
 and 2020.

129
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
 As we gathered back together physically for the first time in 2022, we knew that we were

130
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,000
 being called to heal.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 That all of us were carrying some baggage.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,320
 In fact, one of the things that we said to us that year is that we need to shake the

133
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
 dust off.

134
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,520
 We all had gotten a little bit dusty and it was great to get back together again in 2022.

135
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,760
 Then in 2023, we felt God call us to Exodus.

136
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,640
 We actually spent a whole year pretty much studying the book of Exodus in Scripture.

137
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,880
 And in that book, we saw so many profound, important things for us as Christians.

138
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,200
 How God wants to bring us on a journey out of our slavery to sin into newness and freedom,

139
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,760
 into a promised land that he has given to us.

140
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,520
 And we taught that year that Hong Kong is that promised land for us.

141
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,040
 And that we need to be an Exodus people.

142
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,840
 People that have been called out of slavery of sin into new life in Christ so that we

143
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,320
 can enter our promised land and do the things that God has on his heart for us to do.

144
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
 That was 2023.

145
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,680
 But then in 2024, we said, God is calling us to intimacy.

146
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,120
 That was the word we had for us as a church that whole year.

147
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,520
 Now that made sense because you know what happened in Exodus.

148
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,840
 God calls his people out of their slavery into sin and he calls them out in order to

149
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,720
 call them in to his presence on Mount Sinai.

150
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,760
 Remember that if you're around here in 2023, we were called out of our slavery in to his

151
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,240
 presence around Mount Sinai.

152
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,640
 And so it followed that a year of Exodus would follow in 2024 to a year of intimacy.

153
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,760
 And we invited you to connect deeply with God, to have time with Jesus, to make it a

154
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,920
 priority to fall more in love with Christ.

155
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,700
 I had the blessing of having a sabbatical last year.

156
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,480
 And so that was a great way for me to do that.

157
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,240
 And I know that many of us did that in lots of different ways.

158
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,840
 It was a year of intimacy.

159
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,600
 But here's the important thing.

160
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,960
 As a leadership, even though we discern that God was calling us into intimacy, we knew

161
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,660
 that that intimacy was actually on behalf of a bigger purpose.

162
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,960
 And while it was important that we would connect with Jesus, fall more in love with him, spend

163
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,080
 more time with him last year, it was always on behalf of something else.

164
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,640
 What you have to understand in scripture is that intimacy is a platform, not a destination.

165
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,880
 Come on church.

166
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,720
 Intimacy is a platform, not a destination.

167
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,520
 Jesus actually said in John 15, where we get the name of the vine from, the very passage

168
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,520
 that we get it from, he says, "If you abide in me, you will bear much fruit."

169
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,360
 Now there's this stuff that will happen out of the intimacy you have with me.

170
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,520
 So intimacy is this platform through which and from which we are able to serve.

171
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,480
 If we serve without the intimacy, we will burn out.

172
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,240
 But if we abide in him, we are able to do more in our city, more in the world around

173
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,200
 us out of that abiding in him.

174
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
 So intimacy is a platform, not a destination.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,520
 Does that make sense to you?

176
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,720
 So that is why as we head into 2025, we knew that intimacy was not always going to be there.

177
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,680
 We knew that actually this year is a call to action.

178
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,360
 This is to take that fruit that hopefully every single one of us has received last year

179
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,200
 and begin to sow that fruit into our workplaces, into the places of influence that we have,

180
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,600
 into the city that we love so much.

181
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,720
 We are called this year out of intimacy into action.

182
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,280
 That doesn't mean that we let go of intimacy.

183
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,200
 It doesn't mean that that was a 2024 thing.

184
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,160
 You don't need to be intimate with Jesus anymore.

185
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,280
 We have to abide in him, remain in him, but we have to shift our mentality from just being

186
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,480
 with him to being with him for a purpose, being with him so that we can partner with

187
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,880
 him to change the world.

188
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,800
 Does that make sense to you?

189
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,480
 Okay, now that flow is where our challenge lies.

190
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,120
 Here's the challenge.

191
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,420
 It's not easy to go from intimacy to action because intimacy is good.

192
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,960
 Intimacy is comfortable.

193
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,520
 Intimacy is awesome.

194
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,800
 It was great to stand up last year and say, "Hey, be more intimate with Jesus."

195
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,480
 You were all like, "Yes!"

196
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
 Now I'm standing up and saying, "Hey, take the gospel to your workplace."

197
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,160
 And you're like, "Hmm, that's a little bit different, right?"

198
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,280
 It's easier to remain in a place of intimacy because intimacy is awesome.

199
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
 It's comfortable.

200
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
 It's good.

201
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,880
 But then stepping out of intimacy into action, that requires a shift.

202
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,700
 That requires something new.

203
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,600
 That's not a straightforward transition.

204
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
 And so here's what we want to do at the start of 2025.

205
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,280
 If God is calling us to a year of action, then how do we go from intimacy to action

206
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
 well?

207
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,680
 And over the next four Sundays, we're going to actually explore that with you.

208
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,000
 And we're going to look at Samuel and David.

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,040
 The reason why we're looking at Samuel and David in the Old Testament is because they

210
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,840
 both went through times of intimacy into action in their lives.

211
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,180
 And so we're going to see how they do that transition to help us understand ours.

212
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,760
 But also they go through what I would say are mindset changes in order to do the things

213
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,720
 that God has called them to do.

214
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,720
 They had old mindsets that they needed to let go of in order to embrace a new mindset

215
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,160
 to be able to do what it is that God had for them to do.

216
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,000
 And I think it's the same also for us.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,760
 I think we need some mindset changes as we step into 2025 for the things that God has

218
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,600
 for the vine to do in its future.

219
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,200
 And again, by that, has for you to do in your spirit of influence.

220
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,840
 And so we're going to talk about four things.

221
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,080
 Next week we're going to talk about having the right choices.

222
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
 We talk about choices.

223
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,840
 A week after that, we're going to talk about having the right kind of resources in our

224
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,160
 lives and how we're using those resources.

225
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,080
 We're going to talk about after that, the right community and the people that we have

226
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,400
 around us and are they the right people that we have around us.

227
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,500
 And then finally, or actually today, we're going to talk about having the right start.

228
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,280
 How do we actually begin?

229
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,840
 How do we get our starting point right?

230
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,140
 Because here's the thing.

231
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,120
 If you don't start from the right place, you're going to easily drift.

232
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,200
 How do we make sure we're all starting in exactly the place that we should start?

233
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,320
 The question is, how do we begin?

234
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
 Well, let me tell you something that I think is really important as we begin to think about

235
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,920
 a mindset shift.

236
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,400
 Psychologists, counselors, therapists, they will tell you that there are five emotional

237
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,280
 barriers that all of us have, or all of us struggle with at some point.

238
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:02,760
 Five emotional barriers that actually block us, inhibit us, stop us from moving forward

239
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,360
 in whatever it might be in our human life.

240
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,640
 Whether that might be moving forward into a new job, moving forward into a new relationship,

241
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,480
 moving forward into a goal or a dream we have.

242
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,880
 There are five emotional barriers that will stop you, inhibit you, slow you down from

243
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
 your forward momentum.

244
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
 Does that make sense?

245
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,440
 You want to know what those five are?

246
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,800
 Hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure.

247
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,600
 Say it again, hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, failure.

248
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,480
 Those five things are the emotional barriers that will inhibit you from moving forward

249
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,160
 with excitement into a new thing in your life.

250
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,160
 When hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure are upon us, are a part of us,

251
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,920
 they become barriers to our growth.

252
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,720
 Does that make sense to you?

253
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
 Now here's the thing.

254
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,440
 They're not just barriers to our general human movement.

255
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,640
 They're also barriers spiritually as well.

256
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,800
 In fact, you can go to the Bible and you can see many examples of God's people struggling

257
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,840
 with hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure.

258
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,680
 And that in the struggle, they find themselves held back from what it is that God wants to

259
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
 do with them.

260
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,780
 And they find it difficult to shift out of the old and into the new.

261
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:27,640
 And the burden that I felt sitting on me as I was preparing this message today is that

262
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,960
 I feel like for me, but I also feel like for many of us here, many of us watching online

263
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,420
 right now, here's the reality.

264
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,640
 Because hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure has had such an impact on us at

265
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,840
 times, we actually think that we're kind of on plan B now for our lives.

266
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,720
 It's like, that was really hard.

267
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,660
 I went through a really traumatic time, or I had a really bad breakdown in a relationship,

268
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,060
 or I tried a job and I got fired and it was really, really hard for me.

269
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,620
 And we have these situations where we're sitting heavy with the weight of our brokenness from

270
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,700
 something that's happened in our past.

271
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,060
 That hurt and that disappointment, that shame and that regret, that kind of tethers us,

272
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,240
 anchors us to that.

273
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,060
 And we begin to think, well, I guess I'll just live a plan B kind of life then.

274
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,140
 I guess the only life that's really available for me now is not the life that I hoped for,

275
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,020
 not the life that I believe that God had put in my heart.

276
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,420
 I guess that's kind of failed.

277
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
 That hasn't worked out.

278
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,740
 So I guess I'm going to live a half life.

279
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,100
 It's still a pretty decent one, but it's not quite the one that I was hoping it would be.

280
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,420
 And particularly when we're dealing out of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure

281
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:41,220
 because of sin, we then get the mentality of, I'm not worthy of the life that Christ

282
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,700
 wants me to have.

283
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,900
 I'm not worthy to be used by him in the way that he wants to use me.

284
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,940
 I hear Pastor Andrew on a Sunday and the other pastors speak.

285
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,100
 I read the Bible and I see what God does in other people, but that's everybody else's

286
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,100
 story.

287
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,660
 If they knew the sin that was in my life, they would know that that's not my story and

288
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,460
 that shouldn't be my story.

289
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,820
 Are you with me?

290
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,180
 And so because of that, we think we're on plan B or maybe some of us plan C, D, E, and

291
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,060
 F.

292
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,700
 And you have no anticipation as you step into 2025 that actually maybe you're still

293
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,500
 on plan A. That actually the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure does not have to

294
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,140
 determine your future.

295
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:31,020
 See, when the hurt, disappointment, shame, and failure of our past speaks louder to us

296
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:37,180
 than the hope of our future, we are always in danger of missing out on the most significant

297
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,060
 moments of influence and impact we can have in this world.

298
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,740
 Always in danger of missing out on the most significant moments of impact and influence

299
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,180
 that we could have in the world around us.

300
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:56,380
 And I don't want a church, and I don't think you do either, that is so tethered to its

301
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:03,580
 brokenness of its past that it isn't impacting and influencing the world in the way that

302
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,860
 the cross of Calvary says it should.

303
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,940
 Jesus said, "I have built this church.

304
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,860
 I will build this church, and the gates of hell will not pervade against it."

305
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,420
 And as we step into this new year, I wonder whether we could step in actually believing

306
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
 that.

307
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
 Amen?

308
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,020
 So if you struggle with hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure, you're human,

309
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,340
 number one.

310
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,060
 Number two, you're just like me.

311
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,740
 And number three, the scripture has something important to say to you.

312
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,940
 I want to frame that by sharing with you about the story of Samuel.

313
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,140
 I don't know if you know much about Samuel in the Old Testament.

314
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
 Samuel lived this incredible life.

315
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,980
 I'm going to pick up the story right at the end of Samuel's life though, because I want

316
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,940
 to show you the transition that takes place here.

317
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,380
 Right at the end of Samuel's life, he's so old that the leaders of Israel come to him

318
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,220
 and they say these very words, "You are very old."

319
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,380
 Can you imagine that?

320
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,300
 Imagine your boss coming up to you saying, "You are very old."

321
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,620
 So basically, he's at the end of his life.

322
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,140
 And here's the thing you need to know about Samuel.

323
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,180
 He's lived an amazing life.

324
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,860
 This guy has lived an incredible life.

325
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,220
 He's been a judge of Israel for the majority of his life.

326
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,980
 And as a judge, he was the leader of the nation at that time.

327
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,780
 Now you can see in the book of Judges, the book of 1 and 2 Kings and all this, you can

328
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,220
 see that actually the judges really struggled, many of them, with sin and brokenness, and

329
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,060
 they didn't lead God's people very well.

330
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,740
 Samuel, however, did.

331
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,260
 He's one of the few judges that was actually upright, who actually had moral integrity,

332
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,580
 who actually loved God, who actually served Him and obeyed His Word.

333
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,100
 And he did an incredible job with Israel.

334
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,420
 And at the end of his life, success becomes a problem for him.

335
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,220
 Anybody else in this room, has that ever been in your case?

336
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,220
 Just me?

337
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,220
 No, it's okay.

338
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,820
 Success can become a problem, right?

339
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,120
 And so for him, he's done this amazing job, but he's done it so well that the leaders

340
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,980
 of Israel come to him and say, "You're very old," which means you're going to die soon,

341
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,020
 which means your sons will become judges, but your sons are not like you.

342
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,420
 Your sons don't have the same character you do.

343
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,300
 Your sons are not the same upright integrity that you have.

344
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,580
 We don't want your sons to lead us.

345
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,540
 And because we don't want your sons to lead us, here's what we want you to do.

346
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,320
 We want you to anoint a king.

347
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,180
 We want to start a monarchy now.

348
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,380
 We want to be like the other nations that we see, who have kings and queens.

349
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,860
 We want that for ourselves too.

350
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,900
 We do not want your son, Samuel.

351
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,900
 Oh, you've been a great judge, but you've been a terrible father.

352
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,900
 Imagine how...

353
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
 They didn't actually say that.

354
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,060
 I added that to scripture, but I think that's kind of what they were saying.

355
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,980
 Could you imagine how hurt Samuel would be?

356
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,180
 I mean, he's given his life to these people.

357
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,540
 He served them as best as he can.

358
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,240
 And right at the end of his life, the people have come and said, "We don't want your family

359
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,420
 anymore."

360
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,700
 The hurt, the disappointment.

361
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,260
 I think he was hurt because he wanted to defend his sons, I'm sure.

362
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,620
 But I think he was hurt more than that because he felt like he had been rejected by his people,

363
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,620
 him personally.

364
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,060
 In fact, we know that because he comes to God and it's recorded for us in scripture.

365
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,220
 He comes to God and he prays a prayer.

366
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,620
 He says this, he says, "Lord, I'm distraught because they have rejected me."

367
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,540
 And God, in only the way that God can, comes to him and says, "No, no, no, no, Samuel,

368
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,740
 they've not rejected you.

369
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,060
 They've rejected me as king over them."

370
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:25,380
 In other words, God always saw himself as their king, as the ultimate ruler.

371
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,500
 And when they came and asked for a king, God was like, "They're trying to assert my power

372
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
 and my authority.

373
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,020
 They haven't rejected you, Samuel.

374
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,980
 They've actually rejected me."

375
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,660
 And God, because he's compassionate and loving and faithful and committed, he says these

376
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
 words to Samuel.

377
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,780
 He said, "Look, if they want a monarchy, we can work through a monarchy."

378
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,620
 He's basically like, "My redemptive purposes are not going to be thwarted by some human

379
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,620
 idea.

380
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,700
 If it's a monarchy they want, a monarchy can happen.

381
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,300
 I can still bring my redemptive purposes to the world through that."

382
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,420
 And so he says this thing to Samuel.

383
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,020
 He says, "Samuel, I want you to pick up your horn.

384
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,180
 I want you to fill it with oil.

385
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,580
 And then I want you to pour it over the one I'm about to anoint as king."

386
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,620
 Now, for Samuel, he, as a prophet and judge, he would have a horn, not too dissimilar to

387
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,380
 something like this.

388
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,300
 And in the horn, what he would do is he would pour anointing oil, perfumed oil into it.

389
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,440
 And then he would choose an amazingly good-looking man like this man right here.

390
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,740
 And he would come up to him and he would say, "Okay, the Lord's going to use this man for

391
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,740
 leadership."

392
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,220
 And he would pour that anointing oil over his head.

393
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,380
 And that was a prophetic symbol to say that this person has now been anointed to lead

394
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,360
 or to be a prophet or whatever it is.

395
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,260
 So when God says to Samuel, "Grab your horn, fill it with oil because I'm about to use

396
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,460
 it," it's saying to Samuel, "There's one more thing I want you to do.

397
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,860
 You're very old, but there's one more thing.

398
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,860
 You can hold your horn.

399
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
 You can do what I'm asking you to do."

400
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,220
 And so he goes, "I want you to go and anoint this guy called Saul."

401
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,260
 And so he goes to Saul and he anoints Saul.

402
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,140
 Now, Saul says these beautiful words when he's anointed.

403
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,300
 He says, "Who am I that I would be chosen out of all of Israel to be the one?

404
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,500
 Like my clan is the smallest, my tribe is the smallest.

405
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,940
 I can't believe I've been chosen."

406
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,960
 There's this beautiful humility in Saul.

407
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,840
 And everything in the story at this point seems to be going quite well.

408
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,260
 And then Saul begins to lead.

409
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:14,540
 Now, I don't know if you've ever tried to lead, but leadership is not easy.

410
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,980
 And he gets seduced by power, not the only or first leader in the world to have been

411
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,500
 seduced by power.

412
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,420
 He gets seduced so much by power.

413
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,940
 He gets a taste of it so much that within a short period of time begins to erect statues

414
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,620
 of himself around all of the cities of the land because he wanted his people to begin

415
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,580
 to look to him for authority rather than to look to God.

416
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,300
 "They've not rejected you, Samuel.

417
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,420
 They rejected me as king."

418
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,060
 And Saul begins to live a life where he actually begins to disobey the things that God is asking

419
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,060
 him to do.

420
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,220
 Erect statues for people to basically essentially worship him, to look to him.

421
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,980
 And this so grieves heart of God, so grieves God's heart that he comes to Samuel and he

422
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,260
 says, "Samuel, I'm so grieved that I have made Saul king over Israel.

423
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,500
 I'm lifting my anointing from him."

424
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,860
 This throws Samuel into another cycle.

425
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,580
 And this cycle is regret, shame, and failure.

426
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:17,660
 Because suddenly Samuel's feeling like this, "I'm at the end of my life and I've just anointed

427
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,700
 the last, the last act that I've done in my life is to anoint this one to be king.

428
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,900
 I've then stood aside.

429
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,660
 My family has stood aside.

430
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,340
 We've made space for this to happen.

431
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,660
 And this guy has been seduced by power.

432
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,620
 And now God has lifted his anointing."

433
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:37,140
 Samuel's feeling like, "My last act of life has been a failure.

434
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,820
 The last thing I've done has failed.

435
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,100
 It hasn't worked out.

436
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,620
 What kind of prophet, what kind of judge, what kind of leader, what kind of legacy am

437
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,860
 I leaving behind when the last thing I did didn't work out well?"

438
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:56,940
 The shame, the shame of being the one that actually anointed the wrong person, if you

439
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,660
 will, the one who grieves the heart of the Lord.

440
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,860
 How did that all happen?

441
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:08,300
 And Samuel is so wallowing deeply in his brokenness, in the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret,

442
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:16,620
 and failure of what's just happened to him that he is completely at a loss.

443
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,500
 I wonder if you've ever felt that way.

444
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,140
 I wonder if you've ever had a moment in your life where maybe something you've done in

445
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:31,060
 your past has so filled you with regret, so filled you with hurt that you're filled with

446
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,820
 shame just thinking about it.

447
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,180
 And that whole thing, you've either tried to ignore it, tried to bury it, tried to avoid

448
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,940
 it, or it's so consumed you that it's been difficult for you to get out of bed the next

449
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
 day.

450
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,420
 I wonder if it's just me who's felt that way.

451
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,980
 I'm sure all of us, right?

452
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,180
 To some degree can connect to where Samuel is in this moment.

453
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,060
 Perhaps for you, it's a relationship.

454
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,100
 Perhaps you've got a failed relationship in your life, maybe a failed marriage.

455
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,140
 And the hurt of that, the disappointment in that, the shame of that's holding you back.

456
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
 Perhaps it's a work thing.

457
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,060
 Maybe you tried for a job and you didn't get the job, or maybe you had a job and you got

458
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,700
 fired or you lost your job or you were made redundant or something, and that's sitting

459
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,600
 heavy on you.

460
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,880
 Perhaps it's a financial decision.

461
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,500
 You made an investment in something and that investment didn't work out.

462
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,460
 You put it all in and it didn't come through.

463
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,740
 And that still stings and you're still embarrassed about that.

464
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,380
 And you feel like you hurt your loved ones because you made a choice that didn't work

465
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,380
 out, that it failed.

466
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,800
 I think we all can connect with Samuel in some way, can't we?

467
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,300
 God shows up to Samuel in this place of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure.

468
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,100
 And he speaks to him some words that if you're feeling anything like what Samuel was feeling

469
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,800
 in that moment, I think God's saying these words over you today, because these words

470
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,880
 change everything for Samuel.

471
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,540
 And as I unpack them for you now, I pray that they will change everything for you and that

472
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,380
 you will be able to start 2025 walking forward.

473
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,660
 Let me read this to you from 1 Samuel, starting in verse, chapter 15, starting in verse 34.

474
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,260
 And I'm just going to read a few verses.

475
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,620
 Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gebeah of Saul.

476
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:22,260
 For the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for

477
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,260
 him.

478
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,180
 And the Lord was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.

479
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,880
 The Lord said to Samuel, "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him

480
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,780
 as king over Israel?

481
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,820
 Fill your horn with oil and be on your way, for I'm sending you now to Jesse of Bethlehem,

482
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,980
 for I have chosen one of his sons to be king."

483
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,180
 So I want you to picture this.

484
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,340
 Samuel was in a place of hurt, disappointment, reject, shame, and failure.

485
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,180
 He's right at the end of his life and he thinks his life is done.

486
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,340
 Everything's done.

487
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,220
 And he's mourning, grieving, hurting for all the things that have just happened at the

488
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,220
 end of his life.

489
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,620
 And God shows up and says these words.

490
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,620
 Let me read this again.

491
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,700
 "How long will you mourn for Saul?"

492
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,200
 I want you to see a couple of things here.

493
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,500
 Notice what God doesn't say.

494
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,580
 God does not say, "Why are you mourning for Saul?"

495
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,380
 He says, "How long will you mourn for Saul?"

496
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,060
 It's a subtle but very important difference.

497
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,260
 Could you imagine if you were Samuel and you're feeling the worst that you've ever felt in

498
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,340
 your life?

499
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,060
 You're feeling a failure, you're burnt out, you're feeling like what you've just done

500
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,140
 just didn't work out.

501
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,140
 And God shows up and says, "Why?

502
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,140
 Why are you feeling that way?"

503
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,500
 Can you imagine how that would feel?

504
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,220
 I mean, that would be a bit weird, wouldn't it?

505
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,460
 God was saying, "Why are you doing that?

506
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,460
 Why would you do that?

507
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
 You shouldn't do that.

508
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
 I've given up on that one.

509
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,460
 I gave up on him way ago.

510
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,460
 I've rejected him.

511
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,460
 Come on.

512
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
 Why are you feeling this way?"

513
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,540
 It's so beautiful to me that God doesn't show up to Samuel and say, "Why are you feeling

514
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
 this way?"

515
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,260
 Instead, he shows up to him and goes, "I understand why you're feeling this way.

516
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,700
 Like I totally get it.

517
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
 You're in a place of mourning.

518
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,820
 I'm not asking you why you're in a place of mourning because I know you're human and you've

519
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,820
 just gone through something that was really hard and you feel the shame and you feel the

520
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,900
 embarrassment and you feel the brokenness and I get it, you're mourning."

521
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,620
 And I think it's beautiful because in God saying, "How long will you mourn?"

522
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,020
 Notice God is giving him space to mourn.

523
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,020
 He's giving him space to wrestle with that feeling.

524
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,620
 He's giving him a space to process what has happened to him.

525
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,460
 He's not expecting him to get immediately better.

526
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,580
 How long will you mourn saying, basically, "There's a place for mourning."

527
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,580
 Hear this, church.

528
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,300
 "There's a place for mourning.

529
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,460
 There's a place to wrestle with the brokenness, to wrestle with the things that we've done

530
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,460
 that we're not proud of.

531
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,740
 There's a place to bring our sin before the Lord and not to have to walk in the brokenness

532
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
 anymore.

533
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,660
 There's a place to receive the forgiveness and the healing and the restoration.

534
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,020
 There's a place for mourning."

535
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,860
 This is why we have the Psalms in the Scriptures because the Psalms are the beautiful poetic

536
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,980
 voice of Israel saying, "Hey, it's okay.

537
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,140
 We feel this way, God.

538
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,540
 We feel this way, but we're going to trust.

539
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,740
 We know that you're still for us even though it feels like you're a long, long way away

540
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,460
 from us, even though you've kind of forsaken us."

541
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:11,740
 The Psalms are this beautiful, honest reflection of God's people crying out and saying, "We're

542
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,740
 hurting.

543
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,980
 This is not easy.

544
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,820
 This is a painful experience."

545
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,060
 And God is saying, "There's space for that."

546
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,020
 Jesus himself in Matthew 5, 4, in the Sermon on the Mount, he says these beautiful words.

547
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,140
 He says, "Blessed are those who are mourned for they will be comforted."

548
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,700
 Blessed are those who mourn.

549
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,420
 Blessed are those that process the hurt and the feelings in them.

550
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,700
 For I, here's my promise to them, I promise I will comfort them.

551
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,700
 I promise my spirit will be there for them.

552
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,460
 I promise they will not go through it alone.

553
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,380
 That's the wonderful heart of God.

554
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,300
 And so I want to say this to some of you in this room.

555
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,380
 Some of you here are in a season of mourning.

556
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,740
 And I want to say that's absolutely good.

557
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
 That's fine.

558
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,260
 In fact, your season of mourning is your greatest opportunity to receive the comfort of the

559
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,940
 presence of Jesus.

560
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,100
 And so if you're in a season of mourning in this room, our prayer for you is that we will

561
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,100
 be with you.

562
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,100
 We'll stand with you.

563
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,420
 We'll be the support to you.

564
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,780
 We will pray for you and we will hope that the comfort of Christ will be known in your

565
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,780
 life.

566
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,780
 We'll journey with you forever, however long it takes.

567
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,180
 If you're mourning here, we love you and we're here for you.

568
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,660
 Are you with me?

569
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,860
 I don't want you to hear anything else if that's your season right now.

570
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,820
 The only thing I want you to take away from today is that God will comfort you.

571
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,260
 Jesus will comfort you.

572
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,860
 And we as a church, we're here for you.

573
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,460
 But I want you to see this.

574
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,420
 By God coming to Samuel and saying, "How long are you going to mourn?"

575
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,120
 God understands something that Samuel needed to understand.

576
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,700
 And it's really important that at some point, mourning has to finish for new life to begin.

577
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,820
 Come on church.

578
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:54,100
 At some point, mourning has to stop for new life to begin.

579
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,540
 I don't know how you sleep at night.

580
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
 Let me explain.

581
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
 We're going to get intimate now.

582
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,220
 I'm going to explain to you how I sleep at night.

583
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,340
 When I sleep at night, I sleep with my arms under the pillow.

584
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,340
 Anyone ever do that?

585
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,780
 Like you put your arms under your pillow, whether two arms or one arm.

586
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,660
 I like to sleep with one arm under my pillow.

587
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,140
 Now the problem with that is about twice a night, I will wake up in the middle of the

588
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,580
 night and I've been leaning my whole body weight on one arm.

589
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,380
 And that means that arm is now dead.

590
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,340
 Like all the blood has been pushed out of that arm.

591
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,900
 You ever had like a dead arm, right?

592
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,460
 And if you're leaning on it and your arm is dead, the funny thing is you can't kind of

593
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,180
 move because you can't push off.

594
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,860
 So you have to get your other hand and sort of push off the mattress.

595
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,780
 And then your hand just sort of stays there and then you've got to grab it and it sort

596
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,140
 of flops like this because there's no blood in it.

597
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,060
 And then you move on to your other side and about two hours later you wake up and that

598
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,580
 arm's dead, right?

599
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,380
 This is like a repetitive thing in my life.

600
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,580
 When God comes to Samuel and says, "How long are you going to mourn?"

601
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,500
 He's basically saying we do this with ourselves spiritually.

602
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,580
 We do this with ourselves emotionally.

603
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,340
 When we hold on to the mourning of something for too long, it's like that thing remains

604
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,340
 dead.

605
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
 You remain dead.

606
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,740
 And for new life to come, you have to let go at some point.

607
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,860
 You have to move forward at some point.

608
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,220
 And he comes to Samuel and says, "How long are you going to mourn?"

609
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:18,060
 Which is actually an invitation for Samuel to both mourn, yes, but also to realize that

610
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,380
 at some point that's going to have to stop and that God will be there for him.

611
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,740
 And when God is there for him, things will begin to change.

612
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,900
 Some of you in this room, you're struggling to find a new relationship in your life because

613
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,660
 you're still holding on to the old one that's long been dead.

614
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,180
 Some of you are struggling to find that job that's your career job that you'd love to

615
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:42,060
 do because you're hanging on to the old job out of fear of a lack of security for the

616
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,060
 future.

617
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,660
 And you're holding on to the job you hate and that's keeping you from the job you really

618
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,700
 want to receive or what it might be in any area of our lives.

619
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,300
 But we can all go through this.

620
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,060
 And I want you to see something that's happening here.

621
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,940
 When God says to Samuel, "How long are you going to mourn?"

622
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,300
 Here's essentially what's happening for Samuel.

623
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,720
 Samuel is so consumed to the mourning of his past that he is ignorant.

624
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,420
 He's blind to the importance of his future.

625
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,340
 I want you to see this because this is what happens for all of us in these five emotional

626
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,340
 barriers.

627
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:16,300
 He's so consumed by the past that he's blind to the importance of his future.

628
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,900
 He thinks he has no future.

629
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,220
 He thinks his story is done.

630
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,180
 I anointed one and he failed.

631
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,320
 That's my postscript.

632
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,980
 I'm leaving this world with that.

633
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,820
 I am done.

634
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,700
 And God says, "You don't understand Samuel, but you are standing in this moment right

635
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,220
 in the most significant moment of human history."

636
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,120
 Samuel has no idea the importance of what's ahead of him, but God knows.

637
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,520
 And because God sees what is just ahead of Samuel, he says, "How long are you going to

638
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
 mourn?"

639
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,420
 Samuel's thinking, "Hang on a sec.

640
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,420
 Everything's done for me."

641
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,880
 And God's saying, "You can't see what it is that I'm about to do for you."

642
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
 Think about this.

643
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,080
 Samuel, and we're going to see this next week, Samuel is about to go and anoint, he's about

644
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,440
 to pour oil over David.

645
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:13,340
 David, who would become the starting point of the Davidic dynasty that Jewish people

646
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,900
 and Christians believe, or Jewish people believe will come eventually for a Messiah, Christians

647
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,460
 believe came in Jesus.

648
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,340
 Samuel is about to pour oil over the very one who will start the bloodline that will

649
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,660
 bring Jesus Christ.

650
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,940
 Get your head around that.

651
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,420
 Samuel is about to start the process for Jesus.

652
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
 He has no idea.

653
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:39,820
 He has no idea that he's standing at the most critical moment of human history because he's

654
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,340
 so blinded by the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure.

655
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,340
 But God sees.

656
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,800
 I want you to see this church.

657
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,400
 God sees.

658
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,180
 God sees David.

659
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,080
 God sees the bloodline.

660
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,400
 God sees Jesus.

661
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,940
 And God sees Jesus' life and ministry and miracles and teaching.

662
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,140
 He sees his death on the cross and the horror of that.

663
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,140
 And the importance of that for liberation for sin.

664
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,860
 He sees his resurrection and the filling of the Holy Spirit upon him.

665
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,220
 He sees him gathering disciples and giving them the great commission.

666
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,960
 He sees them receiving the Holy Spirit in the upper room.

667
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,300
 He sees them begin the church with their own sweat and blood.

668
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,060
 Some of them martyred for their faith.

669
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,960
 He sees over 2000 years, the church grow in history.

670
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,780
 He even sees the first Sunday of 2025 and you sitting at the vine, hearing the message

671
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,780
 right now.

672
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,460
 He sees all of that.

673
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,380
 And because of the worth and the value of all of that, he comes to Samuel and he says,

674
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,620
 "How long?

675
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,780
 How long?

676
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:50,820
 How long are you going to mourn because Jesus is coming?"

677
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,340
 It's really important.

678
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,620
 I think that we all hear this.

679
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:02,420
 Some of us have Davids right up and ahead of us in our future, but we're in danger of

680
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,580
 failing to receive them because we're still holding onto our souls.

681
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:15,220
 Which soul as you start 2025, are you holding onto that is blinding you to the wonder of

682
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,060
 what the Lord wants to do in you?

683
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:25,260
 The David that's there, your dream job, a new relationship, maybe a goal that you've

684
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,620
 longed had for.

685
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,820
 Maybe that moment of life that you've been dreaming and praying for, that budding of

686
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,900
 the bamboo shoot that's going to come out of the ground.

687
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,700
 It's right there in front of you.

688
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,340
 He sees it.

689
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:44,260
 And he says, "How long are you going to mourn?"

690
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,420
 How do we then respond to this?

691
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,180
 Well, notice what he says to Samuel chapter 16, verse one.

692
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,020
 He says, "The Lord said to Samuel, 'How long will you mourn for Saul since I've rejected

693
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,940
 him as king over Israel?

694
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,300
 Fill your horn with oil and be on your way.'"

695
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,460
 Isn't that a beautiful thing?

696
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,960
 See Samuel thought it was all over.

697
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,540
 My last act as a judge was to pour oil over Saul.

698
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,580
 What a mistake that was.

699
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,380
 I'm never doing that again.

700
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,860
 Oh, I don't want to take the risk of that again.

701
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,860
 Oh, if I step out and try that again, oh man, that's going to fail.

702
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,860
 I did that once and it sucked.

703
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,940
 It sucked so hard because God's heart was grieved.

704
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
 My heart was grieved.

705
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,420
 I hurt, shame, disappointment, failure.

706
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,540
 Why would I ever bother to do that again?

707
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,260
 You could imagine Samuel thinking.

708
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:37,140
 And God says, "Have the courage, Samuel, to pick up your horn, fill it with oil and be

709
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
 on your way."

710
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,780
 In other words, here's what Samuel hears.

711
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,780
 I love this.

712
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,100
 Samuel hears God say to him, "I am not done with you yet."

713
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
 Come on, church.

714
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,980
 "I'm not done with you yet.

715
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,140
 Who told you I was finished with you?

716
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,700
 You told yourself that.

717
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,060
 You let the hurt, shame, disappointment, regret, frame, failure all tell you that.

718
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,700
 I never told you that.

719
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,060
 I never said your life was over.

720
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,860
 I never said you were too old.

721
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,700
 That was Israel who said that to you.

722
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,540
 I never said that you were a failure.

723
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,080
 None of those words ever came from me.

724
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,160
 Here's what I'm saying to you.

725
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,660
 Pick up your horn because I'm not done with you yet.

726
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,620
 Because there's something you're about to do that will be a legacy for the whole of

727
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,020
 the human race.

728
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,200
 Grab your horn, he says.

729
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,020
 And here's what I want to say to some of you this morning.

730
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,660
 Pick up your horn.

731
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,500
 Pick up your horn.

732
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,700
 For Samuel, it was a literal horn.

733
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,700
 For you, it's not a literal horn.

734
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,300
 That would be weird.

735
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,820
 But the horn was a symbol for Samuel of what he had been called to do.

736
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,220
 What's that tool for you?

737
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,220
 What have you been called to do?

738
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,100
 For some of you, that's your work.

739
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
 That's your business.

740
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,220
 Grab a hold of it like never before.

741
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,060
 Some of you, that's the ability to pray.

742
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,140
 Pray like never before.

743
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,820
 Some of you, that's a gift or a talent to communicate.

744
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,100
 Pray like you've never done before.

745
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,020
 For some of you, it might be whatever it is.

746
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,420
 Whatever God has put on your heart, whatever talent or gift, whatever tool he has given

747
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,900
 you to be able to share the gospel, and he's given it to every single person, grab your

748
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,260
 horn.

749
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,820
 Don't allow shame, regret, failure, disappointment, and hurt define your future.

750
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,420
 He is not done with you yet.

751
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,420
 Come on, church.

752
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,660
 He's not done with you yet.

753
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,540
 There's so much more ahead for you.

754
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,740
 So much more ahead for me.

755
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,740
 I'm turning 50.

756
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,660
 Oh, I feel like he's done with me.

757
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,820
 I'm turning 50 in a month.

758
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,340
 Oh, Lord Jesus.

759
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,980
 Yeah.

760
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,300
 The eldest came to me the other day.

761
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,180
 "Andrew, you are very old," they said.

762
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
 Just kidding.

763
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,180
 The eldest didn't say that.

764
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,180
 He's not done with me yet.

765
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,180
 Honestly, I'm preaching to myself.

766
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,100
 I feel a bit emotional right now.

767
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,260
 I'm preaching to myself.

768
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,940
 He's not done with me yet.

769
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,940
 He's not done with you.

770
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,940
 How old you are in this room?

771
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,980
 50 is not old.

772
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,100
 There might be some older people here watching online.

773
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,100
 I see you, John.

774
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,740
 I love you.

775
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,180
 He's not done with you yet.

776
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,180
 Amen?

777
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,180
 Now, notice this.

778
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,980
 He says, sorry, I'm going to finish soon.

779
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,820
 He says here, he says, "Fill your horn with oil."

780
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,820
 I love this.

781
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,300
 He doesn't say, "Fill your horn with your own strength.

782
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,780
 Fill your horn with just your good news or your good works."

783
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,100
 He doesn't say, "Fill the horn with your talent."

784
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,740
 He said, "Fill it with my oil.

785
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,420
 Fill it with the oil of the Holy Spirit."

786
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,580
 It's only Jesus that brings our dead tools to life.

787
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,220
 It's only Jesus that takes those talents and uses them to do something in the kingdom.

788
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,140
 Remember, it's him who changes the world.

789
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,100
 We're just empty, broken vessels.

790
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,700
 But when the oil of the Holy Spirit comes on us, we are able to do like the disciples

791
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,020
 did in that upper room, things that they never thought they would ever be able to do.

792
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,220
 Think changes and transforms when you're filled with Jesus.

793
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,620
 Notice this.

794
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:55,460
 When sin happened in Genesis 3, all of humanity was brought into a place of brokenness and

795
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,140
 the whole of creation was.

796
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,900
 And the Bible describes it like this, that all of creation has been mourning.

797
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,540
 And Jesus is described to us through the Old Testament as the horn of our salvation.

798
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:15,340
 In other words, Jesus is the vessel that God decided to choose to pour out on humanity.

799
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:21,020
 The one who has decided to bring hope and freedom and life to broken, sinful humanity.

800
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,300
 Jesus is the horn of our salvation.

801
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,260
 And so if there's anyone that we come to, to receive the oil from, to receive the Spirit

802
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,980
 of God from, surely it's Christ.

803
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,980
 It has to be Christ.

804
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,980
 It's only Christ.

805
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,140
 He is the horn that God has provided that is poured out over you.

806
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,540
 So when he says, "Pick up your horn," he's like, "I've already picked up mine.

807
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:46,960
 My horn went to the cross for you, rose from the dead for you, forgives your sins for you.

808
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
 You are forgiven."

809
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,580
 That doesn't mean you're going to have this perfect, sunny, shiny life all the time, but

810
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,380
 it means that even in mourning, you are comforted.

811
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,380
 Amen?

812
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,860
 Even in the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure, that is not the end of your story.

813
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:04,660
 I am there with you and I will walk you into the new thing that I have for you.

814
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:09,980
 2025 will be your most significant year yet.

815
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,500
 Because he would say over to you, "I am not done with you.

816
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,660
 Do not allow the soul to stop you from the David.

817
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,940
 How long will you mourn?"

818
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:26,340
 I wonder whether you close your eyes with me and I want to just pray and we're going

819
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,340
 to make some space.

820
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,340
 We've got plenty of time.

821
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,980
 So we've designed the service today specifically to give us more time.

822
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,360
 And as your eyes are closed, I want to just explain in a moment, we're going to invite

823
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,420
 you to come forward for communion.

824
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,780
 Now just keep your eyes closed, but let me explain.

825
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,900
 In a moment, we're going to invite you to come forward for communion.

826
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,900
 Normally here at the Vine, we pass communion out to you and you receive it that way.

827
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,460
 But today we want you to be active.

828
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,700
 We want you to take action.

829
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,820
 Want you to be in the prophetic side of this word.

830
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,140
 And so we want you to come forward.

831
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,140
 So there's going to be four stations in the front here.

832
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,180
 There's two on either sides in the lower house as well.

833
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,860
 Upstairs is two at the front and two at the back.

834
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,740
 And in a moment, you'll be invited in your own time when you're ready to come and receive

835
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,040
 communion from one of our leaders or elders here.

836
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,780
 And we will bless you as you receive the communion.

837
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,580
 Then you can take it back and you can take communion in your chair with your friends,

838
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,940
 family, whoever you're here with, or if you're on your own, you can take it on your own.

839
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,780
 But before you come forward for communion, we want to give you space to receive what

840
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,340
 the Holy Spirit has for you.

841
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:42,620
 In some ways today, the communion is the coming forward after we felt like the Lord has ministered

842
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,620
 to us.

843
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,220
 And so we're going to create some space for you now to receive the ministry of the Holy

844
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,220
 Spirit.

845
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,500
 It's the most important part of our service.

846
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,140
 And I want to encourage that in a couple of ways.

847
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,220
 Maybe something I've shared today.

848
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,740
 Maybe you recognize that hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure has dominated your

849
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,540
 thinking too much.

850
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,800
 Maybe you recognize that you're holding onto a soul.

851
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,740
 Maybe you feel like you're not worthy of a David.

852
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:20,860
 And maybe you're entering 2025 locked and anchored and tethered into the past when the

853
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:28,820
 Lord says, "This is going to be your most significant year yet."

854
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:33,180
 But if you're anything like me, hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, failure, those are powerful

855
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,980
 things.

856
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:42,500
 And when the Lord said to Samuel, "Fill your home with oil," what he's basically saying

857
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,860
 to you is, "How long will you go before you invite my Holy Spirit into that part of your

858
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,860
 life?

859
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:56,420
 How long will you go until you invite my Spirit into the hurt, into the disappointment, into

860
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,860
 the regret and the shame and the failure?

861
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:06,700
 For I'm here and I will comfort those who mourn."

862
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,860
 Maybe for some of you, you've been carrying around those five things so much because you

863
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,340
 haven't had the courage to invite the Spirit in.

864
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,380
 Maybe it's been too painful to invite the Spirit in.

865
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:23,260
 I want to encourage you to be brave at the start of this year.

866
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,780
 And so in this ministry time before you come for communion, you can just take your time

867
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,620
 to invite Him into those areas.

868
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,100
 Ask Him to help you to let go of your soul.

869
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:41,740
 Ask Him to show you what He sees about your future, how much He loves you, how much He's

870
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:48,100
 prepared that's just ahead of you, how He doesn't want the hurt and the shame and the

871
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,740
 regret and failure to dominate your thinking and your vision.

872
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,820
 If you're here with family and friends and you want someone to pray for you, just invite

873
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,460
 them to pray for you in a moment.

874
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,060
 Just reach out and say, "Hey, would you pray for me?

875
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,860
 That's an important word for me today.

876
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,940
 I need to respond.

877
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,100
 Would you just help me and pray?"

878
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:13,100
 And so whilst we're all being ministered to and prayed for in your own time when you're

879
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:18,020
 ready, you can then come forward to receive communion as a way of culminating perhaps

880
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,500
 what it is that the Spirit of God is doing in you.

881
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,260
 We have about 15 minutes for this, so there's no need to rush.

882
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,760
 So Lord Jesus, I pray for each person here.

883
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,380
 If you'd like to receive this prayer, just open your hands as I pray.

884
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,060
 Holy Spirit, Father, we're grateful.

885
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,340
 We're grateful that we're standing on the precipice of 2025, the most significant year

886
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,260
 of our lives.

887
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,840
 We're thankful that you are a forward-moving God.

888
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:54,700
 But Father, we recognize that we carry hurt and disappointment, that regret and shame

889
00:46:54,700 --> 00:47:01,420
 and failure are part of our story and sometimes are too much a part of our story.

890
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,820
 Father, would you come?

891
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,460
 Would you minister to me right now in this place?

892
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:14,060
 Would you enable my spirit to say to you, "You are not done with me?

893
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,340
 Thank you, Lord, that you're not done with me.

894
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,700
 Thank you that I have not disqualified myself.

895
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:24,100
 Thank you, Lord, that I'm still on plan A. I may not have all the answers.

896
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,140
 I may still struggle with the trauma of what it is I've been going through, but Lord, thank

897
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:37,900
 you that you forgive, redeem, renew, restore, that this will be my most significant year."

898
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,900
 So I'm just going to invite the elders and pastors to come and just be at the stations

899
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,900
 now.

900
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,980
 But I want to invite you to take your time.

901
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,420
 Pray with the person next to you if you want to pray.

902
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,860
 Just receive more of the Holy Spirit if that's what you want.

903
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,060
 Weep if you want to weep.

904
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,180
 This is a safe place.

905
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:03,060
 And in a moment, when it's right, we'll respond together in worship.

906
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:09,180
 Amen.

907
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:19,060
 Amen.

908
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:29,060
