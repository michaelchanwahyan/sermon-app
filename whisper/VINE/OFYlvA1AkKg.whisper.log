[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Well, good morning again. How's everyone?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Now I get to be nice.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   I am nice. I'm a nice person.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   I hope you received that with the love and the grace that it was given to you guys.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   My favorite movie when I was a kid was the 1985 Steven Spielberg classic, "The Goonies".
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Anyone ever watch "The Goonies" before? Hands in the air.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Alright, you all qualify for the elderly community group here at The Vine.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   You'll get to meet with me later. I'm also a part of that group.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   "The Goonies" came out in 1985 and it literally changed cinema for anybody who grew up in the 80s.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   The reason why I think I love the film so much is because it was about a bunch of boys
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   who were relatively my age when the film came out.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   In fact, these boys right here. This is Chunk, that's Mikey, that's Mouth and Data on the other end.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And this film was fantastic.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   These four boys discover a treasure map in the attic of their house
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   and go on this grand adventure where they discover hidden treasure
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   and they fall against ancient curses. It was cinematic glory.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Now when the film first came out, I was far too young to go to the cinema to actually watch the film.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   But lo and behold, a few months later, TVB here in Hong Kong began to show "The Goonies"
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   as one of its movies on rotation.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   But the problem was it came on at 9 o'clock at night and I was still too young.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   My parents would not let me stay up late enough to watch the film.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   This was very frustrating.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   If you wanted to watch a film in those days and you were a kid and you weren't allowed to stay up,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   you would miss out on all of the cinematic glory that God wants you to have.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   You couldn't have it.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   All of that changed one day when my father came home from work
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   carrying a black box under his arms which he placed under the television.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   It looked like this.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I thought this was something out of space. It was so cool.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   This, apparently according to my dad, had the power to record anything on television
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   so you can watch it at a later time.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   My dad called it a VCR recorder. I called it God.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   This thing literally changed my childhood.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Suddenly all the things that I couldn't stay up late enough to watch,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   suddenly these were available to me at the fingertips, including the Goonies,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   which TVB, just a few months later after dad brought this home, actually aired again on television.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I said to my dad, "Would you please put a tape in the machine?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Would you set the recording time?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Would you capture the movie so I can come home the next day and watch it for the first time?"
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   So my dad got the tape out. He put it in. He set the recording up.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I cannot tell you how excited I was to come home from school that day.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I gathered all my mates from the neighborhood.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   We all got together. We had a little bit of popcorn.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   We put the tape in. We pushed play. And guess what?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It was the best movie I have ever seen in my life.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It was amazing. I'd never seen anything quite like it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   The kids were my age. I was just like, "This was worth waiting for."
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   My favorite scene, trust me, I wore that tape thin.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I watched it probably over a hundred different times.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   My favorite scene was the very opening scene.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   In the very opening scene of the movie, a black SUV meanders up a very quiet cul-de-sac of a small suburban neighborhood.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It drives past very slowly this beautiful house.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   The camera pans from the black SUV up to the house,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   and there's the main star of the film, Mikey, leaning on the window sill of his bedroom.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   He falls back on his bed and he says the opening words of the movie.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   He says, "Oh, bummer. Nothing ever exciting happens around here anyway."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It's really ironic because he's about to discover a treasure map in his attic
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and go on this incredible journey that will change his life,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   but he knows nothing about that in that moment.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   So those opening words from the opening scene is this ironic statement about all that happens,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and I thought Steven Spielberg is the greatest director and storyteller ever.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Well, many years later, I'm at university, and I'm living in a house with a bunch of guys,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and one night we're bored, and so we said to each other, "What should we do?"
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And I said, "I know. Let's rent the Goonies."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And we had all watched The Goonies in our youth, but now it was years later,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   and we wanted to watch it again. We were so excited.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Now, at that time, it was on the futuristic technology of DVDs,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   so we rented the DVD of The Goonies.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   By the way, if you've not watched this film, your homework this week is to watch The Goonies.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   So we get the DVD, we put it in our little DVD player, we put it in, we push play.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   You will never guess what happened.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   The film had a beginning that I had never seen.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   In fact, the film had five minutes in the beginning that I had never seen before.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I could not believe it, and it suddenly dawned on me
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   that my dad must have set the VCR recorder five minutes later than the beginning of the film.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And so I had missed out on the first five minutes of the greatest film ever made.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And let me tell you, that's not just any five minutes.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It is the greatest five minutes in cinematic history,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   because the opening of the film of The Goonies is created and designed by Spielberg
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   to set up everything that comes next.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I mean, it's crazy what happens in the first five minutes that I had missed.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   There's a fake suicide in a jail cell. There's a breaking out of jail.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   There's a setting fire to the perimeter of the jail.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And then the criminal dives into the back of a vehicle, and guess what that vehicle is?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   A black SUV, right?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   He dives into the back of this black SUV, and then they start to break out of jail.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   The whole police in this little town in Washington in the US are trying to chase after them.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And they have this massive car chase all the way through the city.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And whilst the car is being chased by all the police,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   it introduces us to the main characters of the film.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And by the way that it speeds in and out of all of the town, it destroys so many things.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It eventually ends up, the black SUV on a beach, and it's trying to get on this beach,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   and all the police are there, and eventually they manage to get around all of that,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and then they take a left-hand turn, and they go into a small, quiet, suburban neighborhood.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And they drift up the road and turn right, and the camera pans up, and there's Mikey.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   And he falls back on his bed, and he says the opening words of the movie.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   "Ah, bummer. I wish I'd seen the first five minutes originally. No."
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   He said, "Ah, bummer. Nothing ever exciting happens here anyway."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And what I thought were ironic words about what was ahead
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   were actually ironic words about what had already happened.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And the depth of those words.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I mean, when he's leaning out on that windowsill, and he's looking down on that black SUV,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   the people in that black SUV are the very ones who are about to change his life forever.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And Spielberg is a master storyteller, and he weaves all of this together.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And I had missed every single bit of it.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And when I finally watched the film from the original beginning,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   the way that the storyteller wanted me to understand it,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   it completely changed how I appreciated that movie even more.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   You see, the good stories, the really good stories,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   always have an intentional purpose to their beginnings.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And the storyteller, as they're trying to unpack these stories for you,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   begin in a way to shape and form a lens through which they want you to view the rest of the story.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Which means when we get the beginning wrong,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   when we start the story, if you will, from the wrong place,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   chances are everything else in that story is going to be distorted from its original intended meaning.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   You have to view the story through the original lens that the storyteller wants you to approach it.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And that whole process is never more important than the story we're looking at today,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   the story of the plagues.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   The plagues are perhaps the most central element that happens in all of the Exodus story.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But they are also the most controversial elements of that story.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   In the plagues, which are captured for us from chapter 7 through to chapter 12,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   we see an event after event of God's awesome power on the earth,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   of God's judgment on the earth.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And in that judgment and in that power,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   we see the way in which God uses various things and does various things to express his judgment.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And we see in that things that we're not comfortable with.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And we wrestle with these deep questions of how can a loving God be so violent,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   do things like that bring that kind of judgment?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I thought God was peaceful and loving and good.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   How would he and why would he do this?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And if you just grab the Bible and you start in chapter 7 of Exodus,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   you start reading the plagues, you're going to be weighed down by those questions.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Because you're not actually starting in the place that the storyteller wants you to start.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   You see, there's some very specific beginnings,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   intended purposes that God has created and put in the story of Scripture up to the point of the plagues
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   that unless you see it through there, you're going to actually struggle deeply with the narrative.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Starting in the right place with the plagues is essential for you to understand what they're really trying to say and do.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Now, it doesn't necessarily suddenly magically wipe away some of those big, deep theological questions
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   of the violent nature of God in the Old Testament.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Those things linger and remain.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   But seeing it through the right lens enables us to get an understanding of what God's really trying to communicate about himself,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   about the world, and most importantly, about you.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   About you and your story, you and your Exodus,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   you and the very thing that you long to depart from.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And so as we open up the story of the plagues today,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   I want to open up to you that story through its real beginning.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   That beginning is found in three places.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Two in the book of Genesis and one actually in the book of Exodus itself.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   In the book of Genesis, we see right at the beginning of all things God's creation of the world.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And God's creation of the world in Genesis 1 and 2 is a primary lens through which the storyteller,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   God and Moses in writing it down, is trying to help you to understand as you go through the plagues.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   What you see in the creation, and I've been saying this over so many weeks of this series,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   everything that happens in Genesis 1, 2, and 3 is very much what Moses is drawing into his writing of the Exodus.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   The language, the imagery, the way he communicates,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   so much of it pulls from what he had already written in Genesis 1, 2, and 3.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Now in Genesis 1 and 2, we see some critical things about how God creates.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Let me show you these things.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Light and darkness are separated.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Creatures of the sea and land are separated.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   When we come to creation in the Bible, what we're seeing is God saying,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   "I'm in power and control on creation, and when I create, I put things in their right order.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   There's an order to the universe, and I separate things so that they would be in their right place and in their right order."
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   The pinnacle of this, of course, is the creation of humanity,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   formed out of the dust itself and breathed on by God's breath and brought into life.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And that humanity then is given the task to multiply and fill the earth.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   It's like God is saying, "I have ordered creation in a way.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   The pinnacle of that creation is humanity, and I want humanity to be a blessing to my creation."
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And humanity is to multiply and fill the earth and bless and steward the creation that I've given them,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   which is why the final point here, harmony is secure between humanity, God, and creation,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   because that harmony is God's intent and purpose.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   What you see at the end of Genesis 1 and 2 is God standing back and saying, "This is very good.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Everything is ordered how I wanted it to be, and I've created humanity so that it can walk with me in bringing harmony and peace,"
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   the biblical word shalom, "to the world that I've created."
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And by the time you get to the end of Genesis 1 and 2, it's like there's a breathing out sigh that everything is just as it should be.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Make sense? That's your first lens.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Here's the second lens, the creation of Israel.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   This is found in Genesis 12.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Let me actually read you verses 2 and 3.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   "I will make you"—this is God speaking to Abram—"I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I will bless those who bless you. Whoever curses you, I will curse, and all the people on earth will be blessed through you."
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   This is God speaking out over Abram at the starting point of Israel as a nation.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   And I want you to see the critical thing here.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   God is focused on blessing.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   He's like, "I'm going to bless you. I'm going to make your name great.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And I'm going to form and shape you in such a way that you're going to be my blessing in the world."
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   In other words, the harmony that is found in Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   and the way in which God creates that harmony, that is going to be seen best through how a nation works together.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   A little bit like how I stood before you a moment ago and said,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   "Here are some cultural things about our community that are important for the world to see the nature of God."
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   God creates Israel as a community to represent His nature to the world.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   "I'll bless you, and you'll be a blessing."
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   But notice, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you, I will curse."
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Very important you understand this.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   What God's saying is, "Out of this nation of Israel, I am going to form and shape them the way that harmony in the world should be,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   the way that my purposes and my promises should be."
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   So those that bless you as a nation are aligning themselves to my purposes and promises,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   but those that curse you as a nation are standing against my purposes and promises.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   So the reason why I judge the nations of the world when I judge them,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   is because they have moved themselves and standing against the purposes and promises I have.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   How you treat my people will be a representation of what's in your heart.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Now that's a very important lens for us to look through as we get to the plagues.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   But notice one other thing here. It says, "All the people on earth will be blessed through you."
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   This is so key, because even in the moment of the creation of Israel,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   where God talks about blessings and curses, relationship, and how there is judgment
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   if things are not aligned to his purposes and promises,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   he then immediately provides grace.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   He says, "All the people of the world will be blessed through this nation, even the ones who curse the nation.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   If they curse my people, they will be cursed, but cursings can be turned into blessings with God."
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Cursings can be turned into blessings with God.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   And so all the people in all the nations, everybody, will ultimately be blessed.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Now we know in the story that's through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   But here in Genesis, the idea is that through Israel will come this blessing to all nations,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   and God has provided both judgment and grace.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Does that make sense to you? Anyone?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Here's the third lens that the author wants you to look through before you get there.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   It's the prologue to the plagues themselves in the book of Exodus.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   It's actually found, we read it last week, in Exodus 7.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Let me read you verse 3.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   This is how God declares the plagues.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   He calls them, "My miraculous signs and wonders."
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I love this. Very important you get this.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   God actually declares that the plagues, when he describes them at the very start to Moses and Aaron,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   he's like, "I'm about to do all these plagues, but they are," you need to understand this,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   "signs and wonders."
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   That's how he describes them. They're signs and they're wonders.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And this idea of signs and wonders is a very important thread throughout the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   A sign was always something that happens that imparted some kind of knowledge about God.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   A wonder was always a supernatural event that was designed to disrupt the ordinary
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   in order to bring a message from God.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   So a sign imparted some kind of knowledge.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   A wonder was a shaking up. We sung it in that song.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   "Shake up the ground of my tradition. Shake up the ground of my religion."
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   That was what wonders were given for.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   To shake up the ground so that we might come into a re-understanding of the character and the nature of God.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Do you see that?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   So when God himself talks about the plagues and lays them up as signs and wonders,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   what he's essentially doing is, "There's something you can learn about me in these plagues,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   and these plagues are to disrupt the ordinary so that something fresh and new,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   a new message of my heart will be understood."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Now, here's the final thing with the signs and wonders.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Signs and wonders were usually brought through prophets to the kings.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   You'll see this later on in the Old Testament narrative once Israel settles itself into the promised land.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And signs and wonders were the tools of the prophets
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   in order to get kings to change their ways, otherwise judgment will come.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   So the plagues, yes, they are acts of judgment.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   But they are also signs and wonders provided by God to offer grace to his people and to Egypt
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   to turn from their ways before the true final judgment comes.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   The plagues are actually God's way of saying, "Will you listen? Will you see?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Will you understand the story behind the story, or will you begin the movie five minutes in?"
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Now, the way that Egypt had set up their film is they didn't want the movie of Yahweh at all.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   For them, they had come up with their own system of understanding, harmony in the world.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And what we see in Genesis 3 is really important because we see this in the nature of Egypt at that time.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Genesis 3, Satan comes to Adam and Eve and says, "You can take this fruit and you can eat it.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And in doing so, you'll discover that there's other ways of thinking about the world
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   than the way that God has created you to think about it."
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And Adam and Eve are tempted to take that fruit because they believe that God is holding out on them,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   that there is an alternative way of worship.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And what you see, fast forward in all the years when you get to Egypt,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   is that Egypt is living out an empire of an alternative way of worshiping.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   They have a pantheon of gods that they have constructed in order to keep control over the workings of humanity.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And that pantheon of gods has created an environment where absolutely everything in Egypt's society
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   was all down to the worship of various different idols in order to retain harmony in the world.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Very interestingly, harmony becomes a central part to Egyptian religious belief.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   So when God shows up with the plagues, he's actually trying to subvert this alternative idea of worship
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   and bring his people back to the way things had always intended to be.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   And he does that through some pretty dramatic things.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And to help you to understand and see all of that, let me take you once again to the land of Egypt.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   The one central driving force of ancient Egyptian life was religion.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   The Egyptians believed in a pantheon of gods, which were involved in all aspects of nature and human society.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   The gods quite literally were everywhere.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And in order to have a successful life for yourself and for your family,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   you needed to expertly navigate a complex system of beliefs and rituals,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   using prayer and offerings to interact with the various gods in control of the world around you.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   All of which meant ensuring a prosperous life for yourself and those around you.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Well, it was actually really exhausting.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   I mean, could you imagine being surrounded every day by these deities and these gods
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   constantly reminding yourself of your need to be in harmonious relationship with them?
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And it's this concept of harmony that was actually central to ancient Egyptian religion.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   See, core to their beliefs was a concept known as Ma'at.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   This was a cosmic eternal order, a little bit similar to our modern day concepts of truth and justice,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   but found in the cosmos as well as human society.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And ancient Egyptians believed that their sole purpose was actually to maintain Ma'at in the universe.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And they did this through their relationship with the gods, by their various offerings, their daily rituals,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   all of which were designed to starve off disorder and ensure harmony remained.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   And here is what is key in all of that.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Any threat to the cosmic order was not just a threat to the person themselves, but a threat to the whole universe.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And a threat like that needed to be dealt with in one of two ways,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   either aggressively suppressed or ideally completely wiped out.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   So imagine what it would have been like if you were a Jewish slave in the land at that time.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   I mean, you would have been raised to believe that there was only one God in the universe, Yahweh,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   who could hold all of Ma'at in his hands.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   And yet every single day you would have constantly been reminded that actually that is a stupid idea,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   that instead thousands of gods are needed to maintain harmony in the universe.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And in this way, Egypt's slavery of God's people was actually more than just a physical oppression.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   It was a spiritual oppression as well.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Everything Egypt could do was designed to mock the one central question of the whole of the Jewish faith.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Could it really be that one God is able to hold the whole universe in power at one time?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Well, that question and the freedom the answer brings is what the plagues are all about.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And to understand that, I need to take us now back to the waters of the Nile.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   If maintaining Ma'at in the universe was the primary aim of Egyptian religion,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   no single source of such harmony was more powerfully symbolized than by the life-giving power of the Nile River.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   The Nile was everything for ancient Egyptians,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   a source of human life through its fish for eating and its waters for drinking,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   and in its annual flooding a source of cosmic life to all nature around it.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   The Nile was Egypt's strongest demonstration of the balance and order that existed between the gods and people.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   If its waters remained healthy, so would its people.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   It should not surprise us then that this is the very first place God calls Moses and Aaron to come
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   in order to display his cosmic power.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   See, God tells Moses to instruct Aaron to stretch out his hand and staff,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   touch the water, and turn it into blood,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   thereby killing all of the fish and creating such a stench
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   that people won't come to drink from here from that point forward.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And we have to see the story behind the story here.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   You see, God's first act of convincing Pharaoh to let the Israelites go
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   is designed to strike at the very heart of Egyptian religious belief.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   God disrupts the Ma'at of the universe in order to demonstrate that the only Ma'at is found in him.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   The rest of the plagues follow suit.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Each one is a specific statement from Yahweh that he is far more powerful than any of the many gods of Egypt.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   So the plague of frogs is a demonstration against Heket, the frog goddess of fertility.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   The flies against Kepri, the fly god of Egypt.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   The plague of hell against Nut, the god of the atmosphere.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   The darkness against Ra, the Egyptian god of the sun.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And with each plague comes a consistent message.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   This one single god, Yahweh, is the one and only true God,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   and all other pretenses the deity must bow down.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   It would be this constant display of God's power over and above the power of the gods of Egypt
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   that would eventually soften Pharaoh's heart and bring him to his decision to finally let the Israelites go.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And we see in this process and God's involvement in it,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   something very important for all of our journeys in Exodus.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   You see, God understands that in order to break the chains of our physical oppression,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   we have to first of all break the chains of our spiritual oppression.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   We have to know that there is a God who's got greater power than anything in the universe,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   and through that find faith rising up in us to stand against anything that attempts to chain us.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   See, God reveals his true power to Israel and their journey in freedom begins.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   May it also be so for you.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   I want to help you to see that journey of freedom for you by mapping out very briefly the plagues.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   There are 10 of them in total.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   The 10th one is the one that's perhaps the most shocking,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   the one that's perhaps the most difficult to deal with,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   and that's the one that we'll deal with next week, thankfully.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And that's all on the Passover and what God does there.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   But the other nine plagues that we see are actually broken into three different cycles.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Let me show you a diagram.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   I know I told you earlier to put your phones away,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   but you can get them out for just a brief term and take a photo of this slide if you would like,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   because this is a very helpful—I'll get out of your way a little bit—
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   but this is a very helpful slide if you want to study a little bit more around the cycles of the plagues.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   So as I mentioned earlier, they're found from chapter 7 through to chapter 12.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   What you'll see here is that there are three separate cycles of in total nine plagues.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   There are the Scriptures they have,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   particularly the Egyptian gods that each of those plagues are against and bringing a polemic against are there,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   but also, very importantly, God's intention about what he's trying to communicate about himself in each of those cycles.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And I'll explain that a little bit more in a moment.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   But I want you to see something, first of all.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   One of the things that God is doing through the lens that we looked at with the creation of the world in Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   his judgment against what Egypt are doing through their pantheon of gods
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   is a judgment which basically results in his de-creation of the world.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   So actually, and this is fascinating, all of the plagues are a de-creation event
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   that mirrors a creative event that happened in Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   because what God is trying to do is basically say, "I need to de-create in order to then free Israel to create again Israel in the way that they'll be going forward."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   So all of these are de-creative events.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Let me give you an example. The frogs.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Remember I said that there was a separation between the earth, the land, or sorry, the sea and the land.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   There's a separation between those two things.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Well, with the plague of frogs, frogs are the ones that have the ability to go on both land and in both water.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And God brings a plague of frogs to cover the earth between the waters and the ground
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   in order to de-construct what he had done in Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Likewise, the gnats. We're told that in the gnats plague, God takes dust and he creates the gnats out of the dust.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   In the same way that he had taken dust in Genesis 1 and 2 and created humanity,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   now he creates gnats to show the chaos that comes when you try to do things in a different way.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   These all follow suit. The flies, for example.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Actually, when Moses writes about the plague of flies, he says they multiply and fill the earth.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   The same language he uses about God's call on humanity in Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Again, God is de-creating in order to futurely create.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   The plague of darkness on cycle 3.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Again, God had separated light and darkness.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Now in the plagues, God brings darkness in the middle of the day to once again de-construct
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   in order to say, "I'm going to do things differently."
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   And his main communication is, "If you have any other form of worship,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   any other way of thinking about harmony, it is not true.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   It will only bring more chaos, and I show you that chaos in judgment of the other form of worship that you have."
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Notice, though, on the right side here, God's intervention.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Remember that God describes his plagues as signs and wonders.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   In each cycle of plagues, God is actually saying something about himself to Egypt and to Israel.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   In the first cycle, he says, "By this you shall know that I am the Lord."
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   In other words, I'm inviting you into this intimate, personal relationship with me,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   and you would know that I am a true God, the one and only true God.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And I do these things in order to shake up, remember, disrupt your ordinary
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   to bring you into a knowledge that I am the one true God.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   In cycle two, he says, "That you may know that I am the Lord, and I am in the midst of the land."
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   This is really important, because Yahweh is basically saying,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   "I'm not some god, the pantheon of the Egyptian gods where deities removed."
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   God is saying, "I'm in the land itself. I'm here with you.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   I'm not distant. I'm not on some fluffy cloud trying to manipulate the world in some way.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I'm actually present and with you. I am a God who is in the land itself."
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   And that differentiates himself from all of the pantheon of Egyptian gods.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   And then in cycle three, he says, "So that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth."
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   No other God. Everything else is a pretense to authority.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   The only authority is me. You would know through this that I am the only God,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   that none of your magicians can create any of the plagues in the way that I can.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   I am the one true, powerful God, and all other pretenses to authority must bow down.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   The lens through which we approach the plagues enables us to see that God is actually offering to Egypt
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   the fullness of who he is. You don't need those hundreds of gods.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   You don't need to live in a stressed way where you're trying to please everything around you.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   You just need me. And I'm not just distant, but I'm present.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   I'm in the land. And everything else submits to me.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   I'm the one who holds all my ite in my hands.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   And you can find escape from the pressures of trying to chase everything else with just your worship of me.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And some of you in this room, that's a word for you.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Because God is saying the same thing to you today through the plague narrative.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   You don't need all this other stuff. All these other little ways in which you worship.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   All these other little idols that you're bowing down to.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   All this other stuff of culture that you think you need to fit into in order to succeed.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   The only thing you need for true power, for true authority, true harmony, true peace is me.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   And for some of you, that's a call of God on you today.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   So through the plagues and all of this, what is it that the people learn?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Well, here's what Egypt learns.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   They learn that there is one God who can hold all my ite in his hands.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   And they better bow down to that one God. Otherwise, things won't go well for them.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Pharaoh, his heart is hardened and he hardens his heart with everything.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   His pride gets in the way. And eventually, as we'll see next week,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   he finally lets Israel go through the work of the Passover and the death of the firstborn sons of Egypt.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   But all of that process is building the pressure on Egypt to see that there is only one true God
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   that holds my ite in all his hands.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   But every single plague, there's an opportunity for them to turn.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Every single plague, there's an opportunity for them to respond to this God
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   and give their lives and their authority and their worship to him.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Israel also learns a lot.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   They learn that after having spent so many years in Egypt,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   they had naturally begun to worship some of those deities of Egypt.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   I mean, can you imagine, like I said in the film, being surrounded by all those gods all the time?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Well, you would have felt that pressure to align yourself to the culture of your time.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   And the plagues is a wonder to them.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   It's a thing that disrupts their ordinary and helps them to realize,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   "Hang on a sec, what are we doing? Why are we worshiping all these other gods
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   when there is only one God, the God of our forefather, of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   That's the God we should worship."
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And the plagues actually work for Israel as a shaking up of their ground
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   so that they can remember the true God that they were always called to worship.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   But the plagues also do something else for Israel.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   They enable them to realize that Moses and Aaron are actually not false prophets.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Remember what happened in Exodus chapter 5.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Moses and Aaron had gone before Pharaoh and said, "Let my people go."
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   And Pharaoh had gone, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   It makes their slavery even worse.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And up until this point, all of Israel thinks Moses and Aaron are false prophets.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   They don't really speak on behalf of Yahweh.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   The plagues demonstrate to all the Israelites
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   that Moses and Aaron are actually speaking on the mouthpiece of God,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   that they are true representatives of Yahweh, and that they should follow them.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   So the plagues actually work as a uniting movement for Israel
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   around the leadership of Moses and Aaron,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   something that is critical for everything that's going to happen next in the story.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   But what about for Moses?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   What does Moses learn?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Moses learns that despite the fact that he has been raised as a prince of Egypt,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   and despite the fact that he would have been incredibly talented
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   in knowing how to worship the variety of gods in Egypt,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and despite the fact that he'd had 40 years in the wilderness,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   he was still carrying some of the residue of that identity.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And the plagues was God's disruptive way to once and for all say to Moses,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   "You have to let that stuff go."
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   See, one of the things that Moses discovers is, I think,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   a central story of the whole of the Exodus journey, and it's this,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   that the call to let my people go was not just a call to Egypt
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   about releasing God's people from their slavery.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   It was actually a call to Israel about releasing themselves from their idolatry.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Come on, church.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   This is actually what the plagues are about for Israel.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   God is saying, "There are idols that you're holding in your hearts,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   and I'm demonstrating to you that I'm only the one true God,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   and you getting out of Egypt is only half the battle.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   The other part of the battle is you letting go of Egypt,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   you letting go of the idolatry that you have become accustomed to,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   because I just want you."
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And Moses sees in the plagues the disgusting reality of the idolatry of his people.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   And in that, a longing is birthed within Israel
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   to have a pure relationship with God again.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   And all of that is critical for them to move into the wilderness
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   and meet with God at Mount Sinai.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   But as I close, everybody's favorite words in a sermon,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   what is it that you learn through all of this?
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   What is it that you can take away and reflect around?
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   What is it that changes in your life because of the plagues?
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Well, first of all, I think the plagues help us to understand
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   that despite how it might look at times,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   God is at work behind the scenes in the corridors of power in this world.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   That God is the one who's ultimately in control.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   He is the one who ultimately has the authority on heaven and on earth.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And sometimes it's easy for us to look at the way things are
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   in terms of the power structures of this world.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   It's easier for us to look at the ones who govern us or lead us
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   and think that there's no way that anything good could ever come of that.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And what the plague narrative reminds us is that ultimately,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   God is in control of everything that happens in the world.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And that God brings signs and wonders at times
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   to bring his world back into relationship with him.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   And that should encourage us.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   We should see the plagues and have faith rise in us
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   that God will always hold governments to account
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   for how they govern their people.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   That God will always work towards justice in this world.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   And as his people, we get the opportunity to lean into that with our prayers,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   lean into that with our trust, lean into that and say,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   "Even though I don't see how this election is going to happen
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   or how this is going to work or how this is going to happen
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   or how this injustice is going to change,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I believe that God is not blind to it.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   I believe that God cares about it.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   I believe that God is involved in it and he's doing stuff
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   that I don't even understand, I don't even see.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   And my role is just to come alongside, to pray, to believe, to stand, to speak,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   to be his voice and his mouthpiece because he's a God of justice and he's at work."
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   And the cool should be on the church to rise up
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   and say that we believe that God is at work,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   even when it feels like the opposite.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   The second thing I think you can take away is the knowledge
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   that God is at war against the idols that are in your life.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   God is at war against anything that will take your heart away from him,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   anything that will distract you and hold you hostile
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   to God's good purposes in your life.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   God has an unrelenting passion to see freedom come for his people.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   And I want you to hear this.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   God is not just interested in your freedom.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   He also wants your heart.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   And for God, if he doesn't get your whole heart,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   then you will never truly be free.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   See, the purpose of the Exodus is not to get you out of some bad stuff
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   that's happened to you in the past.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   It's not just about freeing you from some chains that are around you.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   The point of the Exodus and the point brought to us through the power of the plagues
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   is that God doesn't want to just draw you out.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   He wants to draw you in.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   He wants to engage with you, be in relationship with you, know you more.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   He wants your heart not split between all these different things.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   He wants your whole heart, because it's only in your wholehearted devotion of him,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   your wholehearted worship of him, that you'll ever find yourself truly free
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   and therefore find yourself in harmony, in shalom,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   with the way that you've always been created to be.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   God is passionate not just about your freedom, but about where your heart is.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   And any time that our hearts are connected to idols, we're not truly free.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Which is the third and final thing I think you should take away with you.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   And this should encourage you deeply.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   God stands powerfully against every demonic force in this world.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   If there's anything you take away from today,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   may it be that whatever strategy that the enemy has over you,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   your family, your marriage, you yourself, whatever it might be,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   God is at work right here, right now,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   fighting against the demonic forces of this world.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   And that's ultimately seen, of course, in the life, death, and the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   It's ultimately seen in the blood that is shed in Jesus,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   which we're going to talk about next week, and you're going to see the power in that.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   But before we get to next week, know in this moment,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   that God stands against every demonic realm and every demonic force,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   and he stands against it, and he says, "Let my people go."
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   And I wonder whether you could hear the resonance of God's voice
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   over you and over your life, where he stands against any principality,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   and any darkness that's trying to have any influence over you, your kids, your family,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   whatever it might be, and he's standing and he's saying to those things,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   "Let this person go. Let this one go, because this one is my child."
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   And God has an unrelenting, unbridled fury of love for you and your freedom.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   And he will bring that against any pretense to authority and power
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   with such fury, a fury passioned by love, not by wrath, but by love,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   to stand with you and say, "I will do these things for you, over you,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   where you're not even realizing it, whilst you sleep, and behind the scenes,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   because I want you free, and there is no weapon formed against you that will prosper."
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   The plagues are God's way of saying to his people,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   "There is no weapon formed against you that will prosper."
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   And if there's anything you take from today,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   may it be a sense of the fighting power of God on your behalf.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And I want you to feel it. I want you to see it.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   The plagues are not nice. They're not easy. They raise big questions.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   They're a fireball of the fury of God's love for his creation.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   A fireball that stands against any other pretense to worship,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   any other system that would say there's another way,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   any other Satan that speaks to Adam and Eve and says,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   "Take this fruit, because this is better."
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   God's plagues are a picture to us of this unrelenting fire that God has
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   to say, "The way that I have created, the way that I am, is the only way to true peace for you."
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   And he wants you to know him that way,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   to know that you're protected, fought for, redeemed, saved, and set free.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   And that passion, I want you to feel now.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   To help you with that, take a look at this.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Let my people go.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   These wild, wild fires,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   raving and burning, consuming, hardened by the fury of heaven.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Stars become snakes, snakes become slaves,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   dressed in the chains of tomorrow's grave.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   The power of fear, blood in the water,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   the stench of injustice now torn from another.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Skies become flies, flies become hail, hammering the hardened with the holiest of nails.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   A stretching of hands, a rage from the heavens.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Darkness descended, darkness descended.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Now blood on the doorpost, an angel of death.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   The horror of genocide not far from our lips.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   A heaven of fury, burning and breaking.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   The hardened consumed with words still shaking.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Let my people go.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   That's how he feels for you.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   I wonder whether you'd just open your hands.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   You are loved, accepted, fought for.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   God has sent his son to the cross,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   to stand in the place where you should have stood.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   And with the fury of love, cast sin upon him,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   so you would know true life.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   You now stand more than a conqueror.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   And whatever idol or idols that are present in your heart,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   the forgiveness and the mercy of God is like what we just witnessed.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   It can be uncomfortable at times.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   And I know firsthand that God has sent me signs and wonders
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   to bring me to repentance.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And God brings his justice.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   And I pray that you would, through this understanding of the plagues today,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   leave this place knowing the price that has been paid,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   but also the power that there is that stands alongside of you.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   That the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is now in you.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   That same power, that same love, that same authority, it's in you.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And although the plagues are uncomfortable,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   and they raise lots of questions that we have to wrestle with,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   ultimately, seeing through the lens that the storyteller provides for us,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   they are an invitation to less of our idols and more of God.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   And I pray, in this moment and in the moments ahead for you this week,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   that you would continue to make that exchange
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   by simply coming before him
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   and saying the one powerful prayer in scripture that the whole Bible ends with.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   It's "Maranatha". It means "Come, Lord Jesus".
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   And Father, I pray for anyone here who needs to lay down idols,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   you would show them how to do that.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   And I pray every person here would invite more of you into their lives.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Come, Lord Jesus. Come.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Come, Lord Jesus. Come.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And we thank you for this. In Jesus' name.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Amen.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   We love you.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
