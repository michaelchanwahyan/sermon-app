[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Please have a seat.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   And we continue the long night of Christmas Eve with the proclamation story.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   The light that was brought into the world, it changed everything.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   It illuminated not only the darkness of the world, but also the darkness in us.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   It saw that the dark despair in all of God's people was now illuminated to God.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And God heard our wailing cry.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   God's light recognized the struggles, the hurt, the brokenness that we all carry
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   and reached out a tender hand of grace towards us.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   The birth of Jesus was a light to the blackest of evil and the darkest of sin.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   It was a new hope to all of us and needed therefore to be proclaimed to all the world.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And that proclamation happened just like this.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Luke chapter 2 verse 8 to 20.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   In that region there were shepherds living in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid, for see, I am bringing good news of great joy for all the people.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   To you is born in this day in the city of David a Savior who is the Messiah, the Lord.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   This will be a sign for you. You will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger."
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those who may favors."
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   When the angels left them and went up to heaven, the shepherds said to one another,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   "Let us now go to Bethlehem and see the thing that has taken place which the Lord has made known to us."
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So they went with haste, and they found Mary and Joseph and a child lying in the manger.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about the child,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen as it had been told them."
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I wonder if you could imagine what it would have been like to be one of the shepherds in the fields that night,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   the very original Christmas Eve.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Those shepherds were just going about their normal business, their normal day job.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   They were looking after sheep in the fields.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   They did that day in and day out. That's just what they did.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   In fact, they had to do it for months on end before the sheep were ready to be taken to likely the temple in Jerusalem.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   You have to remember Bethlehem is just six miles south of Jerusalem.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It's likely that the sheep that the shepherds were tending were destined for the sacrifice in the temple itself.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And so for months they'd been looking after these sheep because these sheep were their livelihood.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   These sheep were the reason why they could provide for their families.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   They looked after them until the time that they could sell them to the temple for the sacrifice that would take place there.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And then on this long night, suddenly something changes for them.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Imagine what it would be like for you if you were in your place of work.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   So think about you. If you're a teacher here, think about the classroom.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   If you're a CEO, think about the boardroom.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   If you're a pastor, think about church.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Whatever it is that you do, think about being in that context, your normal place of work, and then the angels show up.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   They have the audacity to break into your work meeting and go, "I'm here and I'm about to change the world."
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   A little bit inconvenient, perhaps.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   The Bible tells us that the shepherds were terrified, so overwhelmed.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I mean, that seems a normal response to a chorus of angels around you.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And the angels say this peculiar thing.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   "You don't need to be afraid because in Bethlehem, the town of David, a son has been born to you."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   A light, in other words, has come into the darkness.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And the angels challenged the shepherds to leave behind their flocks and travel to Bethlehem and visit with the born Messiah.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Now, that wasn't an easy decision.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I mean, think about it for a sec from their perspective.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   They had spent months tending these sheep that were essentially their livelihood.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And they knew day in, day out, they needed to be with them. Otherwise, the sheep had a tendency of wandering off.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And here's an angel basically saying, "OK, leave behind all your livelihood. Go into Bethlehem."
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And that might take, what, 10 hours, 12 hours, maybe over 24 hours to go there, see the child come back.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   By the time you get back, the sheep are likely gone, your livelihood over.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   If I had been one of the shepherds, I would have got my buddies together and said,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   "OK, we're going to create a union here. Two of us are going to stay with the sheep, whilst the rest of us go into Bethlehem.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   We're going to see if the angels are speaking the truth. If they are, we'll come back and let you know. Got it?"
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   But that's not what happened.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   These shepherds decided to get together, and they decided that they would leave their livelihood.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   They would sacrifice what was going to be sacrificed.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   That they were willing to give up all of that and what it represented, the provision that it represented,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   to obediently go and see if the Messiah had truly come.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And I've often wondered, why did the angels ask the shepherds to do that?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And I think it's for a simple reason. A reason that is also important for us in our Christmas Eve here in 2022.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   You see, what the angel was trying to describe and try to challenge the shepherds to do was to say this.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   "The Messiah has come. Now everything changes.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   The Messiah has come, and now your life has a new purpose and a new focus.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Before the Messiah was here, your life was consumed with your livelihood.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Your life was consumed with the good things of working hard and providing for yourself.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   All those are valuable things, but the Messiah has now come, and you've now been given a new mission.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And in the future now," the angels are saying, "not only will you have a livelihood, but you'll also have a proclamation.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Not only will you have something to look after, you'll also now have a story to tell.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   You're now going to be equipped to be the very first people who will take the light of the Messiah into the darkness of the world.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   The livelihood will remain, but there's now a new focus, a new mission."
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   The Scriptures tell us that those shepherds go and see the light of Christ, and they return,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   and they share with everybody the amazement in their hearts that actually God had turned up.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   God had put on eyebrows, a saliva gland, and a spleen, and moved into their neighborhood.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And that was a story worth telling.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   So the proclamation of Jesus, the light of Christ in the world, was not just a significant moment for the shepherds,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   but a significant moment for you and me too.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Because it was also an invitation for us to not make our own livelihoods the sum total of everything that happens in our lives,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   but also to realize that we are people on a mission.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   To realize that we also have a light to shine in the world.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   To realize that we need to be in the marketplace, we need to be in our places of livelihood,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   but shining forth the hope of Jesus in those places.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   That now we've got a story to tell that desperately is needed to be heard in Hong Kong.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   That we might realize that in our long night, as we wait, not for the original birth of Jesus,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   but for the second coming of Christ to the world, we have a story that makes sense of the darkness that still seems to be around us.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   A story that brings hope and life to those that don't see it.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Could you imagine what would happen to us if we would take the light of Christ into our city?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   For there is much need today for the light of Christ to be in the darkness of Hong Kong.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   This is all about for us, the arrival of Jesus for all people.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   A light on a hill that cannot anymore be hidden.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And so we are now challenged to consider for ourselves,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   are we willing to hold that light out courageously and hopefully to those in our city?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   We are here in Hong Kong, our city, our home.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   We are the planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   We refuse to be silent about the wonder of God's light.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   We are here in this city to shine his light.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   For the next generation of Hong Kong, the youth of our city,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   those who carry upon them the hopes of the future and the brilliance of new and fresh hopes and ideas.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   May they know the comfort of the light of Christ.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   For the elderly, the poor, the vulnerable, the homeless, the asylum seeker, the survivor of trafficker,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   the domestic helper away from her family.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   May they know the comfort of the light of Christ.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   For those in the marketplace, the innovators, the business leaders,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   those who work tirelessly, the educators and the creators.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   May they know the rest of the light of Christ.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   For those in their government, leaders of industry, politicians and decision makers,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   those in power and those with authority to rule and direct.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   May they know the wisdom of the light of Christ.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And for those who are yet to hear the gospel of Jesus,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   those who have a hunger in their hearts for a different kind of life,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   those who are lost, who are soon to be found.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   May they know the salvation of the light of Christ.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Lord Jesus, hear our prayer.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   For in the long of the nights we accept the gift of Christ Jesus for ourselves,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   a personal act of faith for us, receiving God's charge upon us.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   In the long of the night we are changed forever by our God and Saviour, Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   who is God with us now and forever.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   For there is great joy at the end of the long of the night before the birth of Jesus.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   With the praise of the angels and the joy of the shepherds,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   the darkness of the world is turned on the axis of God's good light.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   We have much to celebrate and much to be grateful for together.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   So may we stand now together and proclaim for a final time
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   the glory that there is in a light that has come and in a light that is coming.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And as we sing together, may we find that joy rising in our hearts
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.320]   as we celebrate the hopeful arrival of Christ Jesus.
