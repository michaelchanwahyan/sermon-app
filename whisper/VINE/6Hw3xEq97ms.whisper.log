[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   - Thank you.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   Good morning.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.840]   I said this to the first service
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.920]   and I'll say it to you as well.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.440]   You may have come to church thinking
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.900]   that this will just be another normal Sunday.
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.580]   You're going to be disappointed.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.240]   God responds to desperation.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.760]   He responds to longing.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.080]   And I don't know about you,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.820]   but these are two things that I find in my life,
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.640]   in various stages of life,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.320]   but I find desperation and longing
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.020]   is sometimes our constant companions at time.
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.600]   And to those of you who are online today,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.920]   you might be sitting there with a cuppa.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.200]   Maybe you have a dog on your lap,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.520]   if it's anything like I am when I'm at home.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.260]   But also in that room is the presence of God.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.680]   And he will be there to encounter you
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.160]   if you are willing as well.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.240]   Some weeks ago during worship,
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.120]   Emma said that the one thing that all the encounters
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.820]   we've been looking at during this series,
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.620]   the one thing they had in common was desperation.
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.920]   So desperation, what is it?
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.300]   And how does it connect to encounters with God?
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.920]   Today we're looking at the story of Hannah.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.840]   So let's begin with the first part of her story.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.760]   We're going to be reading a lot of scripture today,
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.880]   so strap yourselves in.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.440]   Now there was a certain man of Ramatham, Zohem,
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.160]   of the mountains of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah,
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.120]   the son of Jerahim, the son of Elihu,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.040]   the son of Tohu, the son of Zoph, and Ephraimite.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.480]   And he had two wives, the name of one was Hannah,
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.520]   and the name of the other was Peninnah.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.200]   Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.120]   This man went up from his city yearly
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.560]   to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.240]   Also the two sons of Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.760]   the priests of the Lord, were there.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.480]   And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering,
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.240]   he would give portions to Peninnah, his wife,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.080]   and to all his sons and daughters.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.640]   But to Hannah he would give a double portion,
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.000]   for he loved Hannah,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.680]   although the Lord had closed her womb.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.360]   And her rival also provoked her severely
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.400]   to make her miserable,
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.960]   because the Lord had closed her womb.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.920]   So it was year by year,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.960]   when she went up to the house of the Lord,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.520]   that she provoked her.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.280]   Therefore she wept and did not eat.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.040]   Then Elkanah, her husband, said to her,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.520]   "Hannah, why do you weep?
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.720]   "Why do you not eat?
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.840]   "And why is your heart grieved?
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.560]   "Am I not better to you than ten sons?"
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.800]   So Hannah arose after they'd finished eating
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.600]   and drinking in Shiloh.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.800]   Now Eli the priest was sitting on the step
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.400]   of the doorpost of the tabernacle of the Lord,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.640]   and she was in bitterness of soul
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.680]   and prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.520]   I've just realised that my notes are all the way
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.040]   around the wrong way, so just hold on one second.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.840]   I've got page nine next after page one.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.120]   Just wait for one second.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.560]   We'll just reorder them.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.520]   Nearly there.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.720]   Okay.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.760]   Thank you for being so patient.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.920]   The writer makes sure that the very first thing
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.320]   we learn about Hannah is that she has no children.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.960]   Elkanah has two wives, Peninnah and Hannah.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.320]   Peninnah had children,
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.200]   but Hannah had none.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.960]   So why is this significant?
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.240]   In Hannah's day, it was considered so shameful
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.560]   to be barren that your husband could divorce you.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.040]   A barren woman could be treated harshly by the community
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.760]   because children were seen as blessings.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.200]   And if you couldn't have children,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.360]   you're perceived as being the opposite of being blessed.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.320]   You are seen as being cursed.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.000]   1 Samuel 1:8 and verse 10 captures the essence
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.320]   of her desperation.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.760]   Listen to these words again.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.480]   Hannah, why do you weep?
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.920]   Why do you not eat?
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.560]   Why is your heart grieved?
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.560]   And it goes on to say, Hannah was in bitterness of soul
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.000]   and prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.760]   Desperation is a state of extreme distress,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.440]   extreme anxiety or despair.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.080]   It's caused by a feeling of complete helplessness
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.680]   or absence of hope.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.240]   Hannah was desperate.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.960]   She was in despair.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.720]   Her husband's other wife, Peninnah, severely
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.920]   and deliberately provokes her to make her miserable.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.240]   And the Bible tells us that she has endured this for years.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.720]   Hannah is suffering from maret nefesh,
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.920]   which means a bitter soul,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.720]   and ani, which means affliction.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.720]   Let's take a moment to examine the reason
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.600]   why Hannah is experiencing affliction.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.000]   The Bible says that the Lord had closed her womb.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.200]   She is childless because of the Lord.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.040]   She is suffering because the Lord is allowing it.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.600]   In the Bible, all forms of fertility
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.720]   are presented as gifts from God.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.200]   So why was God keeping Hannah childless
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.000]   and allowing her to endure the ridicule
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.560]   of the people around her?
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.560]   Now, it's important in this moment to understand
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.600]   that God doesn't use infertility as a punishment.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.720]   But in Hannah's case, He was withholding children from her.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.680]   Before we explore this further,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.120]   we need to understand that Hannah's not the only one
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.640]   in the Bible who suffers affliction,
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.560]   who suffers from a bitter soul.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.200]   Naomi, after the death of her sons and her husband,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.640]   renames herself Marah, which means bitter.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.160]   And Job speaks in the bitterness of his spirit
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.200]   after enduring the loss of his family and all that he owned.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.560]   And yet all these desperate people have one thing in common.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.200]   Their desperation drives them to encounter God
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.840]   and to discover that God can work through their afflictions
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.040]   to bring them to a place of greater surrender
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.280]   and fruitfulness.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.040]   Hannah's desperation drove her to encounter God.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.920]   It could have driven her away,
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.280]   but instead it pushes her in closer.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.280]   She chooses to trust and she pours out her soul to God.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.640]   Let's read 1 Samuel 1, verses 11 to 18.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.840]   Then she made a vow and said, "O Lord of hosts,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.600]   "if you will indeed look on the affliction
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.640]   "of your maidservant and remember me
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.200]   "and not forget your maidservant,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.360]   "but will give your maidservant a male child,
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.720]   "then I will give him to the Lord
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.000]   "all the days of his life
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.560]   "and no razor shall come upon his head."
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.600]   And it happened as she continued praying before the Lord
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.800]   that Eli watched her mouth.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.400]   Now Hannah spoke in her heart, only her lips moved,
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.640]   but her voice was not heard.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.440]   Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.480]   So Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunk?
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.000]   "Put your wine away from you."
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.480]   But Hannah answered and said, "No, my Lord,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.160]   "I am a woman of sorrowful spirit.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   "I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.240]   "but have poured out my soul before the Lord.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.440]   "Do not consider your maidservant a wicked woman,
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.080]   "for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief,
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.480]   "I have spoken until now."
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.600]   Then Eli answered and said, "Go in peace
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.080]   "and the God of Israel grant your petition
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.120]   "which you have asked of him."
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.040]   And she said, "Let your maidservant find favour in your sight."
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.240]   So the woman went her way and ate
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.040]   and her face was no longer sad.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.240]   Just wanna take a moment here.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.200]   Something that I kind of,
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.960]   when I was reading these scriptures came to mind.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.760]   You know, when people are desperate,
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.840]   when they are grieving, when they're in despair,
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.440]   when they feel helpless,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.680]   they are not themselves.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.400]   And in these scriptures we see that Eli
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.640]   misunderstood Hannah in the first instance
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.840]   and he judged her.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.040]   And it can be very easy when we're surrounded
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.760]   by people sometimes who are desperate
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.880]   or walking alongside them.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   Sometimes it can be easy to misunderstand, easy to judge.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.200]   But I want us to be challenged by these scriptures
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   that in the end Eli becomes a source of blessing instead.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.600]   And he speaks peace over Hannah.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.920]   And when she leaves him, her face is no longer sad.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.440]   And I believe that there's a challenge in this to us
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.600]   because sometimes we are the desperate ones
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.400]   but sometimes we are walking with someone who is desperate.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.920]   May our heart response not be judgment.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.200]   But may it be compassion and blessing.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.360]   Hannah's desperation and barrenness
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.200]   prompted her to make commitments and vows
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.440]   that she would have never have made otherwise.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.280]   Maybe we need to understand just how desperate
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.080]   our condition is, how fragile our lives can be
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.360]   because unless we do, we are never going to see
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.800]   our equally desperate need for God.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.160]   Desperation is characterized by a sense of urgency,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.200]   a need for immediate relief.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   Desperation has a purpose.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.760]   Desperation is meant to drive us into the arms of God.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:45.240]   At the end of 2007, my husband Glenn and my four children,
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.400]   we packed up our lives in Darwin
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.000]   and we returned to Queensland in Australia
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.240]   to say our final goodbyes to family and friends
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.400]   because we were moving to Hong Kong
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.360]   to continue to work for a Christian NGO.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.680]   This was in response to God's leading
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.120]   and everything had been miraculous up to this point.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.920]   We had been gifted money out of the blue
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.480]   that covered all of our expenses
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.160]   and all of our plane tickets.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   We arrived in Queensland and our planned month stay
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.720]   before we left for Hong Kong turned into another month
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.600]   and then another month.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.200]   Something had caused a holdup with our visas
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.400]   and no one could give us a clear answer
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.080]   to what was going on.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.240]   We had four kids aged between three and 11
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.160]   and we were living like nomads,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.560]   moving from friends and family,
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.320]   sleeping on mattresses on the floor,
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.440]   spending weeks on farms
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.640]   and I was trying to teach our kids
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.280]   because the one month had turned into longer
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.720]   and they needed to have education.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:07.520]   Our one month turned into eight long months of waiting.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.160]   I distinctly remember when we reached the eight month mark
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.080]   and there didn't seem to be an end in sight.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.240]   We were at my parents' house
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.600]   and I went into the toilet and just sat there.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.920]   If you've got children, you'll know,
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.440]   sometimes that's the only place you can be by yourself
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.000]   and sometimes not even then.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.120]   I remember feeling so desperate
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.880]   and I remember crying out to God in anguish and in despair.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.760]   I reminded Him that He had brought us to this place,
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.440]   that it was in response to His leading
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.640]   that we were in this place.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.040]   This land of the in-between.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.520]   Have you experienced that place?
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.920]   The land of the in-between?
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.240]   You're not where you once were
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.320]   and you're not where you're meant to be going
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.560]   and you're stuck in this middle ground.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.520]   I told God I didn't understand why we were suffering.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.560]   I couldn't take it anymore.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.520]   I found myself surrendering afresh.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.680]   My family, my future.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.720]   And I told God, "You have to come through."
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.520]   It was in that same week that we heard
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.200]   that our visa applications had finally been approved.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.520]   When we arrived in Hong Kong,
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.560]   I saw our kids who had endured such change
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.200]   in the last eight months,
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.120]   such upheaval.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.400]   They hadn't had a home.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.680]   They hadn't had proper schooling.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:02.280]   But I saw them quickly adapt to Hong Kong.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.360]   It felt so easy.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.360]   It felt like perfect timing in a hundred different ways.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.880]   Desperation has a season and it has a purpose.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.400]   Desperation is meant to lead us to an encounter with God,
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.880]   a place where we discover hope, peace,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.240]   a place where we discover we can depend on God,
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.640]   a place where we can experience greater fruitfulness.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.720]   Hannah's desperation drives her to God.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.160]   In her deep anguish, Hannah prayed.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.960]   Prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly,
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.120]   she vowed, "Lord Almighty,
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.960]   if you will only look on your servant's misery
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.080]   and remember me and not forget your servant,
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.640]   but give me a son,
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.480]   I will give him to you for all the days of his life."
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.480]   Hannah's desperation drove her to God.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.120]   Where is your desperation driving you?
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:18.760]   Is your desperation causing you to try to figure out life
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.720]   on your own?
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:27.080]   Is it driving you to places that you were never meant to go?
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.680]   Or is it causing you to rely on things
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.240]   that you were never meant to place your trust in?
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.600]   You see, there are many stories in the Bible
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.040]   of desperate people.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.800]   And one of them, Jonah,
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.600]   his desperation drove him into the darkness
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.840]   of the belly of a big fish.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.640]   Has your desperation driven you into some dark places?
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.400]   When we choose to let our desperation drive us to God,
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   we encounter him.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.200]   Why?
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.840]   Because he hears the cries of the desperate.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.920]   And he responds.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.400]   He promises.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.920]   He says, "Draw near to me and I will draw near to you."
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.520]   Psalm 107 reminds us that no matter the cause
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.960]   of our desperation,
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.360]   when we cry out to the Lord,
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   he hears us and he delivers us from our distress.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.760]   Psalm 147 verse three says,
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   "He heals the brokenhearted and he binds up our wounds."
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.640]   Hannah cries out to God and her desperation
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.440]   causes her to encounter God
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.280]   and she experiences his faithfulness.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.560]   She regains her hope and her life becomes a better place
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.160]   and her life becomes far more fruitful
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.080]   than she could have ever imagined.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.360]   We pick up the story from 1 Samuel 1 verses 19 to 28.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.960]   Then they rose early in the morning
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.400]   and worshipped before the Lord
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   and returned and came to their house at Ramah.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.720]   And Elkanah knew Hannah, his wife,
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.040]   and the Lord remembered her.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.600]   So it came to pass in the process of time
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.360]   that Hannah conceived and bore a son
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.200]   and called his name Samuel,
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.960]   saying, "Because I have asked for him from the Lord."
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.200]   Now the man Elkanah and all his house
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.640]   went up to offer the Lord the yearly sacrifice
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.880]   and his vow,
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.720]   but Hannah did not go up,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.400]   for she said to her husband,
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.560]   "Not until the child is weaned,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.560]   then I will take him that he may appear before the Lord
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.720]   and remain there forever."
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.440]   So Elkanah, her husband, said to her,
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.120]   "Do what seems best to you.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.160]   Wait until you have weaned him.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.240]   Only let the Lord establish his word."
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.160]   Then the woman stayed and nursed her son
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.000]   until she had weaned him.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.160]   Now when she had weaned him,
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.360]   she took him up with her with three bulls,
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.240]   one ephah of flour and a skin of wine,
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.760]   and brought him to the house of the Lord in Shiloh,
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.080]   and the child was young.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.560]   Then they slaughtered a bull
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.440]   and brought the child to Eli,
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.360]   and she said, "Oh my Lord, as your soul lives, my Lord,
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.360]   I am the woman who stood by you here praying to the Lord.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.120]   For this child I prayed,
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.880]   and the Lord has granted me my petition,
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.520]   which I asked of him.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.760]   Therefore, I also have lent him to the Lord.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.840]   As long as he lives, he shall be lent to the Lord."
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.240]   So they worshipped the Lord there.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.160]   Hannah receives a son.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.880]   She names him Samuel, meaning God has heard.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.840]   And God redeems all her affliction.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.240]   He redeems all her suffering
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.080]   by unveiling his wondrous plan.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.720]   You see, Samuel goes on to serve as a priest.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   He becomes the first prophet and the last judge of Israel.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:08.080]   Samuel's life was pivotal in Israel's history.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.480]   If Hannah had not walked the journey she did,
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.000]   would she have been willing to surrender the one thing
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.720]   she wanted more than anything in this world, a child?
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.720]   I don't think so.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.520]   Some of you here today are wrestling with God
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.360]   because he is challenging you to surrender something
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.800]   in your life that is very precious to you.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.680]   It could be a dream for a spouse, a dream for a child.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.200]   He might be challenging you about an unhealthy relationship
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   that he wants you to let go of.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.880]   It could be a job that has become everything to you.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.760]   You're sitting here today and you know what it's like
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.400]   to feel afflicted, to not have peace.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.600]   Let your desperation drive you to God,
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.440]   drive you to surrender all those things into his hands.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:17.480]   You see, like Hannah, God's plans for you are better.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:24.680]   They far surpass your own.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.200]   Choose to trust like Hannah did, that his plans for you
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.560]   are to prosper you, to give you a future and a hope.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.440]   Hannah surrenders Samuel because she comes to understand
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.960]   that all good things, they come from God.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.320]   There's a lesson here.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   We are not to hold on tightly to the things God gives us.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:54.680]   We need to be willing to have open hands
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.120]   and a surrendered heart.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.920]   Hannah in her surrender discovers that when we do surrender
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.000]   God pours so much more into our lives.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.800]   Listen to her prayer after she surrenders Samuel
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   to the temple.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.120]   My heart rejoices in the Lord.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.080]   In the Lord my horn is lifted high,
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.320]   my mouth boasts over my enemies,
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.400]   for I delight in your deliverance.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.920]   There is no one holy like the Lord.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.540]   There is no one besides you.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.740]   There is no rock like our God.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.700]   Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.080]   such arrogance, for the Lord is a God who knows
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.720]   and by Him deeds are weighed.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.400]   The bows of the warriors are broken,
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   but those who stumbled are armed with strength.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.140]   Those who were full hire themselves out for food,
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.980]   but those who were hungry are hungry no more.
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.740]   She who was barren has born seven children,
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.520]   but she who has had many sons pines away.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.500]   The Lord brings death and makes alive,
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.340]   He brings down to the grave and raises up.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.360]   The Lord sends poverty and wealth,
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.240]   He humbles and He exalts.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.040]   He raises the poor from the dust
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.840]   and lifts the needy from the ash heap.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.000]   He seats them with princes and has them inherit
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.240]   a throne of honour.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.660]   For the foundations of the earth are the Lord's,
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.520]   on them He has set the world.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.080]   He will guard the feet of His faithful servants,
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.320]   but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.580]   It is not by strength that one prevails.
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.400]   Those who oppose the Lord will be broken.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.140]   The most high will thunder from heaven,
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.020]   the Lord will judge the ends of the earth,
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.900]   He will give strength to His King
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.340]   and exalt the horn of His anointed.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.880]   Hannah worships God because she gets a glimpse
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   of His sovereignty and how everything in our lives
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.440]   can be worked together for good
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.840]   when we are willing to live a surrendered life.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.500]   Hannah goes on to be blessed with five more children.
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:11.680]   God never intended her to stay barren and desperate
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.100]   and neither does He desire that for you.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:20.040]   If you are feeling barren, if you are feeling empty,
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   closed up, shut up, lifeless, hopeless, helpless,
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.960]   unfruitful, desperate or in despair,
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.460]   if you have been praying and longing for something
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:36.040]   for so long and feel as though God has forgotten you,
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.680]   know that in all of this, it has a season
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.200]   and it has a purpose.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   You were never meant to stay in this place of desperation.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.620]   Let it lead you to an encounter with God.
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.620]   Like Hannah, pour out your soul and cry out, "Remember me."
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.660]   Can you stand with me today?
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:11.720]   Can you just close your eyes
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.320]   and let every distraction just fade away?
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.900]   (gentle music)
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:23.560]   Hannah's desperation was not of her own making.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.440]   God had woven it into her story
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.140]   to bring her to a place of surrender,
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:35.800]   to draw her into His greatest story and purpose.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.320]   Some of you here today are like Hannah.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.600]   You are experiencing desperation
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.560]   but it is not of your own making.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.880]   God has woven it into your story
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.600]   to bring you to a place of surrender.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.960]   But some of you here today,
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.720]   you are experiencing desperation, deep dissatisfaction,
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.860]   even despair and it is of your own making.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:08.320]   Your choices have led you into some dark places,
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.880]   some empty places,
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.960]   places that lured with the promise of so much
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.540]   but have left you feeling hollow and ashamed.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:24.180]   Let your desperation drive you into the arms of God.
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:30.260]   And some today, you are not desperate enough.
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.360]   You're complacent.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.500]   You're letting life just wash over you.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.080]   The words directionless and meaningless,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.640]   you know those words.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.360]   Ephesians 5:14 says,
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.160]   Awake you who sleep,
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.840]   arise from the dead and Christ will give you light.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.240]   Encounter God today.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.100]   Surrender and receive His light,
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.340]   receive His presence.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.100]   (gentle music)
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.180]   As the worship team begin to worship over us,
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.940]   I wanna leave you with this picture from Ezekiel.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:25.420]   In Ezekiel, a man calls him into a river
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.360]   and it's a river made of water
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.140]   that flows from the temple of God.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.220]   It's the presence of God.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.700]   And Ezekiel is called into the river
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.020]   and he's called at first to ankle deep.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:44.900]   And then he's called on to knee deep.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.600]   And then he's called into his waist.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.100]   And then he's called to a place
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.300]   where he can no longer touch,
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.900]   into the raging river,
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.900]   a river where he is completely at the mercy
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.020]   of God's presence.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.220]   Where his feet are no longer on the ground,
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.620]   where he is completely surrendered,
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.960]   where he has no longer control.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.740]   And it's a reminder here today
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:22.380]   that you were never meant to stand ankle deep
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.820]   in God's presence.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:30.340]   God is calling us all to encounter Him
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.900]   in a place where we have surrendered
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.540]   all control into His hands
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.440]   and we are in His river, His presence,
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.620]   where He is in complete control.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.700]   So today we're gonna create some space
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.900]   and time right now for you to encounter God.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:57.500]   For you to just figure out where you are.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:02.740]   Are you on the bank of the river?
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.300]   Far from God's presence?
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.020]   Or are you in the shallows?
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.980]   Wherever you are,
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.900]   God's call to you and promise to you is,
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.100]   if you walk in,
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.460]   if you surrender,
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.660]   if you trust Him,
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.860]   He will meet you in the depths of the river.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.440]   (gentle music)
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.260]   (gentle music)
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.840]   (gentle music)
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.420]   (gentle music)
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.000]   (gentle music)
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.580]   (gentle music)
