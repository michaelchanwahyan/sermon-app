1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
 Have a seat, have a seat.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,700
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here,

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,900
 and you're relatively new to the Vine.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,300
 We're so glad you're with us.

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,900
 We're in week two of a four-week series

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,940
 on the topic of personal transformation.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,540
 And this idea in scripture

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,980
 that one of the primary ministries of Jesus

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,400
 is to, through his spirit and his truth,

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,140
 take us from the people that we are right now

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,940
 to the people that he longs for us to be,

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,580
 the people he's created us to be.

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,220
 And we're basing this series in Ezra, the book of Ezra,

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,420
 and specifically this moment of pivotal history

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,580
 for Israel's people,

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,700
 where they've been taken out of their exile in Babylon,

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,580
 the 70 years of exile in Babylon,

18
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,340
 and now released by Cyrus, the king of Persia,

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,900
 to go back to Jerusalem,

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,140
 and they're standing there in the book of Ezra

21
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,660
 in the rubble of Jerusalem,

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,580
 where Jerusalem, some 70 years before,

23
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,740
 had been this glorious city.

24
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,220
 The Babylonians had come in, pulled down the wall,

25
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,380
 destroyed the temple, 70 years in exile.

26
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,740
 Now the Jewish people,

27
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,900
 back standing in the rubble of the city they love.

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,340
 And as they're standing in that rubble,

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,420
 they hear the taunts of the enemies around them.

30
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,140
 And those taunts say, "Can you see the rubble around you?

31
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,800
 "Can you see how burnt out the stones are?

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,680
 "Can you see what was once glorious

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,580
 "now lies in ruin around you?

34
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,580
 "Can life ever come back to these burnt out stones?"

35
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,780
 And we said last week that for Israel, so for us,

36
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,140
 that there's things that lie in ruin in us,

37
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,100
 rubble that we're aware of in our own lives.

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,020
 Perhaps something that's happened to us in the past,

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,020
 something that we're not proud of.

40
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,280
 Perhaps the mistakes we've made,

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,320
 or maybe mistakes others made to us.

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,220
 Trauma that's embedded, hurt and shame,

43
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,060
 failure, pain, whatever it might be.

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,860
 But I think all of us can recognize

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,900
 that there's some things in our lives that lie in ruin.

46
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,100
 Rubble that we're asking ourselves,

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,900
 "Can anything good ever come from this?"

48
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,580
 That we wrestle, don't we, with sometimes recognizing

49
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,900
 that we're not the people that we wanna be.

50
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,920
 And we think, "You know what?

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,580
 "I can never be the person that I wanna be.

52
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,040
 "I can never be the person God wants me to be.

53
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,500
 "'Cause I've got this rubble and this ruin.

54
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,020
 "And have you seen it?"

55
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,900
 And if you could see it,

56
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,380
 you'd know that nothing good could ever come from this.

57
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,220
 What we saw last week in Ezra chapter three

58
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,360
 is this beautiful moment where the builders

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,380
 bring out the first stones to begin to rebuild the temple

60
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,140
 that had been destroyed some 70 years before.

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,140
 And as they bring it out,

62
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,740
 there's this sense of that question hanging over Israel.

63
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,540
 Are you going to agree with the taunts of the enemy,

64
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,020
 see the rubble around you,

65
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,600
 and think nothing good could ever come from it?

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,140
 Or are you gonna get a new mindset

67
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,180
 and then recognize that there is that rubble,

68
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,780
 but believe that in the power and in the mercy of God,

69
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,340
 the rain that falls by the Holy Spirit,

70
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,860
 what was rubble in this moment

71
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,180
 can become a new building in the next.

72
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,860
 And last week, I shared with you some ways

73
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,900
 in which I think God begins this process

74
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,500
 of personal transformation in our lives

75
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 in those areas that we recognize

76
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,180
 have that ruin and that rubble.

77
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,720
 And I wanted to summarize four things specifically

78
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,220
 that we talked about last week,

79
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,160
 just to help you get a sense of where we are in this series.

80
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,120
 And then we're gonna go from there.

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,240
 Here's the first thing we learned last week.

82
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,920
 Any process of personal transformation doesn't begin

83
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,760
 until we take an honest and sober look

84
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,440
 at the rubble that exists in our lives.

85
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,440
 We must understand and own what needs to change within us.

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,400
 No one has ever changed or transformed

87
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,120
 without first saying there's something inside of me

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
 that needs to change.

89
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,460
 And it's a sober thing to recognize

90
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,060
 that there is rubble and ruin,

91
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,260
 not to try to hide it,

92
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,420
 not to try to pretend it's not there,

93
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,980
 but to say, "Lord, I recognize it,

94
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,140
 and I know I can't do anything about it,

95
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,420
 but Lord, I bring it to you."

96
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,420
 We saw last week, number two,

97
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,300
 that God's work of renewal begins in the rubble.

98
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,740
 It's the very place where he does his best work.

99
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,580
 He doesn't remove our rubble, he restores it.

100
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,060
 The beautiful thing that we saw last week

101
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,480
 that those first kind of stones

102
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,080
 that were laid by the builders

103
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,280
 were out of that burnt out rubble

104
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,640
 where people thought nothing good could ever come of that.

105
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,320
 That becomes the stone the builders rejected,

106
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,160
 becomes the cornerstone.

107
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,720
 The things in our lives that we think,

108
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,600
 "Oh man, if only I could just get rid

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,360
 of all of that gunk and stuff."

110
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,960
 That's the stuff that God's playground.

111
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,800
 He looks at that stuff in your life,

112
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,360
 he rolls up his sleeves and says,

113
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,080
 "Come on, we're gonna do something

114
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,820
 with what you thought could never be transformed or renewed."

115
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,720
 Thirdly, we saw this last week,

116
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,600
 as Christians, worship must begin a process

117
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,880
 of transformation, not just complete it.

118
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
 When we are in the rubble,

119
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,720
 our worship should focus on the character of God

120
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,200
 over the circumstance of the world.

121
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,800
 We often worship as a response,

122
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,560
 worship out of the overflow

123
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,800
 or the outcome of something God's done.

124
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,120
 God's answered that prayer, he's come through for me,

125
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,000
 he's done that miracle, out of that I find worship.

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,320
 And that's absolutely right,

127
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,280
 we should worship out of outcome.

128
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,220
 But what we see in Ezra chapter three

129
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,080
 is that the Jewish people, the Israelites,

130
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,720
 began worship long before they saw an outcome.

131
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,000
 They lay the foundations of the stone

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,580
 through this act of worship, giving praise and glory,

133
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,300
 not because of what they can see with their eyes,

134
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,080
 not because of some thing that they're expecting God

135
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,540
 to do in the future, they praise for the character of God

136
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,100
 over the circumstance they find themselves in.

137
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,860
 And every move of personal transformation in your life

138
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,940
 will happen as we shift towards this worship

139
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,260
 of his character over our circumstance.

140
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,460
 Not an easy thing to do,

141
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,540
 but something glorious when we do it.

142
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,620
 And here's the fourth thing, we said this,

143
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,380
 we must understand that God's renewal takes time.

144
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,580
 It is a journey of many small, obedient decisions

145
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,700
 within a much larger framework

146
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,520
 of God's purposes in our lives.

147
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,180
 We would love a magic wand to be waved

148
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,260
 and suddenly that trauma goes, but the reality is,

149
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,620
 so often it's those small little steps

150
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,060
 that we take each day when we stay obedient

151
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,180
 to the thing that God's called us in our lives,

152
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,700
 that God shapes a masterpiece over time.

153
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,180
 Some of the most important things

154
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,740
 that God will ever do in your life,

155
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,100
 it's gonna take some time.

156
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,500
 And sometimes opening ourselves up

157
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,460
 to the journey of that process is primary

158
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,500
 in this season of transformation in our lives.

159
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,660
 So that was last week, if you weren't here last week,

160
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,140
 you can jump back online, you can hear it,

161
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,420
 or you can just take a photo of that slide

162
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,180
 and go, I've got it, all right?

163
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,220
 So last week, we focused on this idea

164
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,140
 that personal transformation begins with this.

165
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,820
 Today, I wanna talk about, as we continue this passage,

166
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,420
 I wanna talk about the environment

167
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,740
 by which personal transformation truly happens

168
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,980
 and how we here at The Vine might be able

169
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,380
 to create that kind of environment together.

170
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,740
 And to tell you about that, I wanna share a quick story.

171
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,340
 In my early 20s, I worked for a recruitment company.

172
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,740
 It was a headhunting firm,

173
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,540
 an international headhunting company

174
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,540
 that had offices in New York, in Hong Kong, and in Tokyo.

175
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,380
 And it just so happened that when I was about 23 years old,

176
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,100
 most of my clients, most of my candidates

177
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,700
 were based in Tokyo.

178
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,020
 So every eight weeks, I would have a business trip

179
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,460
 up to Tokyo, and for Monday to Friday,

180
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,660
 I would be in the Tokyo office,

181
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,180
 and I'd be meeting with my clients,

182
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,380
 meeting with my candidates and doing all that,

183
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,460
 then I'd come back to Hong Kong.

184
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,700
 But on this one particular trip,

185
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,180
 the company up in Japan asked me to stay for two weeks,

186
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,860
 which meant that I was gonna, for the first time,

187
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,660
 stay over the weekend in Tokyo.

188
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,460
 And I had come to Christ about three years prior to this.

189
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,620
 So I came to Jesus at university

190
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,460
 when I was in my early 20s.

191
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,380
 Now I'm 23, I'm in Tokyo, I'm staying over the weekend.

192
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,860
 And I decided I wanted to go and visit a church,

193
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,580
 not knowing anything really about the Christian context

194
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,060
 in Japan or about churches in general.

195
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,220
 And you also have to remember,

196
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,500
 I'm kinda dating myself here,

197
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,940
 but this was quite a while ago, okay, when I was 23.

198
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,980
 So the interwebs was not quite the thing that it is today.

199
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,780
 It existed, okay, we used it,

200
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,180
 but there was no Google Maps,

201
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,820
 there was no kinda stuff like that,

202
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,380
 none of that existed yet.

203
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,820
 So I did the smart thing,

204
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,260
 I turned to my Japanese colleague in the office,

205
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,940
 and I said, "Hey, would you make some phone calls for me

206
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,140
 "and find out if there's a church near where I'm staying?"

207
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,540
 And he's like, "Oh, Anjusan, Anjusan, okay, okay."

208
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,980
 (audience laughing)

209
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,660
 So he makes some phone calls across the day,

210
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,620
 and at the end of the day, he comes to me,

211
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,620
 he's like, "Oh, Anjusan,"

212
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,300
 he goes, "I find a church for you."

213
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,380
 And I'm like, "Oh, that's great."

214
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,580
 He's like, "It's only a 10-minute walk from your hotel

215
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,300
 "where you're staying, fantastic."

216
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,820
 He says, "It's on the 14th floor

217
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,180
 "of this industrial building,"

218
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,260
 and he gave me the details, he wrote it all out for me.

219
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,460
 So sure enough, on the Sunday,

220
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,620
 I think the service started at like 9.30 or 10,

221
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,620
 I can't fully remember,

222
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,900
 but I was there on time, got in the lift,

223
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,060
 I went up, the doors of the lift opened on the 14th floor,

224
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,780
 and I looked at what was in front of me,

225
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,460
 and I immediately began to think,

226
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,860
 I might need to fire my colleague.

227
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,740
 (audience laughing)

228
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,820
 In front of me was this old Japanese lady,

229
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,980
 beautiful lady, probably in her late 70s, early 80s,

230
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,060
 wearing a very formal Japanese outfit,

231
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,260
 hunched a little bit because of her age.

232
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,140
 When she saw the doors open, her eyes just lit up.

233
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,780
 She was so excited.

234
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,220
 She's like, "A foreigner has come to our church.

235
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,540
 "Like, revival is breaking out."

236
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,860
 And she gives me like this little brochure

237
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,460
 that was all in Japanese.

238
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,500
 She opens this door and leads me into this room.

239
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,460
 I go into this room.

240
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,940
 There's probably about 50 chairs in this room,

241
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,780
 a small kind of room, about 50 chairs.

242
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,900
 There's about 15 people standing in the room.

243
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,700
 As I come in, all 15 people turn around,

244
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
 and I immediately realize that the youngest person

245
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,180
 in that room, other than me, was probably about 78.

246
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,700
 (audience laughing)

247
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,700
 And they were all super conservative, old Japanese people.

248
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,100
 And they all stared at me with eyes lit up,

249
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,260
 just like the lady at the entrance.

250
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,340
 And they all rushed over me,

251
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,660
 and it was that awkward moment when you're not Japanese,

252
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,500
 you don't know what to do.

253
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,780
 It's like, do you bow?

254
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,100
 They're all bowing.

255
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,620
 They're all welcoming me.

256
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,220
 They're speaking Japanese.

257
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,620
 I don't speak Japanese.

258
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,860
 They obviously don't speak much English.

259
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,460
 Super awkward, but everybody's being super friendly,

260
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,780
 super nice, and I'm like, "Okay, I guess I'll go."

261
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
 I can't leave now.

262
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,260
 That would be the worst thing ever.

263
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,100
 See you guys.

264
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,740
 Nice to, you know.

265
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,460
 So I'm like, I'm stuck.

266
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,860
 Anyway, this guy, probably about 82, 83,

267
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,020
 he grabbed me and he pulled me down the aisle.

268
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,260
 He stood next to me.

269
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,100
 He's like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh," you know, like this.

270
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,740
 (audience laughing)

271
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,260
 And then worship started.

272
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,500
 Now, when worship started, half of the congregation

273
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,180
 got up on stage, 'cause they were the worship team, right?

274
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,660
 So there was like six of us left, six on the stage.

275
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,220
 They had like keyboardists and drummers

276
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,580
 and guitarists and singers.

277
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,140
 Over the next 15 minutes,

278
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,980
 it's hard to describe to you that experience,

279
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,780
 but I would say it like this.

280
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,780
 It was very easily the worst worship

281
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,020
 I have ever heard in my life.

282
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,100
 Like not just 23, but now that I'm 50, okay?

283
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,700
 The worst, the guitar player, he gets so old,

284
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,620
 he could barely fret a chord, okay?

285
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,220
 The pianist, I think, was deaf

286
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,580
 because they were pounding the keys as hard as they could.

287
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,020
 The drummer must have probably been able to drum

288
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,020
 50 years ago, but right now,

289
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,700
 he could not find a rhythm at all.

290
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,620
 And I realized every single person had decided

291
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,700
 that they had a song they wanted to bring to worship,

292
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,060
 but none of them have talked to each other about it,

293
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,100
 and they're all just playing whatever they want to play.

294
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,220
 And I haven't even told you yet about the singers.

295
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,340
 (audience laughing)

296
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,900
 They were terrible.

297
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,740
 Like so bad, like couldn't hold a tune,

298
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,620
 couldn't do anything.

299
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,740
 And I'm standing there thinking,

300
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,260
 this is the worst thing I've ever heard.

301
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,300
 And I turn to the guy next to me,

302
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,580
 and I'm about to go like,

303
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,900
 (imitates guitar playing)

304
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,180
 you know, like this.

305
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,420
 And he's like, he's like lost like 30 years.

306
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,420
 He's jumping up in the air,

307
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,740
 his arms are pumped up in the air,

308
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,780
 and I'm thinking, what is going on?

309
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,860
 For me, this is the kind of worship

310
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,660
 that makes Jesus not want to come back to the world.

311
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,280
 (audience laughing)

312
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,300
 It's the kind of worship that keeps Jesus away.

313
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
 I don't want to be anywhere near those humans.

314
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,580
 But this guy's going like crazy,

315
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,340
 and he's shouting something.

316
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,180
 Here's what he's shouting.

317
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,100
 He's going, he's saying,

318
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,600
 (imitates guitar playing)

319
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,660
 He turns to me, he grabs me by the arms.

320
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,500
 (imitates guitar playing)

321
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,140
 He looked like really angry,

322
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,860
 like (imitates guitar playing)

323
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,180
 I'm thinking maybe, I have no idea what (imitates guitar playing)

324
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,560
 but I'm thinking maybe it's the name

325
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
 of the actual worship pastor

326
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,440
 who was sick and didn't show up that day.

327
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,360
 And he's like, oh, Tenkuo Saku, where is he?

328
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,640
 I'm like, yes, Tenkuo Saku, I wish he was here too.

329
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,120
 But he's screaming.

330
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,840
 And the reason why I remember Tenkuo Saku

331
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,560
 is 'cause he said it like 100 times,

332
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,360
 top of his lung, Tenkuo Saku, Tenkuo Saku.

333
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,800
 Monday morning, I'm back at the office,

334
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,520
 and I find my colleague.

335
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,600
 (audience laughing)

336
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,960
 And after slapping him around a little bit,

337
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,060
 I said to him, I said, can you define a word for me?

338
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,940
 I heard at this church this word, Tenkuo Saku.

339
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,220
 What does Tenkuo Saku mean?

340
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,460
 And he's like, oh, this is interesting.

341
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,940
 This is not a standard Japanese word.

342
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,060
 It's not a word that I know,

343
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,220
 but it's a conjoint of lots of things coming.

344
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,620
 He starts to explain all this stuff.

345
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,620
 And he's like, it's like lots of different ideas

346
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,260
 brought down into this one word.

347
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,860
 And I'm like, okay, well, what are the ideas?

348
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,620
 And he said, well, there's a shaking, a tearing,

349
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,700
 and then there's like the sky.

350
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,680
 So I said, you mean it's like a shaking the sky?

351
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,040
 He's like, yes, yes, but also like tearing,

352
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,120
 wanting to tear the sky.

353
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,920
 And I'm like, could it be like heaven,

354
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,360
 like tear the heavens, shake the heavens?

355
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,800
 He's like, yes, yes, yes, like shake the heavens.

356
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,120
 It's funny, isn't it?

357
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,000
 How you can have, two people,

358
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,840
 can have exactly the same experience,

359
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,640
 but have completely different reactions

360
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,440
 and perspectives of it.

361
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,040
 I show up in this church with my baggage of worship

362
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,480
 that I had, which was the vines worship.

363
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,480
 Oh yeah, great musicians, perfect sound.

364
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,040
 Everybody in tune, actually playing the same song.

365
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,020
 Singing in tune, the beautiful sense

366
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,180
 of God's presence among.

367
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,220
 I mean, this was me.

368
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,460
 That's what constituted good worship.

369
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,540
 Are you with me?

370
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,300
 So I walk into that room, knowing the baggage,

371
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,660
 having the history of that kind of worship,

372
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,700
 and I'm experiencing what I'm experiencing.

373
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
 And I'm thinking, this is not worship at all,

374
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,020
 but the Japanese man next to me,

375
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,480
 who maybe has never heard any other kind of worship

376
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,940
 than what was happening in that room.

377
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,100
 Maybe that church always, that's just been the way it is.

378
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,500
 It's a bit of a free for all, but he's standing there

379
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,860
 and he's like, I'm not here to hear skillful musicians.

380
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,660
 I'm here to praise the one that saved me.

381
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,900
 And I'm gonna stand here and go,

382
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,300
 take in new Osaka, rape open the heavens Lord,

383
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,140
 bring your glory to this earth.

384
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,820
 And I don't care what the musicians are doing

385
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,580
 and how it sounds, it's about my heart

386
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,340
 and honoring the one, even if we're not honoring him

387
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,180
 with the skills.

388
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,580
 Rip open, shake open the heavens.

389
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,020
 I, I wanted to run away.

390
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,700
 That church, we're running in.

391
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,640
 I wanted to weep.

392
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,180
 They wanted to worship.

393
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,740
 And as we get back to this moment

394
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,540
 that Ezra's describing for us in chapter three,

395
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,900
 as this incredible things happening

396
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,640
 with the rebuilding of the temple,

397
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,100
 almost exactly the same thing happens here.

398
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,260
 And as we begin to unpack the reality

399
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,940
 of what is happening in these moments,

400
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,540
 I think we can see something quite profound

401
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,240
 that might help to shape our personal growth in moment two.

402
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,700
 Let me read this to you from Ezra three,

403
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,540
 picking up from where we read last week.

404
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,120
 When the builders laid the foundation

405
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,580
 of the temple of the Lord, the priests in their vestments

406
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,180
 and with trumpets and the Levites,

407
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,200
 the sons of Asper and the symbols,

408
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,520
 took their places to praise the Lord

409
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,100
 as prescribed by David, King of Israel.

410
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,020
 With praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord,

411
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,780
 he is good, his love endures forever.

412
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,900
 And all the people gave a great shout of praise

413
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,700
 to the Lord because the foundation

414
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,860
 of the house of the Lord was laid.

415
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,820
 Now listen to this.

416
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,660
 But many of the older priests and Levites

417
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,980
 and family heads who had seen the former temple

418
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,360
 wept aloud when they saw the foundations

419
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,180
 of this temple being laid.

420
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,000
 While many others shouted for joy.

421
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,780
 No one could distinguish the sounds of the shouts of joy

422
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,360
 from the sound of weeping

423
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,880
 because the people made so much noise.

424
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,160
 Father, as we open this up for each person here,

425
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,600
 I pray that Lord, you would do something profound for us

426
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,780
 as we honor the reality of every person's story.

427
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,960
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name, amen.

428
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,280
 One group of people, two very different reactions.

429
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,760
 The whole group seeing the same thing.

430
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,040
 They see the rubble of Jerusalem lying around them.

431
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,360
 They see the stones being brought in

432
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,920
 to be laid in the temple.

433
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,200
 Everybody seeing the same thing,

434
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,040
 two very different reactions.

435
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,240
 On the one side, there are these older people.

436
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,960
 Now, actually, Ezra tells us something

437
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,080
 really important in the text.

438
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,680
 He says, they're so old, he doesn't quite say it that way,

439
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,000
 but that's my way of saying it.

440
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
 They're so old that they actually had seen

441
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,840
 the former temple.

442
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,920
 Now, remember the history here.

443
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,040
 They were in exile for 70 years.

444
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,240
 So anybody returning back to Jerusalem

445
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,760
 who was over the age of about 74

446
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
 in their early 80s into their 90s,

447
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,840
 they would have seen the former temple.

448
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,160
 Not only that, but they probably would have worshipped

449
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,400
 in the former temple.

450
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,600
 And they would have seen this glorious temple.

451
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,060
 There's an image here coming up behind me,

452
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,080
 which is just this beautiful artist's rendition

453
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,040
 from the Bible Society

454
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,600
 of what that temple would have looked like.

455
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,120
 It was one of the most glorious architectural wonders

456
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,200
 of that ancient world.

457
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,000
 And these people, these older Israelites,

458
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,240
 Levites and priests and family heads,

459
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,160
 had, with their own eyes, seen the glory of that temple.

460
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,760
 Not only that, but they would have experienced

461
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,660
 the power of God's presence within it.

462
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,360
 Now, I wanna just give you a sense

463
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,440
 of what the power of that presence was like

464
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,040
 by reading you the short passage

465
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,720
 about the dedication of the first temple.

466
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,000
 Now, this was years, years before.

467
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,320
 Obviously, none of these people were there for that moment.

468
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,000
 But this is the moment where Solomon dedicates the temple,

469
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,800
 that temple you're seeing on the screen.

470
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,600
 This is 2 Chronicles 7, verses one to three.

471
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,920
 When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven

472
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,680
 and consumed the burnt offering and sacrifices,

473
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,400
 and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.

474
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,400
 The priest could not enter the temple of the Lord

475
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,760
 because the glory of the Lord filled it.

476
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,760
 When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down

477
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,440
 and the glory of the Lord above the temple,

478
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,840
 they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground,

479
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,560
 and they worshipped and gave thanks to the Lord,

480
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,160
 saying, "He is good.

481
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,080
 "His love endures forever."

482
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,560
 So here's the interesting thing.

483
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,760
 The older Levites and priests now, in Ezra's time,

484
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,160
 obviously, they weren't there in that moment

485
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,640
 of the first dedication of the temple,

486
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,920
 but 'cause they're the Levites and the priests,

487
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,920
 they know the story, they know exactly what's happened,

488
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,120
 they know what was happening,

489
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,440
 and they're now standing in the rubble of that temple,

490
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,960
 and they're weeping, and they're weeping because guess what?

491
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,680
 The people of Israel are singing the same song,

492
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,920
 but it's not having the same result.

493
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,280
 Notice in the Ezra passage,

494
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,400
 as Ezra, if you bring it up on the screen.

495
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,960
 Ezra said that the people sing the same thing.

496
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,560
 "He is good, his love endures forever."

497
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,120
 And these older ones who know that that was sung

498
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,520
 when the first temple was laid,

499
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,000
 they're looking at this second temple,

500
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,240
 and they're like, "Are we crazy?

501
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,880
 "Can you not see the rubble that's around us?

502
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,240
 "I remember what it used to look like.

503
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,120
 "I remember in my mind the glory of this temple.

504
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,940
 "I felt the power of the presence of God

505
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,180
 "who filled that temple up until the moment

506
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,160
 "that the Babylonians tore it down,

507
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,140
 "and now we're standing here, and you're going,

508
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,360
 "'Woo-hoo, he is good,' and they're thinking,

509
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,660
 "'No, everything is lost.

510
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,300
 "'It's all gone.

511
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,920
 "'This is not good.

512
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,320
 "'We saw it before.

513
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,960
 "'We knew how great it was,

514
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,440
 "'but right here, it isn't great anymore.'"

515
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,680
 They're weeping for what they have lost.

516
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,360
 They're weeping, not looking forward and going,

517
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,740
 "Hey, here's what God's about to do."

518
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,400
 They're weeping 'cause all they can think about

519
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,640
 is what they've lost.

520
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,860
 They're not in a situation where they're thinking

521
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,260
 about what they're about to gain.

522
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,960
 They're weeping because of just all the things

523
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,280
 that they've already lost.

524
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,120
 I wonder if that resonates with any of you here.

525
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,960
 I know it does for me.

526
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,220
 I know it's quite easy to think that my best years

527
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,660
 of my life are already in the rearview mirror,

528
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,260
 like those moments back in the old days.

529
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,200
 Some people in my generation and above,

530
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,700
 we have this phrase, if you're young here,

531
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,400
 it will annoy you, I'm sure, and you've heard it.

532
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,660
 Many times, "Oh, in our day."

533
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,240
 Well, if only you'd been in my time.

534
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,840
 In our day, there was no social media.

535
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,180
 People actually talked to each other.

536
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,840
 It was great.

537
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,960
 We actually had community in my day,

538
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,100
 whatever it might be.

539
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,580
 We know what it's like, isn't it,

540
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,040
 to look back on the past with rose-tinted spectacles,

541
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,060
 to look back and go, "Oh, man, I remember those days.

542
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,900
 "Oh, that was great.

543
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,520
 "It's not so great anymore, but it was awesome back there."

544
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,400
 We do this not just in terms of history and experience.

545
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,040
 We do this in terms of relationships.

546
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,920
 How many of us here might be honest and say,

547
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,160
 "Man, I wish my husband would be like he was

548
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,520
 "when we first got married.

549
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,200
 "I wish my relationship was as romantic

550
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,040
 "as it was when we first started dating.

551
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,740
 "Now it feels like my spouse doesn't even look at me."

552
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,980
 As humans, we have this tendency to always look back

553
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,280
 on the things in the past with these rose-colored glasses,

554
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,920
 kind of being selective about what we remember

555
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,400
 and trying to pull that to kind of say something

556
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,560
 about what it is today.

557
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,080
 But when you look back and all your focus is

558
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,680
 back to the glory of something in the past,

559
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,760
 here's what happens.

560
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,860
 You become blind to the importance

561
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,080
 of your presence in the future.

562
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,280
 You just get consumed by all this stuff over here,

563
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,360
 and it stops you from actually moving forward.

564
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
 See, in seasons of personal transformation,

565
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,160
 it's tempting to idolize the past,

566
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,980
 demonize the presence, and fear the future.

567
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,100
 It's really tempting for us to do that.

568
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,820
 And this is, I think, what the older Israelites

569
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,900
 and the priests are in danger of doing in this moment.

570
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,500
 They're idolizing the past.

571
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,020
 "Oh man, if you had seen that previous temple,

572
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,140
 "if you had seen the power that was there,

573
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,900
 "oh, and you think this is good,

574
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,140
 "you're worshiping to this?"

575
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,980
 It's like me in that church in Japan.

576
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,780
 "Really, you guys, you're worshiping to this?"

577
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,460
 And there's this moment, isn't there,

578
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,900
 where we bring the baggage and we say,

579
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,500
 "Well, if it's not like it was back then,

580
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,860
 "well, it can't be any good."

581
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,140
 And the priests and the Levites,

582
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,180
 they're in danger in this moment of weeping

583
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,900
 from completely missing the new thing God wants to do.

584
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,500
 And they're so connected back to the pain

585
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,820
 of what they've lost that they can't even see

586
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,620
 what they're about to gain.

587
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,820
 Not only that, but I think they're also in danger

588
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,020
 of wanting to stop the others from building.

589
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,020
 Like, "There's no point even trying.

590
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,100
 "We can't get back."

591
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,300
 That was the glorious moment.

592
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
 That was the great temple.

593
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,100
 Look, just put your tools down.

594
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,500
 There's no spirit here.

595
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,940
 There's no power here.

596
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,980
 Let's just give up.

597
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,100
 We're just singing words without anything.

598
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,580
 They're in danger of allowing the missing

599
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,820
 of the thing in the past to actually begin to say,

600
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,660
 "We're not even gonna bother

601
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,300
 "to move forward with the present."

602
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:18,660
 See, when you allow the grief of your past

603
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,500
 to continue to speak louder to you

604
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,100
 than the hope of your future,

605
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,620
 you are always going to end up in a situation

606
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,580
 where you're likely to resist and to not embrace

607
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,420
 the very transformation that God wants to do in your life.

608
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:36,100
 And in this moment, I think this is where

609
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,300
 these older people are, two feet here,

610
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:45,300
 and God's here saying, "Watch what I'm about to do."

611
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,380
 But we can actually resist the transformation

612
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,060
 God wants to bring us.

613
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,500
 If we're trying to get ourselves back

614
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,260
 to an old version of ourselves.

615
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,300
 The Hebrew word for restoration in Scripture

616
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,620
 is not go back.

617
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,580
 You know, like you think about it with a car.

618
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,660
 What is it like to restore an old car?

619
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,940
 The idea is to make it look as good as it did originally.

620
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,420
 That's not the Hebrew word.

621
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,500
 Restoration in Scripture is not about trying

622
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,100
 to get you back to the perfect image

623
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,300
 of the thing in the past.

624
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,580
 It's actually about taking you forward to the new thing.

625
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,460
 Paul would say, "Anybody who's in Christ Jesus is what?

626
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,620
 "A new creation.

627
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,860
 "The old is gone.

628
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,100
 "The new has come."

629
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,220
 But here's the older people in Israel,

630
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,020
 and they're weeping for what has been lost

631
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,820
 when God's saying, "Can't you see what you're about to gain?"

632
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,580
 Now, stay with me for a second,

633
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,580
 because I'm not saying that weeping is wrong.

634
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,420
 I'm not saying that mourning is bad,

635
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,060
 that we shouldn't feel emotions and hurt and pain,

636
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,300
 and we shouldn't pray.

637
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,500
 In fact, it's completely the opposite of that.

638
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,820
 Scripture has so much to say about the wonder

639
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,420
 of what it is for us humans to feel and have emotion

640
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,220
 and to know pain and to know trauma

641
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,380
 and to have to try to process it.

642
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,820
 Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount,

643
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,100
 Matthew 5:4, says to everybody around him,

644
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,980
 he said, "Blessed are those who mourn,

645
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,180
 "for they will be comforted."

646
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,740
 In other words, it's okay to have pain.

647
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,660
 It's okay to look back and go,

648
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,100
 "Man, that was something great there that I've lost."

649
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,380
 It's all right to feel the disappointment and the hurt.

650
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,940
 In fact, the Christian religion

651
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,340
 is one of the most beautiful religions,

652
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,100
 because rather than trying to simply explain our suffering,

653
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,820
 the Christian religion has a God

654
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,940
 who joins us in that suffering.

655
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,140
 That's a radical thing.

656
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,300
 There's no other religion,

657
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,860
 there's no other faith in the world where that happens,

658
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,140
 where God will come and be a part of the pain

659
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,900
 and the suffering of this world.

660
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,180
 Jesus himself weeps out loud, bitterly,

661
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,580
 when his best friend, Lazarus, dies.

662
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,300
 He feels the pain, and he doesn't try to hide it.

663
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,900
 Even though he knows he's about to bring him back to life.

664
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,220
 Hit your head around that one for a moment.

665
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,620
 He weeps in the Garden of Gethsemane,

666
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,780
 knowing the weight of what it's going to be

667
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,060
 to take the sin of the world on his shoulders

668
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,260
 in a desperate cry before his father,

669
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,660
 if there's any other way,

670
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,300
 and he weeps and weeps in that moment,

671
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,820
 and yet he knows that the Lord, his father,

672
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,340
 is still going to be glorified.

673
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,620
 He knows the victory's there,

674
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,700
 but he still finds a place to weep.

675
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,340
 This is the beautiful thing about our faith.

676
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,740
 In Jesus, we do not just have a God of the sufferers,

677
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,940
 we have a God who suffers.

678
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,900
 Come on, church.

679
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,660
 That's a profound thought.

680
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:35,540
 That means that in my suffering, in my pain, in my hurt,

681
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,100
 in the things that I'm holding in my spirit,

682
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,420
 I've got a God who understands that.

683
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,180
 I've got a God who's not sitting on a cloud going,

684
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,580
 "Oh, yeah, yeah, you suffer, that must be hard."

685
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,300
 I've got a God who's walked in my shoes,

686
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,420
 knows that pain, felt it himself,

687
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,580
 worse than I will ever find it.

688
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,620
 And so I have somebody to turn to

689
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,380
 who understands what's going on in my life

690
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,580
 and can meet me in the reality of the pain

691
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,020
 and the brokenness that I feel.

692
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,820
 That liberates me to mourn.

693
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,780
 That allows me to bring my grief.

694
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,580
 This is why we have the lament Psalms in the Psalms.

695
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,580
 It's why we have these beautiful poems

696
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,500
 where God's people say, "Why have you forsaken me?

697
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,660
 "Where are you, God?

698
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,820
 "Why have you left me?

699
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
 "Why have you gone?"

700
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,380
 And we begin to have these beautiful expressions.

701
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,540
 And if I was writing the Bible and putting it together,

702
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,740
 I would have taken those things and left them out.

703
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,580
 Like, "Oh, that's a bit harsh.

704
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,060
 "You can't speak to God that way.

705
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,820
 "Let's just put that one aside."

706
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,500
 No, no, they're in the Scriptures to give us permission

707
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,180
 to bring our big feelings to God,

708
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,740
 to not bury them under the ground

709
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,140
 or try to push them away or pretend that they're not there.

710
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,100
 We have a God who's joined us in our suffering.

711
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,740
 Our suffering always has a place with him.

712
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,460
 I don't need to run from it.

713
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,940
 I don't need to hide from it.

714
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,300
 Equally, though, I don't need to let it overwhelm me

715
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,740
 to the point where I can no longer see

716
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,540
 what God's doing in the midst of it.

717
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,460
 You see, when we weep before God, here's what we do.

718
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,380
 We acknowledge our humanity and his divinity.

719
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,420
 We proclaim through our tears, faith and trust

720
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,060
 that he alone is able to comfort and heal.

721
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,940
 That's the wonder of what it is to weep.

722
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,220
 That's the beauty of what it is to offer it.

723
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,860
 And in this moment, yes, I do think that they're weeping

724
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,620
 because of what they feel they've lost,

725
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,340
 but I think there's a bigger point

726
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,860
 to their weeping in this moment.

727
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,500
 They're weeping because they realize

728
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,540
 that they are aligning themselves to the pain

729
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,020
 that is on the father's heart.

730
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,540
 You see, they're weeping for what I would argue

731
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,060
 is something called godly sorrow.

732
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,300
 Gotta remember the history again.

733
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,580
 For 70 years, they're in exile.

734
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,940
 And during that time, they're reflecting

735
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,780
 and they're thinking about what happened.

736
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,980
 And they're asking one critical question.

737
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,820
 Why did the walls come down around Jerusalem?

738
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,780
 Why did the temple get destroyed?

739
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,020
 And the prophets and the artisans

740
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,980
 and the writers of the Psalms in that time,

741
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,180
 Psalm 131, by the rivers of Babylon,

742
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,900
 we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.

743
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
 Their writers and their poets and their artists

744
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,980
 helped them to understand that the reason

745
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,500
 why they're in exile is not because God's abandoned them,

746
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,300
 not because God's turned his back on them,

747
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,740
 which is what they thought originally,

748
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,820
 but as they process it, think about it,

749
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,260
 spiritually God speaks in them,

750
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:28,940
 they realize they're in that place because of their choices.

751
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,860
 And the prophets begin to say, idolatry and injustice.

752
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,420
 Idolatry in terms of how they were sharing their heart

753
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,580
 no longer with Yahweh, but with other gods and deities.

754
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,460
 Injustice where through that,

755
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,460
 they were treating themselves and others around them

756
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,260
 poorly and wrongly.

757
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,460
 And because idolatry and injustice

758
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,260
 was so ripe in their midst,

759
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,460
 God brings the actions, the consequences

760
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,580
 to their sinful choices.

761
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,060
 And I think what's happening here for the older priests,

762
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,660
 as they're standing in the rubble, they're weeping,

763
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,140
 not just because they feel like they've lost something,

764
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,140
 they're weeping because they realize this is our fault.

765
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:15,300
 We did this, us.

766
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,660
 And I think there's something happening in their hearts

767
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,940
 that is aligning them to the heart of God.

768
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,740
 They're beginning to see sin the way that God sees it,

769
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,500
 and they're beginning to bring these tears of repentance,

770
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,580
 these beautiful, this is not the kind of tears of like,

771
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,820
 "Oh my gosh, I'm so bad, I've screwed up,

772
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,700
 "I'm such a terrible person."

773
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,380
 This is like, I see finally what God sees about brokenness

774
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,900
 and idolatry and injustice, and it is not right.

775
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,740
 And it breaks my heart like it breaks God's heart.

776
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,140
 And it breaks me even more 'cause I realize

777
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,220
 I was the one that did this.

778
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,660
 And Lord, I weep because as I look at the rubble,

779
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,500
 I know that we brought the walls down.

780
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,220
 And this profound sense of godly sorrow,

781
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,220
 not to beat myself up 'cause I'm the worst in the world,

782
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:11,100
 but a beautiful recognition that I finally agree with God

783
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,740
 and I know that he can liberate me,

784
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,900
 that he can forgive me and give me grace and mercy

785
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,740
 brings me to tears.

786
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,400
 Some of you here, it's really important you hear this,

787
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,020
 some of you here, your own journey

788
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,540
 and personal transformation will not begin

789
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,020
 until you actually have the courage to agree

790
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,940
 with how God sees sin and really, truly grieve

791
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,840
 its persistent presence in your life.

792
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,660
 I know it's not an easy word, but that's truth.

793
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,940
 Some of us, until we actually find ourselves

794
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,580
 like those Levites and the priests, man,

795
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,660
 I'm so sorry, Lord.

796
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:56,100
 I'm finally admitting and owning that this happened.

797
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,380
 And Lord, I come to you because I have the courage

798
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,100
 to agree with you in how I see myself.

799
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,940
 I'm sorry, Lord.

800
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,460
 But I'm not just sorry as in like, oh, I'm the worst.

801
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,660
 I'm sorry because I know I don't deserve it,

802
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,220
 I don't understand it, but there is grace

803
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,900
 and there is mercy in you and you forgive me

804
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,420
 and when I know that I don't deserve your forgiveness,

805
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,500
 but you give it to me, it makes the tears come more.

806
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,660
 And there's this beautiful moment

807
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,780
 where these people are weeping,

808
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,460
 maybe for the first time,

809
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,460
 and saying, Lord, would you forgive us?

810
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,540
 I love how the fact that Ezra takes that moment

811
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,620
 and he tells us that right alongside of it,

812
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,300
 there's a whole bunch of young people praising Jesus,

813
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,020
 praising the Lord, so excited about what's happening.

814
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,140
 Both of these things are right in the same moment.

815
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,980
 It was right for the older people to go,

816
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,060
 oh man, I've lost something.

817
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,940
 Oh man, we've done something.

818
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,340
 Lord, we're sorry.

819
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,980
 But it was also right for the young ones to stand around

820
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,660
 and go, isn't he good?

821
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,660
 Isn't he great?

822
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,580
 He is good.

823
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,380
 His love does endure forever

824
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,940
 'cause he's about to start a new process within us.

825
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,340
 This starting point of weeping

826
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,420
 is the beginning point of praising.

827
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,460
 As we bring weeping and worshiping side by side,

828
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,740
 something truly transformative begins to happen in our lives.

829
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,460
 We truly begin to become the people

830
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,220
 that God has always called us to be.

831
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,740
 This is the very soundtrack to what change is in our lives.

832
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,740
 We often think that personal transformation is linear.

833
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,540
 I'm just gonna have a season of weeping, weeping,

834
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,460
 weeping, weeping, and then boom, I'm in eternity of praise.

835
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,700
 The human experience isn't that way.

836
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,860
 Our human experience is weeping and worship side by side.

837
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,620
 Days where we feel great, days where we're struggling.

838
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,980
 Maybe even in the same day, moments of joy

839
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,900
 coupled with moments of grief.

840
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,100
 And what we're seeing in this passage

841
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,140
 is when we allow that to happen,

842
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,940
 when we don't shy away from it,

843
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,420
 when we don't try to bury it,

844
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,020
 when we bring worship and weeping mingled together,

845
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,140
 something profound happens.

846
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,620
 And the greatest moments of personal transformation happen

847
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,660
 when those two things are allowed to exist

848
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,460
 in our lives together.

849
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,420
 Some of your greatest joys can only be formed

850
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,020
 out of your deepest pain.

851
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,860
 Come on, church.

852
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,300
 Some of your greatest joys can only be found,

853
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,940
 forged in you out of your deepest pain.

854
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,620
 When I was 32 years old,

855
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,820
 I received the diagnosis of azuspermia,

856
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,300
 which means that I am unable

857
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,340
 to father children biologically.

858
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,820
 And this was at the end of an eight-year journey

859
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,940
 when my wife and I were trying to have biological family,

860
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,980
 all the dreams that we had in our heart for children.

861
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,380
 I've told this story many times.

862
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,660
 But that was my deepest pain.

863
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,700
 I began to second-guess who I was as a man.

864
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,620
 I began to second-guess who I was as a husband.

865
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,660
 I really struggled with not liking God in that moment,

866
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,380
 feeling like, why did he create me

867
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,900
 with a desire to have a family

868
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,580
 and then make me physically unable to do it?

869
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,340
 Like, is God some joker up in heaven

870
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,260
 who's just having fun playing with my life?

871
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,660
 I was in this place of darkness, deep hurt, and deep pain.

872
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,180
 And in those days, I found it really hard to readjust.

873
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,860
 But I can't even begin to describe to you what it was like

874
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,260
 the moment that my wife and I showed up at Mother's Choice

875
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,800
 and we met Mia, our adopted daughter, for the first time.

876
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,180
 The greatest joy I have ever experienced

877
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,820
 in this little half-Nepalese and half-Indonesian,

878
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,580
 gorgeous little 16-month-old girl.

879
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,300
 And although I thought my family would be built biologically,

880
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,080
 God has built this family through other ways

881
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,300
 that are beautiful and profound.

882
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,300
 And my greatest joy, Mia, has come from my deepest pain.

883
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,860
 And it's a wonderful thing.

884
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:08,940
 Worship and weeping side by side.

885
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,020
 And I love the way that Ezra describes this for us

886
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,260
 in this moment, 'cause I think this is really important.

887
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,260
 Verse 13, "No one could distinguish the sounds

888
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,360
 "of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping

889
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,300
 "because people made such a noise."

890
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,700
 Could you imagine the moment where you're before this rubble

891
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,140
 and everybody is either praising at the top of their voices

892
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,060
 or wailing and weeping at the top of their voices,

893
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,980
 and these things come together in such a way

894
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,540
 that they blend together and create this other kind of sound

895
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,980
 where you can't distinguish between the two.

896
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:45,260
 One of the ways I would describe it to you is this.

897
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,420
 Worship and weeping may be different notes,

898
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,340
 but they are found on the same scale.

899
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,480
 And when they play together, they produce this unexpected

900
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,020
 but profound harmony.

901
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,120
 That is the sound of restoration.

902
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,700
 And could you imagine a community where both weeping

903
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,060
 and worshiping can happen as much as it happens,

904
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,260
 so much that it all blends in together

905
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,060
 so that no one stands out?

906
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,140
 I mean, I don't know if you've ever been

907
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,020
 in one of those church services, maybe here at the Vine,

908
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,380
 where you're standing around and suddenly someone next to you

909
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,660
 starts wailing their eyes out.

910
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,620
 It's like, "Oh, that's awkward.

911
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,100
 "Oh, that's kind of weird.

912
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,560
 "Why is that person doing that?

913
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,460
 "I'm kind of uncomfortable right now."

914
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,420
 Or maybe you come into church here on a Sunday

915
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,020
 and you're feeling like, "Man, that was a tough week.

916
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,280
 "Things are going really bad."

917
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,140
 Maybe you've just had some bad news and you come in,

918
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,260
 and the person you happen to sit next to you

919
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,340
 is the one who's the happiest and the loudest

920
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,180
 in their worship, and you're like,

921
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,540
 "Oh my gosh, Lord, I want to run away."

922
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,980
 When it's just one or two people,

923
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,780
 it stands out and feels awkward for everybody.

924
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,880
 But imagine a community where everyone has permission

925
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,160
 to worship or weep, where everyone can come to church

926
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,980
 with whatever's going on in their lives

927
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,100
 and go, "This is a safe place for me to let it out.

928
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,380
 "This is a safe place for me to put my hand up

929
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,360
 "and say I need prayer.

930
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,400
 "This is a safe place to weep

931
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,240
 "because there's some godly sorrow

932
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,500
 "that I'm wrestling with in my life.

933
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,560
 "This is a safe place to praise as loud as I want.

934
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,020
 "I can do it because everything is happening together,

935
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,540
 "whether in our gatherings like this,

936
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,780
 "in our small groups, no matter how it might happen,

937
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,960
 "there's such a cacophony of worship and weeping

938
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,260
 "that a harmony is created and everybody can grow

939
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,680
 "because they're welcomed, they're safe, they're loved,

940
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,580
 "and they can be just who, in that moment, they are."

941
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,860
 That, my friends,

942
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,340
 that, my friends, is worth a golf clap.

943
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,460
 Nice par.

944
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,800
 That, my friends, is church.

945
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,120
 That's what I want the Lord to read.

946
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,380
 So I'm gonna close with this.

947
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,360
 I'm gonna close with three ways

948
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,340
 that I think we at The Vine can actually invest into this,

949
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,960
 that we can make a space here for restoration and renewal.

950
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,800
 Here it is.

951
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,440
 Number one, we should always treat people around us

952
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,320
 with dignity, respect, and value.

953
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,160
 Can I have an amen?

954
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,980
 - Amen.

955
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,160
 - Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here

956
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,920
 smelling really badly?

957
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,080
 Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here

958
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,880
 really down and depressed and heavy?

959
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,580
 Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here

960
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,260
 with a promotion that week, praising Jesus?

961
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,480
 Like, it's amazing that we can respect people,

962
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,220
 that one who sings really loudly behind you out of tune

963
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,140
 and you wanna turn around and go, "Who are you?"

964
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,260
 Isn't it wonderful that they can be here?

965
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,640
 Isn't it wonderful that the person next to you

966
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,600
 can wail and cry and you not feel awkward about it?

967
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,400
 Isn't it wonderful that you have a senior pastor

968
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,720
 who claps really loudly all the time

969
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,020
 and it really annoys you?

970
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,600
 (congregation laughing)

971
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,440
 Amen?

972
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,980
 - Amen.

973
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,120
 - Isn't it wonderful?

974
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,200
 - It is.

975
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,680
 - That we can be together and be ourselves

976
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,960
 and not have to pretend to be anything else.

977
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,840
 But that will only happen when we feel safe of one another.

978
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,160
 And that will only happen if we give respect

979
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,840
 and dignity and value that every person here

980
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,080
 made in the image of God should demand from you.

981
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,200
 Here's the second thing.

982
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,760
 While our worship should be orderly and respectful,

983
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,360
 Paul writes about that in 1 Corinthians 14,

984
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,600
 we should not expect or force people to believe uniformly.

985
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,040
 We should not expect people to put their hands up

986
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,920
 if they don't want to,

987
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,440
 open their hands if they don't want to,

988
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,600
 sing aloud if they don't want to.

989
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,880
 We should allow space for people to express who they are

990
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,080
 and how they wanna worship in this moment.

991
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,320
 Worship and weeping side by side.

992
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,320
 The worst thing we could do is try to conform people

993
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,160
 to a certain way.

994
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,680
 That doesn't mean we can't have good discipleship,

995
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,740
 we can't have metrics, we can't have culture,

996
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,400
 we have all those things, but our heart is to say,

997
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,360
 we're not trying to conform you to behave in a certain way,

998
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,320
 we're trying for you to feel like you can come in here

999
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,440
 and shake the heavens,

1000
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,300
 and whatever that might mean for you.

1001
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,360
 Here's the third and final thing.

1002
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,920
 Because the God we worship knows us

1003
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,340
 better than we know ourselves,

1004
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,720
 we should not pretend in God's presence.

1005
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,400
 And I think that's something that I think

1006
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,960
 I struggle with sometimes, and I'm sure you do too a bit.

1007
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,240
 I'm just gonna shove that under the carpet,

1008
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,840
 I'm just gonna pretend that that's not there,

1009
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,440
 I'm just gonna like, I don't wanna embarrass myself,

1010
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,880
 I don't wanna stand out.

1011
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,160
 So I'm just gonna put my hands up and sing,

1012
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,080
 but I'm feeling like I need to weep.

1013
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,160
 Or I'm gonna praise, but the people around me

1014
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,600
 seem like they're having a really hard time,

1015
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,120
 so I better just calm down.

1016
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,280
 How beautiful it would be if we realized

1017
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,400
 that in God's presence, because he knows us

1018
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,720
 better than anyone, we don't need to pretend.

1019
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,560
 In his presence is the only place in this world

1020
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,960
 where you are completely free to be who you are.

1021
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,800
 Everywhere else, in your workplace,

1022
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,120
 in your family, in other places,

1023
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,520
 you will find pressure to try to conform to something.

1024
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,960
 You do not need to conform in God's presence

1025
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,240
 to anything other than Jesus Christ.

1026
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,720
 Imagine what that would feel like.

1027
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,120
 That would be a community of transformation,

1028
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,760
 where people could come in here and heal and receive

1029
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,760
 and have promises and forgiveness and life and celebration

1030
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,840
 and together we would become the people

1031
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,480
 that God has called us to be.

1032
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,080
 Takenu osaku, shake the heavens, Lord.

1033
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,760
 Would your power come down and change us, amen?
