1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 Amen. Thank you, Francesca. Let's give Francesca a hand.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,800
 I loved the analogy of, you know, fasting and instead of fast food,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,600
 actually having a quality meal with God and spending time with God.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,600
 And that's really what we believe God is calling us into inter-season.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,560
 You know, it's the commune with Him and to experience Him and just to sit with Him, hear from Him.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,840
 And so, yeah, that was great. Of course, it made me hungry, but that's okay.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,200
 Well, today we're continuing in our sermon series, Fresh Encounters.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,640
 And so, as we were preparing for this, for 2024, as a church family,

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,040
 one of the themes that came up was that need for intimacy,

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,480
 that God wants to do something new, something fresh in our relationship with Him.

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,320
 And so, we designed a sermon series around the fasting.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:12,480
 And there is for every Sunday, we have a topic, a spiritual practice that can help us draw close to God,

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,320
 that can help us encounter Him in fresh ways.

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,760
 And so, I want to share with you what we have planned.

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,520
 So, we've already talked about fasting last week.

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,160
 Today, we're going to look at prayer, then next week, personal worship,

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,680
 then there'll be confession and repentance and God's Word,

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,720
 and how God uses all those five things to draw us near to Him.

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,280
 Now, I also want to say for those of you who perhaps have been a Christian for a while,

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,480
 sometimes you're like, "Oh, I know all this. I know how to read God's Word.

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,440
 I know how to pray." And you might say those things.

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:02:00,800
 But there is a sense that we want to challenge each other to break out of our ruts and out of our routines.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,800
 Because it's easy to have this routine and do the same thing.

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,160
 But Jesus wants to meet us in new ways. He wants to meet us in fresh ways.

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,480
 And so, even though we might be familiar with some of these things or some of these practices,

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
 Jesus wants to do something new and something fresh.

27
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,280
 So, let's ask Him for that, and let's keep challenging each other as we're going through this.

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,360
 You know, we want to encounter Him in fresh ways.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,520
 Now, today, we're looking at the spiritual practice of prayer.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,760
 And there have been, for myself, there's been powerful seasons of prayer,

31
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,200
 where prayer flows for me easily.

32
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:49,040
 And there is just a sense of communing with God and God's presence and God speaking to me,

33
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,720
 and me having clarity on what He's saying and having clarity about His love.

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,400
 And, you know, that's awesome.

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,240
 But if I'm honest, there's also a lot of seasons, and they do come and go.

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,240
 It's not a, you know, you settle this one time, and then you're good,

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,480
 and you just have easy prayer and easy communion with God.

38
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,080
 There's been a lot of seasons for me where it's been difficult to pray.

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,240
 Maybe something difficult was going on in my life, and I felt like I was done with words.

40
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,120
 I already had told God everything.

41
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,400
 You know, I didn't know what else to say.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,840
 Can be many different reasons.

43
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,440
 For whatever reason, prayer did not flow easily.

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,840
 So I don't know where you are on this topic.

45
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,920
 Maybe your prayer life right now is alive and is amazing.

46
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,400
 I mean, Francesca was sharing that she's experiencing a deeper communion with God

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,160
 in this fasting season.

48
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,040
 That is awesome.

49
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
 Praise God.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,720
 But maybe there's actually, right now, you're experiencing challenges,

51
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,240
 and it's hard for you to just to commune with Jesus, to hear from Him, to experience Him.

52
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:17,360
 Now, on a topic like today, it's, of course, in some way, I'm going to encourage you to pray more.

53
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,680
 But if that's the only thing that I'm doing, you already know that.

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,480
 So what I want to do today is actually take a little bit of a different angle.

55
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:33,920
 I want to look with you at how Jesus encourages His disciples to pray,

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,880
 how He encourages them to come to the Father.

57
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:50,800
 And my prayer is that you're encouraged and inspired and moved by the Holy Spirit

58
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,240
 because of what Jesus is saying to draw closer to Him.

59
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,720
 And to commune with Him more in prayer.

60
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:09,360
 Now, before we move further, I actually want to also spend a little bit of time defining what prayer is.

61
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
 So let's look at a definition.

62
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,880
 If you're familiar with Pete Gregg, he is the founder of 24/7 Prayer.

63
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,280
 If you've ever done the prayer course, that's the guy who came up with that.

64
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,680
 And he defines prayer the following way.

65
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,400
 He says this, "Prayer is a living conversation with a loving God,

66
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,680
 which means that we must listen as well as talk."

67
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:40,960
 So prayer, when we spend time with God in prayer, we're not just talking.

68
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,120
 Prayer is not just asking, even though that is an important part of prayer.

69
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,240
 But it's sitting with God quietly.

70
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,560
 It's hearing from Him.

71
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
 It's talking to Him about what's going on.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,240
 It's doing that throughout the day.

73
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
 We can do that when we're busy, when we're at work.

74
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
 We can pray silently in our hearts.

75
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:14,880
 But then it's also important to carve out that extra time where we can have this privacy to really listen.

76
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,600
 And so prayer is a huge topic.

77
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,040
 And today I'm not going to be able to cover everything or say everything on that.

78
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:31,760
 But what I want to do with you is explore how does Jesus encourage His disciples to pray,

79
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,160
 and how might He encourage us through that as well.

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,760
 So we're in the Gospel of Matthew.

81
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,200
 We're one of the most famous sections of Scripture, which is known as the Sermon on the Mount.

82
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,440
 And we're in chapter 7, and starting in verse 7, it says this,

83
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,400
 "Ask, and it will be given to you.

84
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,720
 Seek, and you will find.

85
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,160
 Knock, and the door will be opened to you.

86
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
 For everyone who asks receives.

87
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 The one who seeks finds.

88
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
 And the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

89
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,120
 Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?

90
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,160
 Or if he asks for fish, will give him a snake?

91
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,000
 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,480
 how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him?"

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:38,960
 So first, Jesus here, He encourages us to pray by reminding us of the power of prayer.

94
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,120
 And in verse 7 and 8, He repeats twice, "Ask, seek, knock."

95
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,600
 He's emphasizing that.

96
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,680
 Our prayers really make a difference.

97
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,720
 They really matter.

98
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,240
 God loves when His people come to Him and ask.

99
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,840
 He loves responding to our prayers and working through them.

100
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,360
 He loves it.

101
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:11,280
 And we have a tendency to underestimate that.

102
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,360
 I mean, otherwise, why does Jesus need to encourage the disciples to ask, to seek, to knock?

103
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:26,800
 And if we wouldn't underestimate it, we would actually ask more, knock more, seek more.

104
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:38,960
 Now, for us during the church plan process, we had to ask, because there was no way this could happen.

105
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,800
 And God provided in incredible ways.

106
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,320
 For me, one of the most amazing, and I know I've shared this several times,

107
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,280
 but we were still in one tribe.

108
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,960
 We were figuring out what to do.

109
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:58,320
 We had a barbecue and a one-off Sunday service, and we just really felt God speaking to us

110
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,480
 and showing us that it was time to move to Yuen Long.

111
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,240
 It was time to go to EIS, even though this building was not ready.

112
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,880
 It was not part of our plan, but God spoke, and so we went.

113
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,160
 And it was so good.

114
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,440
 We needed a time.

115
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
 It was amazing.

116
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,600
 Then we had the venue here.

117
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,040
 Sometimes you wait until it's quite late to ask.

118
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,600
 So we suddenly hit a dead end here, where we were not able to move forward with this place.

119
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,280
 You know, I wrote that speech that I was going to present to the church,

120
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,000
 and the implications, oh my gosh, they were weighing on us.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,160
 I go, it's had serious financial implications.

122
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
 So we're asking God for a provision.

123
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,960
 And then he provided a way forward, even though we were told before

124
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,600
 that there was no way we could move forward.

125
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
 God provided.

126
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
 And so this has been part of our journey.

127
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,760
 Right now in this fasting season, we're asking God personally.

128
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,480
 We're asking the Holy Spirit about what he wants to do in our lives.

129
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
 You know, is there a pattern of sin that needs to be broken?

130
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
 Do we need some guidance?

131
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,760
 Is there a decision that we need to make?

132
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,880
 We're coming before God and praying, asking, Lord, speak to us.

133
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
 We want to hear from you.

134
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
 We need you to work in our lives.

135
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,920
 Then, but we're not just asking for ourselves.

136
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,280
 I think this is really important.

137
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,240
 We're also asking for the community.

138
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,280
 That's why we're fasting corporately, because we want to see the kingdom of God

139
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,640
 break into here and now.

140
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,680
 Our heart's prayer is your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

141
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:47,840
 We want to see God's kingdom manifested in you long in the present.

142
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:58,880
 Earlier when we were worshipping, I'm like going to sing, you know, there's power in the name of Jesus.

143
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,440
 You know, Jesus in the streets, I'm getting the lyrics wrong, it's okay.

144
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,600
 But I was like, that's what we're praying for.

145
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,880
 We're praying for Jesus.

146
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,480
 His name is life.

147
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:19,600
 We're praying for people's lives to be turned around, for those who don't know that their

148
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
 love, that their valuable, that their worth.

149
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,200
 I was prayer walking out there by the schools, and I just thought, I'm going to pray for

150
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,240
 people, and I just felt led to pray for the students who don't know that they are loved,

151
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,760
 that they are valuable, that they are worthy.

152
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:50,480
 And the Holy Spirit wants to mobilize us and send us out and encourage and speak these

153
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,080
 truths and love people.

154
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,240
 And so we're crying out, we're asking your kingdom come, your will be done.

155
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,040
 And earth as it is in heaven, that's our hearts cry.

156
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
 We're asking God for that.

157
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,720
 We're knocking, we're seeking.

158
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:14,240
 We're saying not by our own strength, not by our own wisdom, but by your power, by your

159
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,800
 spirit.

160
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,080
 So this is part of what we're doing because we know we cannot do it.

161
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,840
 We cannot do it.

162
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:37,680
 So Jesus's encouragement to ask, seek, and knock highlights our temptation not to ask,

163
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:46,160
 not to seek, not to knock, and to rely on our own strength and our own resources.

164
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
 And we do that all the time.

165
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,520
 I do it all the time.

166
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,480
 I felt as I was preparing this semester, I felt really challenged in that.

167
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,320
 A problem, you know, if something comes up, we go into action mode.

168
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,640
 I like to tackle things.

169
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,600
 I'm proactive and I try to resolve it.

170
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,480
 And then it doesn't work and I try harder and then I try harder.

171
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,440
 And then finally I realized, oh, I could, maybe I should pray.

172
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,880
 Anyone do this?

173
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,160
 Yeah?

174
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,120
 Okay, I'm not the only one.

175
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,360
 Good.

176
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,920
 So then I pray and it's amazing how many times God provides.

177
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,720
 It's amazing.

178
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:32,560
 I, quite a while ago, I lost a watch that my father gave me for my 18th birthday.

179
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,840
 And it was somewhere in my apartment.

180
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,080
 So I was searching for my watch.

181
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:44,880
 And what makes us more special was that he actually had passed away just a little bit

182
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,920
 less than a year prior.

183
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,800
 And so this had, it was like a way I'm trying to remember my dad.

184
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
 And I'm searching like a madman in my house.

185
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,240
 And I'm searching in places where it doesn't even make sense that the watch could possibly

186
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,120
 be there.

187
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,320
 I mean, I literally looked at every inch of my house and I could not find it.

188
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,440
 And I was freaked out because this was so special to me.

189
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:17,680
 And then I prayed and asked Jesus, can you help me find my dad's watch?

190
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,560
 And as I was praying, I remembered that in one of my drawers, there was a crack that

191
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,520
 was quite wide.

192
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,880
 And so I thought, well, maybe it slipped out there.

193
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,480
 So I took the drawer out and there was my father's watch.

194
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,320
 And I know this was the Holy Spirit's guidance.

195
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,800
 I would, why would I think of a crack in my drawer?

196
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,640
 You know?

197
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,600
 And so God, when we ask, when we seek, he loves providing.

198
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,440
 He loves providing.

199
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,680
 But truth be told, our prayers don't always have that quick of an answer or a resolution

200
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,480
 or a provision.

201
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,680
 More times than not, but more times than not, I've experienced God provide.

202
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,200
 This, this watch, it was so precious to me.

203
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,280
 And it was not too small of a thing for God to care about.

204
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,680
 He cares about your details, your personal details in your life.

205
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,680
 And so we can ask him, we can ask.

206
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,800
 I'm also reminded of Archbishop William Temple.

207
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
 He said this, when I pray, coincidences happen.

208
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,640
 When I stop praying, the coincidences stop happening.

209
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:41,200
 In other words, when I ask, seek, and knock, I'm not asking for anything.

210
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,920
 Because when I ask, seek, and knock, there's receiving, there's answers.

211
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,960
 When I don't ask, seek, and knock, nothing happens.

212
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,680
 Now, of course, God is good.

213
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,800
 He blesses us in a lot of ways, but there's certain things he only does when his children

214
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,760
 come to him and ask.

215
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,360
 Now, you might think, well, that's, that's great for you.

216
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,720
 That, that's, that's your experience, Tim.

217
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,800
 This is not for me.

218
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,360
 In verse eight, it says this, for everyone who asks, receives.

219
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,600
 This is not just for pastors.

220
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,960
 This is not for especially spiritual people.

221
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,080
 This is not for people who didn't sin last week.

222
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:38,240
 Everyone who asks, receives.

223
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,200
 God loves you.

224
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,040
 He loves when his children come to him and ask.

225
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:50,560
 He loves giving you things, good things.

226
00:16:50,560 --> 00:17:00,880
 And I wonder, whoever's here today has been intimidated or hesitant to ask God,

227
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,440
 to ask our Heavenly Father, who here has felt this love?

228
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:15,360
 Who here has felt disqualified or not addressed when Jesus says that everyone who asks, receives?

229
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:23,360
 Who here feels right now disqualified or not addressed?

230
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:31,760
 You're not disqualified.

231
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,680
 Jesus loves you.

232
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
 Your Heavenly Father loves you.

233
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,640
 This is for every one of us, not just for some, for every one of us.

234
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,760
 He loves when his children come to him.

235
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:53,920
 Now, at this point, you might be wondering, is it really true that God answers every request we make?

236
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,840
 And this is based on our experience because we've prayed.

237
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,080
 And it seems like there has been no answer, right?

238
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,560
 Come on, let's, let's be honest.

239
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,800
 While it is true that everyone who asks, receives,

240
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,880
 it is not true that everyone receives exactly what they ask for.

241
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,600
 That's a big difference.

242
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,120
 Sometimes God gives us exactly what we request, you know, in the time when we need it, in that moment.

243
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,440
 Amazing, like with my watch, praise God, praise God.

244
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,160
 And other times he gives us something even better.

245
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,200
 Because we don't even sometimes know how to ask for good things for us.

246
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
 He gives us better things.

247
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:44,960
 But then sometimes we also don't receive what we ask for.

248
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,280
 What we still receive.

249
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,080
 Think of Jesus.

250
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,360
 Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, he prayed that this cup can pass,

251
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,960
 which means he was praying that he didn't have to go through the suffering of the cross.

252
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,200
 He prayed to the Father three times.

253
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:13,440
 Now, the Heavenly Father didn't answer Jesus's prayer in by removing the suffering.

254
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,800
 But Jesus did receive from his Father.

255
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 He gave him the grace and the strength to go through the cross and the rise from the dead.

256
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,240
 So everyone who asks receives.

257
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,440
 But we need to come.

258
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
 We need to ask.

259
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,400
 We need to knock.

260
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,960
 We need to search.

261
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,600
 So Jesus encourages us to ask, knock and seek.

262
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,240
 He encourages us, he encourages the disciples by saying everyone who asks receives.

263
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,120
 And this encouragement is really rooted in God's goodness and who God is.

264
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,200
 That he loves you.

265
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,800
 That he's for you, he's not against you.

266
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,160
 That's why we can come.

267
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,840
 That's why we know he will be good to us because our Father is good.

268
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
 That's how Jesus is encouraging us.

269
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,200
 Because God is good.

270
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,520
 He is faithful.

271
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,640
 And he loves you.

272
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,680
 But let's continue looking at our passage.

273
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:37,840
 In verse 9, starting verse 9 says this, "Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?

274
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,480
 Or if he asks for fish, will give him a snake?

275
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,400
 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,

276
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,960
 how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him?"

277
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:02,160
 So Jesus draws on this everyday experience that we have.

278
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,040
 And you can even have this experience here because there's lots of children here

279
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,200
 that come to their parents and they ask for things.

280
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,480
 Parents love giving good things to their children.

281
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,520
 And it says, "Though while we are evil," this is talking about our sinfulness, our brokenness of all humanity.

282
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,400
 You know, we're selfish, there's just things in our hearts.

283
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,920
 And even as parents, we're broken parents.

284
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,320
 But despite of that, we still give good things to our children.

285
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:40,960
 And then Jesus says, "How much more?"

286
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,960
 Because God is perfect, our Heavenly Father is perfect.

287
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,080
 How much more will he give you good things to those who ask?

288
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,760
 How much more?

289
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:05,360
 Now I was thinking of, if when I was a child, if I would have had the option

290
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,120
 with my parent in a superstore, not super, it might have been a superstore, a supermarket,

291
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
 and I could have picked what's for dinner.

292
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,800
 Chances are, I would have picked like 10 Snickers or something that's not good for me.

293
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,880
 Or whatever I was in the mood for at the time.

294
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,040
 Now good parents, maybe they let you have one of those candy bars,

295
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
 but then there's a point where they're going to say no.

296
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,640
 But they give good things.

297
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
 You know, our Father in heaven, we come to him,

298
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
 he has the big picture.

299
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
 We don't have the big picture of our lives in mind.

300
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,880
 We don't.

301
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,960
 But God knows everything.

302
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,840
 And so when we come to him and ask, we have the promise that he will give us good things.

303
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,960
 The things that are in line with his will, align with his purpose.

304
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,920
 And one of the things that I love right now is that we're praying for our community.

305
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,160
 God loves that because we're praying for good things.

306
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:23,440
 We're praying for God to just pour out his love, to pour his provision on the people around us.

307
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,400
 God loves answering those prayers.

308
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,440
 God loves also answering our prayers when we as children come to our heavenly Father.

309
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,440
 Now I want to highlight that Jesus refers to God as your Father in heaven, your Father.

310
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:49,680
 And since God is our Father, it means that we have been adopted as his children into his family.

311
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:57,520
 And he's already made us the greatest gift of all,

312
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,320
 which is the gift of salvation.

313
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,840
 He has forgiven us our sins, he has brought us in as his sons, his daughters, his children.

314
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,720
 And if he's already made you the greatest gift, and you come to your Father and you ask him,

315
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,920
 he is for you, he loves you, he's not going to withhold good things from you.

316
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,280
 And Jesus wants his disciples to know this.

317
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,400
 And so he encourages them to come to their loving heavenly Father.

318
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,920
 He loves you, he loves you.

319
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:46,000
 And so we come as children to our Father in prayer.

320
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,520
 Now one thing, this passage does focus a lot on asking.

321
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,320
 But I really, as I was preparing for this message, I did have a strong sense that some of our fresh

322
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:09,360
 encounter is really just growing in this father-child relationship for us, of getting to know

323
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,600
 God as our loving, perfect Father.

324
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,880
 I know our human fathers, a lot of times, were not, are not perfect.

325
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,720
 But God is perfect.

326
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,880
 And he wants us to learn to relate to him as a child relates to the Father.

327
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,400
 You don't have to be hesitant when you're a child to come to your dad.

328
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:40,240
 You can just come and be and ask and spend time and tell your father about the day and what has

329
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,640
 happened.

330
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:54,240
 Now for me, when I was a young adult, there was a lot of guilt, shame, pain in my life.

331
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,720
 And my, even though I was a Christian, my relationship with God was not one of a child

332
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,600
 with a father, with a loving heavenly Father.

333
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:10,640
 Felt maybe a little bit more like coming to your business manager, your boss or something.

334
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:21,840
 I didn't, I didn't feel like I was adequate because I knew, I knew my life.

335
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,920
 It was so much just shame and sin.

336
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:33,120
 And I felt like I could not come to my heavenly Father.

337
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,320
 I didn't feel like I always had access.

338
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,720
 And then I had this powerful experience where somebody was teaching on who God is and how

339
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,920
 he loves us.

340
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
 And then there was a prayer time afterwards.

341
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,680
 And first I was sitting and later on I was on the floor weeping.

342
00:26:51,680 --> 00:27:00,720
 But it's been one of the most healing moments of my life where God revealed himself to me

343
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,560
 as the loving Father.

344
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:12,400
 And this pain, this shame, this guilt, it started melting away in the presence of God.

345
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,160
 I was communing with my loving dad.

346
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,320
 Now this is revelation.

347
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,600
 This is the Holy Spirit's work revealing God to us in this way.

348
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,120
 But I have a sense that some of us need this revelation.

349
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,040
 God wants to reveal himself as the Father who loves you.

350
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,160
 So Jesus encourages us to come to him, to come to our heavenly Father, to bring anything

351
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:59,360
 that's going on in our lives to him, pour our hearts to him, to receive his love, his

352
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,760
 care, his goodness, his provision.

353
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,760
 To bring our requests and experience how he meets us.

354
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:19,120
 So we've seen that Jesus encourages his disciples to ask, not seek.

355
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,120
 We've seen that he encourages us to come like a child, to come to the Father.

356
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,040
 And I wonder how is Jesus encouraging us here today to come to him?

357
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:37,120
 How is Jesus encouraging us here today for a fresh encounter with him in prayer?

358
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,960
 How is he inviting you to experiencing him a new way?

359
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,440
 What is the rut he might be inviting you to break out of?

360
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,360
 Out of what routine is he calling you to break out?

361
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,760
 Well, perhaps for some of us, this means instead of relying on our own resources and our own

362
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,800
 strengths, and that being our first thing that we do, we get in the action mode, we

363
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,920
 try to resolve things.

364
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,920
 That's my default.

365
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:18,240
 But actually, I wonder what would happen if we bring more of our daily life in the conversation

366
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,040
 with our heavenly Father?

367
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:25,040
 What if we just start by bringing those things to God instead of first just trying to resolve

368
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,120
 everything and until we hit a wall and then come to him?

369
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,240
 I really felt Jesus challenged me to flip this around, to not only come when I'm at

370
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,520
 a dead end, but already beforehand be talking to him and asking and seeking and knocking.

371
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,320
 So perhaps that is a fresh way that God is also inviting you to relate to him.

372
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:51,280
 Or for others of us, God is inviting us to come to him in prayer as a child comes to

373
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,920
 the Father.

374
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:58,960
 We're children of God, but often relate to God as a business manager who does not have

375
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,280
 time for us, who's too busy, who doesn't want to be bothered.

376
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,160
 You have his attention.

377
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,960
 He has time for you to spare.

378
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,840
 He loves when you come to him.

379
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,440
 He delights in you.

380
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:25,200
 And when we get to know God as our loving Father, we start to experience wholeness,

381
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
 peace, security.

382
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:38,320
 So how is God inviting you to renew, to refresh your prayer life?

383
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,000
 Now I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.

384
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,920
 And what I want to invite you to do is actually it's something we do quite often at the Vine,

385
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,360
 whether in Monshire here, is we want to pray with each other.

386
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,720
 So whether you pray with somebody you came with, you know, maybe there's somebody close

387
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
 to you and you just ask, "Hey, would you be cool that we can pray together?"

388
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,520
 I want to encourage you to pray with each other, to pray for your prayer life, to pray

389
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,440
 you can share how you need prayer and just to minister to each other, just to come to

390
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,960
 our heavenly Father in prayer.

391
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:24,160
 So we're going to do this for five to seven minutes, and then I'll bring us back together.

392
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,360
 So let's, yeah, let's do that right now.

393
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,720
 So let's turn to each other.

394
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,760
 Let's pray for each other.

395
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,560
 The prayer team will also be up here.

396
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,680
 If you would like somebody to minister to you in prayer, you can come to them.

397
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,120
 We would love to pray with you as well.

398
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360

 (soft piano music)

491
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
 thank you that you love us.

 (soft piano music)

493
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,480
 Thank you for all the prayers being lifted up to you,

494
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
 that you hear us,

495
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
 that you love answering our prayers,

496
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,480
 that you love meeting us, providing for us, caring for us.

497
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,480
 Lord, I pray for deeper revelations of who you are.

 (soft piano music)

499
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,400

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,400
 when you feel like we don't deserve to be close to you,

501
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,400
 I pray that you remove those lies,

502
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,400
 that your love breaks through whatever walls have been built up.

503
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
 Whatever walls have been built up,

504
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,400
 I pray right now in Jesus' name that you tear them down.

505
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:31,400
 Jesus, through your sacrifice, we have access.

506
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,320
 We have access to the Father anywhere, anytime.

507
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:44,320
 And so, Lord, I ask that this year

508
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
 that you would do something new in us,

509
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,320
 in us as a community, in our personal lives,

510
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,320
 that you grow us deeper in prayer,

511
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
 deeper in communing with you.

512
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,320
 I pray for a new work,

513
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,320
 and we know that's you.

514
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,320
 We can't force that. We can do it.

515
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
 It's your work.

516
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,320
 It's the Holy Spirit we ask for you to work in this way.

517
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,320
 I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.

518
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
 (congregation murmurs)

519
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,320
 Why don't we all stand and let's worship?

520
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:24,320
