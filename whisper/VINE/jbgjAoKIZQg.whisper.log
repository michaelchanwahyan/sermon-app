[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   So, Merry Christmas by the way.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Merry Christmas by the way.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   All right, good.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   So, when I was a kid, and we got lots of kids with us today.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   When I was a kid, my greatest passion was skateboarding.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Okay?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   I grew up in the 80s.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Anybody else grew up in the 80s?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Come on, let's hear it.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Loud and proud 80s people.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   My buddy.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Are you sure?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   No, just kidding, I know you're 80s.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   All right.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   I grew up in the 80s, and skateboarding was a thing, massive in the 80s.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So, I remember when I first saw somebody skateboarding.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I was watching a surfing video with a friend in the mid 80s.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And this surfer, on the off season, would take his surfboard,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   and he would get a pair of roller skates,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   and he would nail the roller skates under the surfboard,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   so he could surf down the street to practice his surf moves
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   when the waves weren't happening.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And I thought to myself, I live in a city filled with concrete.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I grew up here in Hong Kong, and I was like,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   if this is the place to skateboard, surely this is the place.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   We don't get many waves in the ocean,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   but we have a lot of concrete that we could ride in.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And from that moment of watching the surfer surf on his makeshift skateboard,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I convinced myself that all I wanted for Christmas was a skateboard.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So I said to my parents, I really, really want a skateboard.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   So on Christmas morning, 1988, I got my very first skateboard.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yes! Let me show you a photo of it.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   There it is. On the right-hand side was my skateboard.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It was a Tony Hawk model. That's me!
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Okay, that's me trying to pretend like I'm flying in the air,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   doing a skateboard trick, but I'm actually just kneeling on the ground.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   But that's me in the 80s. That was my skateboard.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   This skateboard that you can see me holding is also mine.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I brought this when I turned 40 because I had a midlife crisis
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   and could not afford a motorbike.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So I brought myself a skateboard, and I started skating again when I turned 40.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   In the 80s, though, skateboarding was a thing,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and I spent every single moment of my free time skateboarding.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   We built up a skate group in the neighborhood where I was living,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and it was amazing.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I actually became quite good at the skateboard.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   In fact, good enough that I could skateboard down the road
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and skateboard between cars.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   On one particular day, I was doing that down Braemar Hill
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   because it was a really big slope, a big hill up there,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and I was skating between all the cars on the road,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and suddenly I hear a police siren,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   and a motorbike policeman pulls me over,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and he takes me to the side.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   He asks for my ID card. I'm like 15 years old.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I give him my ID card, and he picks up my skateboard.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   He's like, "Hmm."
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   He's like, "You are very talented on this thing."
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I was like, "Thank you, Mr. Police Officer."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Am I so talented that I'm not going to get fined?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And he's like, "It's illegal to skateboard on the road in Hong Kong."
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I'm like, "Yeah, I kind of know."
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And he's like, "Do not do it again."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And then he let me go. It was awesome.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Because you know that the legend status of any skateboarder
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   goes to 100 million if they've been pulled over by the police.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Because that's what every skateboarder wants,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   is a story of being arrested by the police.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So my legendary status in the neighbourhood just rose.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Now, one particular day,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   a new kid showed up in our neighbourhood with a skateboard.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Now, we had a pretty tight group of friends.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We were like a family together.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   We thought we were the cool kids of the neighbourhood.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And this other kid shows up with his own skateboard.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And I was like, "Who's this joker?"
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Can he join our cool club of skateboarders?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Does he skateboard well?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And as we're trying to chat with him and get to know him,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   he goes, "Let me show you what my dad made for me."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And he showed us a skate ramp that his dad had made for him.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Coolest dad in the world.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Made him this skate ramp.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And it was about our head height.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   When I was about 15, I might have been about this high or so.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And the skate ramp was that big.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It was a big slope that came up.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And the whole idea was you would skate up to the ramp
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and try and launch off the other end and do a trick,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   just like the one that I'm pretending to do right there.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   That was the whole thing.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So he showed us this skate ramp.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And all of us, all of us as part of the skate gang,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   were terrified of skate ramps.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Because we had never skated on a ramp before.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Here in Hong Kong now, you actually have skate parks and skate ramps.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Back in my day, in the 80s, there were no skate parks,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   no skate ramps in Hong Kong.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   This guy had a ramp.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It was super cool.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   But we were terrified of it.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Now I realized that I wanted to make a deep connection with this guy.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I wanted him to feel at home in our skate gang.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And I'm a very EQ-orientated person.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Not particularly IQ, but quite EQ.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Like I feel people's emotions,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and I want people to feel safe and happy all the time.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And so I could see him showing off his proud skate ramp
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   that none of us wanted to skate on.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And I wanted to take a risk in order to connect with him.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   In order to make him feel like he's welcomed into our family.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I was willing to give the skate ramp a go
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   in order that he might feel welcomed into our gang.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It was the dumbest idea I have ever made.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So I decided I went right back as far away from the ramp as I could.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I didn't have a helmet.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   We didn't have any knee pads.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   No safety gear whatsoever.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   The skate ramp was about 20 yards ahead of me.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I had my skate like this.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And I was like, "Go!"
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And I skated as fast as I could.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Jumped up on my board.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I'm going like super fast.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I'm coming up to the skate ramp.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I hit the skate ramp.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And then everything went wrong.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I hit the skate ramp.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And my skate goes all the way up in the air.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It starts spiraling.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   It flies massively there.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I'm literally in the air, turning around, without a helmet,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   about to land face first onto the ramp.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I landed face first onto the ramp.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I then slid all the way down the ramp.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And I had so much momentum that I then skidded on the concrete.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And my arm was behind me as I was skidding on the concrete.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And my skin of my arm was so dragged like this
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   that the skin here came onto my elbow,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   bore a hole in it, almost all the way down to the bone.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Blood is going everywhere.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It's the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   This new kid, feeling probably guilty about the ramp,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   runs over to me to see if I'm okay.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And I'm lying on the ground.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   By the way, I've still got a scar here.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   You can come later and I'll show it to you in real life, right?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I'm lying there.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I've got like tears in my eye.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Blood's coming from my arm.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I am overwhelmed.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   He stands over me.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And as our eyes lock, there's this pregnant pause between us.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And then he says this,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   "That was awesome! You're awesome!"
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And I was like, "It was awesome! It was so good!"
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   We became best friends forever.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   After that day, even my pain and my sacrifice,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   to welcome him into the family,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   we were inseparable after that.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And we were like the best mates for years.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   We skated together, had a lot of fun together.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I never went near the ramp ever again.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Now I wonder if you could think about the themes of risk,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   of valuing somebody,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   of doing everything you can to make them feel like
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   you're a part of the family.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Those themes, although they don't get talked a lot about at Christmas time,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   are actually the central themes of Christmas Day,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   the day that we gather here together to celebrate.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   It's the central idea of what Christmas Day is all about,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   the reality that Jesus has come.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And when John, the gospel writer,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   wants to write a little bit about the arrival of Jesus,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   the birth of Jesus.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Now you'll know if you know the Bible well,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   that really only Matthew and Luke include details about Jesus' birth.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   So most of the time at Christmas,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   we sit in either Matthew or Luke.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   But maybe you didn't know that John actually mentions also
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   the birth of Jesus right at the beginning of his gospel.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And when he does, he's trying to pull on the themes of risk,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and connection, and intimacy,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   in explaining what happened on the day that we're celebrating today.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I want to make sure I don't trip on my skateboard and break my neck.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Let me read to you John chapter 1,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   and just a few verses where John mentions the birth of Jesus.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Starting in verse 12.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   It says, "Yet to all who received him,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   to those who have believed in his name,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   he gave the right to become children of God.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Children born not of descent,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   nor of human decision or a husband's will,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   but born of God.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So the Word became flesh,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   and made his dwelling among us.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   We have seen his glory,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   the glory of the one and only,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   who came from the Father,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   full of grace and truth."
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   John writes here, and he says,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   you need to understand something about the Christmas day.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   About the moment that Jesus came into the world.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And he describes it like this.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   The Word, speaking of Jesus,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   and he's just spent the early part of this chapter explaining the Word.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   The Word was there at the beginning,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   and the Word was mighty and glorious.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   The Word was the light to the world,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   but the world didn't understand it.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   All of this beautiful stuff.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   But then he says, guess what?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   This Word didn't stay distant from us,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   but the Word took flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   The word dwelling there means to make a home amongst us.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's like literally God decided,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I don't want heaven anymore to be my home.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I want the earth to be my home.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And it's almost like God was like,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   how can I take a risk to show how much I value connecting with humanity?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   You see, the incarnation was an incredible risk.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Think about it from the perspective of God.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   He had every power in all of the universe.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And in order to show us his love,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and to welcome us into relationship with him,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   he was willing to give up all of that power
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   and be found microscopic embryo in Mary.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   All the power of heaven dwindled to the infancy of a child.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   The incarnation is God's way of saying,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I so value you that I'm going to move into your neighborhood
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   so that you can move into my neighborhood.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I so value you that I'm willing to take a risk
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   so that you could come and know me.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   A little bit like how I was willing to take a risk on that day
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   to try out that skate ramp because I wanted that kid
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   to feel like he was a part of the club.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Jesus looks down on the earth,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   looks down on broken humanity,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   and so longs to be in intimacy with one of us
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   that he was willing to become one of us.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So desiring to be in intimate relationship with you
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   that he was willing to actually become like you.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   So put on eyebrows and a saliva gland and a spleen
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   and move into your neighborhood
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   so that he might connect with you.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Might say, hey, I'm here with you.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Might help you to know that there is a God
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   that's willing to dwindle himself down to human level
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   so that we might have a God that we could know personally.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I mean, that's the beauty and the wonder
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   of why we gather here today.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And as a parent myself, I've experienced this kind of love
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   that I think drove God to send his son on Christmas day.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   This love that says, I will do whatever it takes
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   to connect with you.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Whatever it takes to be like you.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Your interest will become my interest.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Your pain will be like my pain.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   I will absorb it all together so that you can know me.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   As a parent, I've come to experience that.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Chris and I adopted our daughter Mia,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   who's sitting right here,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   and it's gonna be incredibly embarrassed,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   but I love you, baby.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   We adopted her when she was like 16 months old,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   and now she's 12,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   and she's turning into this incredible woman.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And throughout her whole life,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I've done everything I can to connect with her
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   and to show her that love.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   And that means having her passions become my passions.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   The things that she loves become the things that I love.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I've even gotten to the point
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   where I'm listening to Blackpink.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Yes!
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   And I tell you, throughout our relationship,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   man, we've had some great times.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   I've become Mia's mannequin for putting makeup on
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   so she could practice how to put makeup on.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Okay, I've won pretty dresses
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   so that Mia would also wear pretty dresses alongside of me.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   We've done dance-offs to '80s music all the time,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   and she always wins.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I've had my nails painted,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   both my fingernails and my toenails painted so many times,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   I cannot count them.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And guess what?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   That paint stays on for weeks.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   There have been so many sermons
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   that I have preached with pink toenails
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   that you had no idea about
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   because Mia had painted my nails.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Her interests become my interests,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and that's my way of showing my love for her.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And that's Christmas morning.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   That's why we're gathered here,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   because God decided that your interests were his interests.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Your pain would become his pain.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Your joy would be his joy
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   because he wants you to be in relationship with him.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   He wants you to know him, and love drove it for him.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   This is why John, when he's trying to capture this idea for his people,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   he says this in verse 12.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   He says, "Yet all who received him,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   to those who believed in him,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   he gave the right to become the children of God."
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   See, the whole purpose of the incarnation,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   the whole reason why Jesus came down on this day that we celebrate
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   is so that we would then be welcomed into his family.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Like my friend in that skateboard that day with the ramp
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   who became a part of our gang,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Jesus comes so that we might be invited into his family,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   so that we would become children of God.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   How does that process happen?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Well, John explains it.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   He says, "For all, first of all, who have received him."
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   It's a powerful statement.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   This is Christmas day where all have received Jesus.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Whether you're a Christian or not, you have received Jesus.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Jesus has come.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   It's a historical fact that Mary and Joseph gave birth to a child
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   who had become known as Jesus.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   It's a historical fact that he lived in Galilee
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   and travelled there and taught there.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It's a historical fact that he was killed by the Roman Empire.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   This is Jesus who has come to us.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   In other words, everybody has received him,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   and that's the wonder of Christmas.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   That's the connection point of Christmas.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And whether you're a Christian in this room or not,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   maybe someone's invited you today.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Maybe the Christian faith is not something you're necessarily interested in,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   but you're here because you wanted to connect with the interests of somebody you love.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Good job, see? You're being more Christian than you realize.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   There you go.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Your daughter or your son invited you to church today,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   and you decided to come.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Or maybe your parents invited you to come today,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   and you decided to come.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   All of that is because the world has received Jesus.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   But receiving Jesus is not enough.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   It's interesting that Christmas is actually more than that,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   because John then goes on to say this,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   "For all who have received him, to those that have believed in his name."
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   You see, there are two elements that he's trying to point out to us.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   There is the beauty and the wonder of Christmas Day
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   where all people in the world, whether they're Christian or not,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   have received Jesus.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   But yet something else happens.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Something else happens for some of us
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   when we come into knowing who Jesus is.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   We come to actually believe that he was more than just a child that was born in the stable,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   more than just a man who taught some good moral ethics to people in Galilee,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   more than somebody who was murdered on a cross just by the Roman Empire,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   that actually this Jesus was the Son of God.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   That actually this Jesus carries our sin and brokenness on his shoulders.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   That this Jesus in his resurrection means that we now have eternal life in him
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   by grace and by his forgiveness.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   You see, Christmas is not just about receiving Jesus.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Christmas is also about believing in Jesus.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Those two things go side by side,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   but they're not always things that happen together.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And I think so often the world, and so often I would even argue this,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Christians have just received Jesus, but don't actually believe in him.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Don't actually believe that he can do the things that he did.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Don't actually believe that the promises of the Bible are true.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Don't actually believe that those promises can happen and work in their lives.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Don't actually believe that the Spirit of God could transform a society they have received,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   but they don't fully believe.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Are you with me?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   My grandfather was the most interesting man when it came to Christmas.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   When you would give my grandfather a present from under the Christmas tree, a wrapped present,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   he would take that present, and here's what my grandfather would do.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   He would squeeze it with his hands for a bit,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   and then he would announce what he thought the present was.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   So he'd be like, "Oh, thank you for my present."
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   "Pair of socks."
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And then he'd put it down by the side without opening it.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And then you'd give him another present, and he'd be like, "Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   "Oh, box of chocolates. Thanks so much."
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And he'd put it down on the side here.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   The scary thing was he was right 100% of the time.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   I don't know how he did it, but it was kind of scary.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   But you see, John's trying to communicate something here.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   He's saying it's not just about receiving Jesus.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   It's also about believing Him.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And if you just receive Him without believing in Him,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   it's like you've been given the greatest gift that has ever been given,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   wrapped in the wonder of humanity,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   and you have refused to open it and encounter it.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   You've just, like my grandfather, taken a guess and put it down to the side
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   and moved on with your life.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And if Christmas is anything, it's an invitation
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   into not just knowing that Jesus was born on this day,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   but actually changing your life in believing in Him
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   so that your life would be forgiven of your sin,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   that your life would be changed forever,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   so that you would have eternal presence with Him in this world.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   That's the beauty of Christmas.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   It's not a present wrapped that sits on the mantelpiece
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   that you look at once a year.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   It's something to be open daily in that encounter of relationship with Him.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   So think of the threads of what Christmas Day is all about.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   The risk that God had to come down to earth and be with us.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   The willingness for Him to suffer and to hurt a little bit
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   so that we would come to know Him.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   The beauty of Him getting involved in our interests
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   so that we might be then invited into His family.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   That's what then John says right here at the end.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   He says, "So that we would become children of God."
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   There it is, part of His family.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   No longer orphans to sin, but children of God.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Part of His life, part of who He is.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   In connection with Him, He's moved into our neighborhood
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   so that we can move into His neighborhood,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   so that we can be swept up in His family.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Like my skateboard friend who became a part of our gang,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Jesus comes just in the flesh for you,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   shows His likeness to you,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   becomes interested in you,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   driven by love for you,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   so that you would then be a part of His family.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Welcomed into the comfort and the safety and the security of eternal life.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   What a beautiful thing we celebrate here on Christmas morning.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Every year, the department store in the UK, John Lewis,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   produces a Christmas small short film.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Now, on most years, the film is really designed to help
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   to advertise all of the stuff that they sell.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   But this year, in the film that they produce,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   they actually changed it a little bit
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   and focused on their philanthropy work,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   the work that they do for the NGOs that they support.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And this year in particular,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   they wanted to highlight the issue in the UK
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   of children that are stuck in the foster care system
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   and are institutionalised,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   and how families in the UK should open their homes
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   to accept these children in.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And although their ad was designed to kind of speak about a philanthropic,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   is that the word, philanthropic? Whatever.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Some sort of charitable focus to it,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   actually the film contains the true, full message
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   of the incarnation of Jesus.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And as we watch this film now, I wonder whether also
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   you might notice some of the other things
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   that I've been talking about with you this morning.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Let's take a look at the film.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Yeah, we can't wait.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   We've got a piece.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   We're really excited.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Merry Christmas.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   You OK?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Yeah, I'm fine.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   How did it go?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Are they on there?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   They're coming.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Hey, Ellie.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Hi.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I skate a bit too.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   You want to come in?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Oh, it's cool.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Not as good as yours, I don't think.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Oh, well, I'll just have a few stickers, asshole.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   I'm going to get some stickers for you.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   So, like a potential foster dad
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   who's willing to have a few injuries
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   in order to show an interest to a child
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   so that child would be welcomed
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   and feel comfortable and safe in their family.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   So, God, looking upon broken humanity,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   looking upon the orphans of us all,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   wanting to welcome us into his family,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   decides a little risk is worth it.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And then the incarnation comes to us, like us,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   so that we ultimately would be welcomed into his family,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   so that we would be comfortable and safe in his presence.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   The beauty of Christmas morning
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   is this incredible heart of love that God has,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   a heart that he has for every single person in this room,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   a desire that he is willing to do whatever it takes
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   so that you would feel at home with him.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   My prayer for you on Christmas morning
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   is that you would know that God,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   that you would come to experience
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   the incarnation for you personally,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   that you would know that there is a Father in heaven
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   who's willing to do whatever it takes
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   so that you would be a child of God.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   I wonder whether we could pray together.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Let's pray.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Father, I'm so grateful for everybody here,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   for those online that are watching in this time,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   for those in this room here.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Thank you, Lord, for these incredible children of God of yours.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Lord, we thank you for the challenge today
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   to not just receive you, but to believe in you.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   We thank you that through believing in you,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   we become your children.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   We thank you that you have done everything on our behalf.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Like that father in the film
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   who was willing to learn something,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   you were willing to
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   devoid yourself of all of your power
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   in order to be born a helpless, vulnerable child
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   in a cave in Bethlehem
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   so that we might know you,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   so that we might be safe in your family.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And whilst we're praying,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   if you're here in this room,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   maybe you're not a Christian here,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   and you've been invited to be here today,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   I want to just pray for you
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   and just give you a chance today
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   to make the best decision you'll ever make.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   You know, that foster child on the outside of the door
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   had the choice.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   No one was forcing her to come into this new family,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   but the foster father made it a welcoming place for her.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Jesus has made his home a welcoming place for you.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   But like that foster child, the choice is yours.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Do you step into his family,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   or do you stay on the outside?
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   The door is open.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Jesus said, "Anybody who knocks on my door,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I will open it, and they can come in and be with me."
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   And so perhaps here today on Christmas morning, 2022,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   that's the decision you want to make in your heart.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   You want to say, "I want to be a part of that family.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I'm so grateful that God revealed himself
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   in the incarnation, Jesus, for me."
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And that's a really simple thing for you to do today.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   The way you step into his home
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   is just through a simple prayer.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It's just to say this in your heart,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   "Father, I believe in you.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I don't just receive you.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   I may not have all my questions answered,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   but I believe in you today.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And I ask you to forgive me of the things that I've done
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   that have hurt you and hurt me and hurt others.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And I thank you that you have forgiven me.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   And will you now come and be with me,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   be in me by your Spirit?"
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   So that prayer of, "I believe in you.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Would you forgive me for things?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   And would you come and be a part of my life?"
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   That's the prayer that brings you
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   on the threshold into the home.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And perhaps today that's a prayer you want to make.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And so in the quietness of your heart,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   you can make that prayer today.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   I want to encourage you that when you make that prayer,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   just share it with somebody.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Maybe with the person who's invited you to be here today.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   You can let them know,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   "Hey, I prayed that prayer that Pastor Andrew asked me to pray."
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And that way they can have a chat with you a little bit more.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Or you can come and let us know after the service
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   and we will chat with you too
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   and let you know a little bit more
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   about what it is to live an amazing life
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   with Christ Jesus.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   But I also want to pray for those in this room
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   who are Christian already.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   And you're here on Christmas Day
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   and you probably came in today saying,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   "I've heard a thousand Christmas Day messages."
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   But you're here today and I believe the Holy Spirit
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   is challenging you for deeper intimacy in 2023.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   I believe that Jesus wants to get to know you even more
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and you Him.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   And maybe your prayer on Christmas morning is,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   "Lord, I want to have a deeper connection with you.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Lord, I want to have your interests as my interests.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   I want to see this world as you see it.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   I want to see Hong Kong and my family
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   and my workplace as you see them.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Lord, I want to know your heart.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   I want to know your passion.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   I want to know the mission that you have for me
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   and for this world.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I want to be a part of a bigger story than just my own."
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   And maybe 2023 for you as a Christian
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   is about taking that next step
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   in your discipleship with Jesus.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   So whatever it might be for you,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   we pray now that God here on Christmas Day
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   would meet you and speak to you,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   love you, revive you, and welcome you again into His family.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Would you stand with me?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And we're gonna respond together in a closing song of worship.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And worship is so important on Christmas Day.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   It's a way of us just expressing our adoration
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   and our love of God.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.400]   So let's do that together as a family.
