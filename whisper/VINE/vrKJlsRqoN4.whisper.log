[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.040]   - Thank you.
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.200]   - Isn't he amazing?
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.980]   Thank you, Leslie.
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.120]   How's everyone doing?
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.400]   Weather's finally changing.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.920]   Are you enjoying it so far?
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.080]   I love the weather this week.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.400]   That I have to put on something extra to tell you
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.280]   I'm really enjoying it.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.480]   So on Wednesday night, I remember after Alpha,
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.500]   I was leaving the building on my way to the bus stop
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.920]   and I was like, "Oh, that's awesome!"
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.560]   I missed it!
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.300]   To a point that when I reached the bus stop,
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.300]   I actually have to take out my phone,
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.660]   took a picture, put it on Instagram immediately,
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.240]   on stories and say, "I love the weather."
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.020]   I hope you're enjoying it because we don't get this a lot.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.480]   Weather has been pretty hot, humid, terrible
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.360]   in the last couple of weeks, years, months, I don't know.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.640]   And I was actually Googling, not Googling,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.800]   I first saw this on IG a couple days ago.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.840]   It says that this mid-autumn, two weeks ago,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.440]   it was the hottest mid-autumn ever
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.680]   in the history of Hong Kong.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.960]   So I really, I saw it on the news, I didn't make this up.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.880]   Hong Kong sees hottest mid-autumn festival
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.440]   since records began in 1884.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.100]   And I actually continued to do a little bit of digging
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.120]   and mainly I was searching Chinese news,
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.480]   which I don't have it here,
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.240]   but I'll show it to the Chinese congregation.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.160]   I found out that last year, 2023,
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160]   it was also a record-breaking hottest autumn last year.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.280]   And then I continued to dig and realized in 2019,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.760]   it was then also the record-breaking highest temperature,
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.240]   hottest autumn ever.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.040]   So we had three record breakers in the last five years
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.920]   when it comes to how hot it's been.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.400]   Isn't it crazy?
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.360]   So I know, I know that, I know there's a debate out there
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.360]   whether global warming is fake news or not,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.240]   I really know that.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.760]   But like whenever I go out,
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.080]   whenever I sit in a house without turning on the air con,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.120]   I know, like I'm so convinced that global warming,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.240]   it's quite real.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.800]   That heat is just unbearable.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.680]   The thing about global warming is this,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.360]   I grew up in a church here in Hong Kong.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.360]   For 99% of the church meetings or services I've been to,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.440]   whenever the topic global warming was brought up,
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.280]   99%, the implication was always the same.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.440]   Jesus is coming back, it's the end times, the end is near.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.800]   Come on guys, repent and go and preach the gospel.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.880]   I don't know about you,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.320]   but I grew up in this part of the world
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.520]   and in this part of the world, in the church,
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.960]   99%, when we talk about global warming,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.040]   we talk about the end times,
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.080]   we talk about Jesus coming back,
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.160]   so you should go out and preach the gospel.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.160]   And yes, I do agree that there is an urgency of evangelism.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.480]   But as you know, as much as we love evangelism
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.600]   here in this church,
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.160]   and by the way, Alpha on Tuesday and Wednesday,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.120]   that's our expression of evangelism,
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.160]   and it's just the second week, or third week this week,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.400]   so there is still time to bring friends.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.640]   Okay, advertisement done.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.860]   But as much as we love evangelism in this church,
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.060]   as we are wrapping up the Justice series,
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.820]   I do want to allow me to share from another perspective.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.500]   You know, in the last couple of weeks,
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.520]   we actually explore four different spheres of relationship.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.320]   We have that slide from Pastor Tim, I brought it back again.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.540]   We talk about different, the four sphere of relationships,
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.540]   us with God, with ourselves, with others, and with creation.
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.820]   And we talked a little bit about the other three,
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.060]   God, ourselves, and others.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.500]   And so today, we are gonna close the series
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.860]   with talking about our relationship with creation.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.260]   And in the whole sermon series,
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.060]   we've been talking about how God
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.820]   originally designed these four relationships,
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.260]   or spheres of relationships,
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.500]   so that we could enjoy or experience shalom
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.980]   in these contexts.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.420]   But tragically, humanity, we decided to rebel against God
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.260]   and sin against God, and consequently,
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.940]   we suffered from the disruption
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.720]   of all these four different relationships.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.180]   Remember, Pastor Tim, he got like something,
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.820]   yeah, he drew on that, yeah.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.540]   Oh, yes, yes.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.380]   So you probably remember that.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.420]   So we talked about this disruption of this relationship.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.180]   And in previous week,
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.140]   we look at broken relationships with God,
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.400]   with ourselves, two weeks ago,
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.900]   I spoke a little bit about that.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.920]   And last week, we talked about a relationship with others.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.180]   And today, we will look at the final one.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.940]   We will explore God's original intention
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.900]   for our relationship with the rest of his creation,
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.580]   what happened when humanity decided to rebel,
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.060]   and how would God fix this mess?
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.220]   And I believe today,
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.280]   we will also answer a very important question.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.100]   What does being a follower of Christ have to do
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.960]   with all the efforts to protect and preserve the planet
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   we now reside on?
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.220]   Why, like why do we care as Christians?
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.520]   And I could tell you from my experience,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.080]   could we have the next slide, please?
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.060]   As a Christian spending like my entire life in Hong Kong,
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.840]   growing up in the church,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.440]   every time when there is these like NGO coming to my school,
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   giving a talk, or I see a TV program or advertisement,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.840]   I never felt that was,
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.140]   or I know the urgency,
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.620]   but I never felt it has anything to do with my faith,
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.020]   with my identity as a Christian.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.500]   But I believe today, we are going to dive deep into that.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.500]   But just let me say that I'm not here to give you
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.900]   some educational information or presentation.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.420]   I wanna open the word of God with you.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.380]   And I can only do that in the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.500]   and in his enlightenment.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.700]   So how about we pray together first?
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.520]   Is that right?
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.240]   Father, we wanna know your heart.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.580]   Perhaps this is one of the blind spot in your church,
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.020]   our relationship with the rest of your creation.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.060]   So Father, we just pray that today,
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.860]   it's not just information,
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.840]   it's not just Bible knowledge.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.780]   Father, we wanna know your heart.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.860]   And I know as much as your heart burns for us,
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.580]   your heart burns for the rest of your creation.
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.640]   They are your craftsmanship as well.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.340]   So God, we pray you would come
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.680]   and share your heart with us today.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.020]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.320]   Amen.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.960]   If you wanna know God's original plan for us
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.680]   and for the rest of creation,
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.880]   of course you have to go back to a book in the Bible.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.400]   And that is Genesis.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.520]   I hear that, yes.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.160]   So we're going back to Genesis one.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.180]   I'll be short 'cause I know you know a lot about that.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.320]   Let's go to verse 20.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.280]   I'll start with 28 maybe.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.080]   God blessed them, Adam and Eve,
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.960]   and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.600]   fill the earth and subdue it.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.080]   Rule over the fish in the sea and birds in the sky
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.520]   and over every living creature that moves on the ground."
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.760]   All right, Genesis one,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.740]   it says we were to subdue and rule over God's creation.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.060]   Do you feel very powerful right now?
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.880]   So we're the boss, right?
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.260]   We all rule over them.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.280]   But does that mean we can do whatever we want?
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.860]   Let's look at one more verse in the next chapter.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.160]   We're gonna look at chapter two, verse 15.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.960]   Here it says, "The Lord God took the man, Adam,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.820]   and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.280]   and take care of it."
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.520]   And let's take a closer look at these two verbs here,
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.340]   to work and to take care.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.000]   The Hebrew word for work here, it's avad.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.640]   It means to serve with a sense of doing hard work
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.600]   in the process of serving.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.000]   So God says, "I'm gonna put Adam, I'm gonna put you here.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.200]   I'm gonna put humanity in my garden."
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.880]   And they are to serve it,
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.000]   serve it with diligence, with hard work.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.200]   And also they are to take care of it.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   And the Hebrew word here is shamar.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.160]   Shamar literally means to guard and to preserve.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.280]   So we are in charge of security, basically.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.180]   Or we're in charge of growing it, developing it.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.480]   So our job as humans or as image bearers of God,
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.600]   we were supposed to rule over creation,
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.560]   but it means in a way of serving, of caring,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.900]   so that the whole creation would flourish under our care.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.960]   That's the original plan.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.600]   And if we look at the book of Psalms,
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.360]   we will see two interesting descriptions.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.600]   Let's look at Psalms 24, verse one.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.520]   It says here, "The earth is the Lord's
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.120]   and everything in it, the world and all who live in it."
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.200]   So here it says, "The earth is the Lord's,"
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.360]   and it speaks of God's ownership over the entire creation.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.640]   But here in the next verse on the screen,
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.400]   Psalm 115, 16, it says this,
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.600]   "The highest heavens belong to the Lord,
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.600]   but the earth he has given to mankind," or human race.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.360]   So the earth he has given to human race.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.160]   These two statements are kind of like,
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.440]   if you first listen to it, you're like,
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   are you sure, like, are they saying the same thing,
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.320]   or like, are they different?
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.360]   They're actually complementary to each other.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.320]   They actually together give us a full picture.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.280]   So while Psalm 24 speaks of the ownership
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.400]   of God in his creation,
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.200]   Psalm 115 actually talks about our stewardship
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.120]   because of his delegation.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.580]   So God, at his creation, he has ownership,
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.620]   but on the other hand, because of his delegation to us,
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.980]   we have stewardship.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.000]   So while God owns everything because he's the creator,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.640]   he has chosen a partnership.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.580]   He has chosen a partnership with you and me
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.120]   and with humanity as his representative
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.800]   to rule over the creation.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.440]   We rule on his behalf.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.680]   We are his stewards, or we're supposed to be,
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.940]   of course, right, until the fall.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.940]   So two weeks ago, I talk about what happened
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.260]   in the Garden of Eden in Genesis chapter three,
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.940]   when Adam and Eve decided to take the fruit
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.580]   from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.220]   I mentioned how their rejection of God
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.780]   immediately resulted in the rejection of themselves,
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.340]   and they were left with shame and insecurity
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.160]   and selfishness in their brokenness.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.420]   We were supposed to be other-centered.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.740]   If you still remember what I talked about two weeks ago,
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.380]   we were supposed to care for others,
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.200]   meaning that we were supposed to have this capacity
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.380]   to care for other people around us
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.860]   and also for the rest of God's creation.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.900]   We were supposed to have their best interest in our mind,
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.780]   and that's the part of what stewardship would look like,
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.180]   that we care for them even more than ourselves sometimes.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.460]   But as we have witnessed this
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.500]   in the long history of humanity again and again,
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.620]   our selfishness and our self-centeredness
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.260]   has corrupted us, right?
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:38.260]   It turns us from stewards into consumers, like takers.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:43.060]   We take what we want for our own pleasure.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.940]   Our primary goal becomes the satisfactions
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.260]   of our own desires over everything else.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260]   So speaking of consumers,
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.980]   I remember when I was a little bit younger,
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.420]   what they call in a stormy kind of period of life,
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.340]   I couldn't exactly say my relationship with my family,
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.120]   especially my parents.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.140]   I can't say it's a loving relationship.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.980]   I remember I didn't talk a lot with them back then.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:17.900]   So what I do, it's I would always hang out
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.340]   with other people or just by myself outside
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.460]   until very, very late, until everyone at home is asleep,
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.460]   and then I would go home so I don't have to talk to anyone.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.780]   And so because I went home so late
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.180]   and I slept in like really, really late as well,
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.340]   so by the time I woke up the next morning,
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.100]   everybody has gone to work or school or whatever,
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.460]   so I never had to speak to anyone.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.820]   Until there was one day, I think my dad was lucky,
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.900]   he caught me while both of us were awake,
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.220]   and he said this to me,
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.500]   "What do you think of this place?
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.460]   "Do you treat your home as a hotel?"
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:01.340]   And speaking of hotel, I'm actually traveling this week,
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.880]   and I must say that sometimes the best part
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.380]   of my favorite part of traveling is staying in a hotel
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.400]   because I don't have to make my bed in the morning.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.940]   When I wake up, I can mess it up,
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.580]   and I go out and I come back,
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.460]   oh, it's just new as, you know, it's a new bed.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.000]   I can mess up the bathroom, the entire room,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.460]   I can throw things everywhere.
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.380]   When I come back, oh, it's a new room.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.260]   So I can do whatever I want, right?
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.640]   And I can, you know, I can mess it up,
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.980]   I can do whatever I want,
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.980]   and in the hotel, I always get what I want.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.820]   My, you know, I don't have any responsibilities,
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.220]   I only have rights there.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.500]   Yeah, I know, of course, I have to pay,
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.260]   but then when you go in there,
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260]   you're the customers, you're always right,
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.200]   I can get what I want, how I want, when I want.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.940]   That's consumer, rights only, without responsibility.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.420]   And as a result of what happened in the garden
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.820]   in Genesis chapter three, humans, we,
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.340]   we traded responsible stewardship
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.060]   with selfish consumerism.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.260]   Hey, let me say that again.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.720]   We traded responsible stewardship
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.220]   with selfish consumerism.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.260]   And that's what we've been doing to our environment,
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.580]   to the creation of God, deforestation,
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.860]   destruction of natural habitats of many plants
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.620]   and animal species in exchange for urban development,
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:33.100]   overfishing, industrial pollution in the air, water,
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.740]   just to name a few, and what's really injustice here
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.060]   is not just what we do to the environment
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.360]   or to the creation of God.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.780]   A lot of times, urban pollution,
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.500]   those who are really affected are the poor,
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.420]   are the underprivileged.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.060]   And while the rich, the privileged,
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.700]   they just enjoy their life and they continue
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.220]   with their lifestyle and the pollution went on and on,
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.100]   and those who suffer are normally those without resources.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.080]   That's injustice.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.480]   The breakdown of our relationship
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.380]   with the environment or creation
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.180]   didn't just come from a sinfulness,
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.000]   although we just talk about that,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.900]   it also comes from the judgment of God.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.500]   So we know that actually God talked to Adam and Eve
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.260]   after they took the fruit, after they tried to hide.
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.420]   This is where I left off last time,
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:28.420]   so I'm gonna read from Genesis 3, let's start with 17.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.860]   So to Adam, God said, "Because you listened to your wife
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.420]   "and ate fruit from the tree which I commanded you
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.060]   "you must not eat from it,
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.100]   "cursed is the ground because of you.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.820]   "Through painful toil, you will eat fruit from it
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.780]   "all the days of your life," and so on and on and on.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.140]   So here we see something that we might have missed
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.900]   in our reading of the Bible.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.380]   What we see here, it's a fundamental change
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.140]   in the relationship between human beings
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.700]   and the land and the rest of creation.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.180]   Our job as humans was to work and to take care of the land
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:09.180]   and it would, on your hand, produce and provide what we need
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.540]   but it will now be done in the context of brokenness,
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.420]   hard labor and potential fruitlessness.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.580]   So we can work all day and we can farm
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.340]   but maybe there are storms or there are calamities
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.940]   and the ground is not producing what we want.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:31.260]   So we experience that, we experience fruitlessness
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.420]   and our relationship with the earth,
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.580]   with the creation, it's broken.
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.060]   Let me read to you from a Bible scholar,
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.740]   his name is Douglas Moo.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.860]   It's a little bit long but I'm just gonna read from it.
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.940]   He says, "While creation, not in itself,
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.380]   "guilty of sin, creation suffers
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.500]   "because of the sin of human beings,"
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.780]   which we just talked about.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.020]   "The sin of Adam brought God's curse on creation,
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.780]   "a curse that focuses on new estrangement
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.140]   "between humans and creation.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.780]   "Continuing human sin corrupts creation in various ways.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.980]   "We selfishly and mindlessly consume its resources.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.940]   "We pollute it with unsafe manufacturing processes.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.940]   "We accelerate potential harmful atmospheric changes
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.060]   "by pouring greenhouse gases into the air.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.180]   "Simply put, the decay of creation means
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.320]   "that it is used and abused in ways God never intended,
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.480]   "preventing it from being what it was designed to be
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   "and thereby hindering its ability fully to glorify God."
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.860]   So there's one thing very important.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.300]   We thought as human beings we are the only creation
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.400]   and the entire world that only we could glorify God
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.340]   because we are the image of God.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.440]   Sorry, that's not what the Bible is saying.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.780]   The Bible says God takes glory in his entire creation.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.760]   When you look at sunrise or sunset,
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.100]   when you look at the beauty of it,
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.520]   normally your first reaction is, wow, God, you're amazing.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.360]   But nowadays in Hong Kong, you try to look at a sunset,
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.400]   oh, it's foggy, that's smoky,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.560]   like I can't see the sunset really.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.460]   Our pollution, we are undermining the creation's ability
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.660]   to reflect God's glory.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.460]   Just one very small example.
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.720]   This is what he's saying.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.720]   This is what happens when the earth is filled
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.440]   with selfish consumers rather than faithful stewards.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.320]   And it is taking up more and more airtime
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.360]   on our news in recent years.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.800]   It's not too hard for us to notice that this generation,
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.560]   our generation, is starting to witness
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.200]   and even suffer from the consequences of human selfishness
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.960]   and abuse towards the environment.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:59.840]   Hottest mid-autumn or whatever day every year.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.740]   If every year the temperature,
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.440]   we have a record-breaking temperature,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.800]   it's getting hotter and hotter,
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.580]   could you even imagine what it's gonna look like
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.800]   in a children's generation?
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.840]   And in the generation of the children of our children?
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.200]   What would that look like?
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.560]   Sometimes when I think of my kids, I'm like,
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.120]   if I'm feeling so horrible right now,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.500]   what are they gonna go through in 30 years time
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.920]   when they're my age?
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:29.680]   The stewards are irresponsible, that's unfortunate.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.220]   But the good news is that the owner is always faithful.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.580]   And here's the important part we always miss out
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.740]   in the story of God, that Christ,
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.580]   He didn't just come to redeem you and me or humanity.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.580]   He came to redeem and restore His entire creation.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.340]   We can see His end game in the last book of the Bible,
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.260]   which is Revelation.
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.940]   He's going to renew His creation.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.800]   He's going to make all things new.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.080]   And you have to note that,
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.920]   He's not going to make all new things.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.200]   He's going to make all things new.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.140]   He's going to renew His whole creation.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.600]   So we now have a creation that is suffering
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.280]   because of the sins of human,
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.760]   but God has promised that one day
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.520]   He will make all things new
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.640]   when Jesus eventually comes back
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.320]   as the glorious and victorious King
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.640]   to right every wrong and to destroy evil
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.500]   from the planet earth once and for all.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.540]   And so I want to, in light of this,
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.700]   I want to read to you what Paul wrote in Romans 8,
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.420]   which you may have read, but found it a little bit weird.
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.260]   I'm telling you, a lot of us, a lot of churches,
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.180]   we never talk about justice and creation.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.600]   We never read the Bible this way.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.180]   So this part of the Bible or these couple of verses
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.860]   always seem very weird to us.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.120]   But if you could look at these verses
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.420]   through the lens of justice and creation,
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.180]   everything would become just crystal clear.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.120]   Let me read it to you.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.120]   Romans 8, starting from verse 19.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.660]   For the creation waits in eager expectation
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.260]   for the children of God to be revealed.
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.980]   Just let me pause and explain to you here.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.540]   Who's the children of God here?
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.700]   Anybody?
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.040]   Okay, got a few at least, not bad.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.900]   I expected a little bit more.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.640]   I hope we should really work hard on evangelism, Tim.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.460]   Anyway, okay.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:26.100]   As the children of God here, we're saved by grace.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.980]   We're saved by Jesus.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.380]   And so what does revelation of God's children
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.340]   mean by Paul here?
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.140]   We have been through the Galatians series.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:37.920]   We know that now God causes his children, we're in Jesus,
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.380]   and he sends his spirit of his son into us.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.300]   So now we're his children, we're his sons and daughters.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.980]   But we know that even though we're saved,
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.980]   we're not experiencing the entire eternal life right now
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.420]   because we're still going through sickness and death
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.700]   on this planet.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.900]   So eternal life, it started already,
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.460]   but we only experience the fullness of it
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.740]   when Jesus come back, when our bodies,
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.820]   these dead bodies will resurrect one day with him
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.620]   because of his resurrection.
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.080]   We're going to resurrect with him.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.620]   That's the day when the children of God are fully revealed.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.580]   So this is what Paul is talking about here.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.940]   The creation waits in eager expectation for that day,
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.580]   for the children of God to be revealed.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.620]   For the creation was subjected to frustration
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.180]   or fertility in some versions, not by his own choice,
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.100]   but by the will of the one who subjected it
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.740]   because of the sins of human, because we're tied together.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.820]   God subjected creation to humans.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.700]   When we sin, when we choose to pollute this earth,
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.380]   it's affected.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.300]   This earth, this creation, it was supposed to reflect
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.580]   the glory of God, but now that purpose was destroyed as well
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.940]   because of our sin.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.680]   It was subjected to frustration, subjected to fertility.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.900]   But in, let me just see where I am.
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.660]   But yeah, so verse 21, in hope that the creation itself
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.820]   will be liberated from its bondage to decay
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.620]   and brought into the freedom and glory of children of God.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.060]   Again, our glory comes from the day
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.760]   when Christ finally returns as the victorious King
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.020]   and we will experience resurrection.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.420]   And that day is the day the entire creation
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.900]   is looking forward to.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.820]   They would experience liberation from bondage to decay.
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.740]   Let's see what we're doing to the earth right now.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.300]   It's getting worse and worse, it's decaying.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.340]   But that day when the sons and daughters of God are revealed
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.080]   when we are finally standing in a glory with Jesus,
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.200]   the entire earth, they will be liberated.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.040]   Why?
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.400]   Because it's not just about us getting into heaven
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.040]   and like, oh hallelujah.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.520]   It's about us being restored first as sons and daughters
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.880]   of God and we will stand in a rightful place
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.240]   when a relationship with God is restored,
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   a rightful place as stewards of this planet
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.260]   will be restored.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.920]   And then we would know it's time for us to work,
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.960]   to avart and to shamar, to care for the entire creation
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.280]   around us when the sons and daughters of God are restored
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.920]   and we're standing in that glory
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.000]   when we are so secure in our identity in Christ,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.920]   we know we are sons and daughters of God.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.800]   We know we're supposed to be in a partnership with Him
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.720]   to take care of the entire creation.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.920]   We're supposed to rule over it.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.560]   And when we accept that responsibility,
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.380]   that's the liberation of the creation.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.800]   They can finally say, oh, thank you.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.260]   I love verse 22.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.700]   It says, we know that the whole creation has been groaning
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.380]   as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.260]   I have the privilege to witness childbirth
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.340]   two times in my life.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.180]   And it's painful to watch, to even just watch.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.280]   Of course, also because that person will pinch you,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.820]   but it's just painful to watch
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.540]   without her pinching me as well.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:19.300]   Anyway, yeah, it's really painful.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.220]   But in that pain, (groans)
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.620]   you know something beautiful, it's coming.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.500]   That's what's happening with creation.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.740]   They know that the new creation is coming.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.540]   They know Jesus is coming back to right every wrong,
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.060]   to make all things new.
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.420]   They are suffering right now,
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.660]   but they're looking forward to that day
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.520]   when God finally comes back
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.800]   and all his people will stand with him
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.480]   in their rightful place at the steward of this world.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.540]   And they are waiting, eagerly waiting for that day.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.520]   They say, finally, please, I want that day to come quickly.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.480]   Please, they're groaning right now.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.800]   And that is what is happening with creation right now.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.200]   Paul is saying, you know what?
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.280]   The entire creation is suffering just like you and me.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.600]   We're suffering from sickness, from pain,
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.460]   from this life as well.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.760]   But we know that one day
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.740]   we would experience bodily resurrection.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:17.040]   And in the same way, the creation will be renewed.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.920]   And they are also looking forward to that
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   when God comes back and make all things new.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.420]   You see, the cross of Jesus
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.920]   restored our relationship with God,
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.560]   with ourselves, with others.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.960]   And it restored our relationship with the creation as well.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   He reconciled us back to, Jesus reconciled us back to him,
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.140]   to God, and so we can trust him.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.460]   We can follow him.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.840]   We can obey him.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.740]   We can be obedient to his standards
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.820]   of right and wrong, of good and evil.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.420]   And we can finally partner with him
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.840]   to rule over his creation.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.960]   We can only do it if we say amen to his standards.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.320]   When we obey him.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.660]   We cannot do it in our own way.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.920]   Otherwise, we're just gonna be selfish consumers.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.600]   We're just gonna mess it up again.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.540]   Only when we come finally with obedience to Jesus,
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.160]   we can take up that rightful place as stewards,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.040]   as rulers in this planet,
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.480]   to work to take care of the creation
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.460]   that God has put in our charge.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:26.180]   So church, that means being a disciple of Jesus,
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:31.120]   we now move from selfish consumerism
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.320]   back to faithful and responsible stewardship.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.640]   That's what being a Christian is all about.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.080]   Oh, not all about, but yeah, there's so many things,
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.460]   but this is one of the many things.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:48.680]   And the theologian John Stott, he put it this way.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.120]   He said, "Our care of the creation
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.280]   "will reflect our love of the creator."
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.680]   Can I get an amen for that?
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.720]   It's time for us to do that.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.440]   I'm just gonna quote one more theologian.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.680]   His name is Chris Wright.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.720]   Says this, "It seems quite inexplicable to me
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.220]   "that there are some Christians
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.100]   "who claim to love and worship God,
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.460]   "to be disciples of Jesus,
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.780]   "and yet have no concern for the earth
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.240]   "that bears his stamp of ownership.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.560]   "They do not care about the abuse of the earth,
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.540]   "and indeed, by their wasteful
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.760]   "and over-consumptive lifestyles,
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.620]   "they contribute to it."
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.880]   Guilty as charged.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.360]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:36.000]   If you wanna know how we're supposed to rule over creation,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.800]   I think we just need to look at Jesus.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.260]   In Matthew 5, verse five, Jesus says this.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.380]   He says, "Blessed are the meek,
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.840]   "for they will inherit the earth."
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.440]   Jesus presented meekness as a profound quality
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.360]   that contrasts sharply with typical notions
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.940]   of power and authority.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.240]   If we follow the example of Jesus,
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.000]   it would mean rejecting exploitative power
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.800]   and embracing stewardship rooted in love.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.440]   Our authority over creation should be characterized
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.520]   by compassion, by restoration, and by service.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.280]   We should be serving the environment around us.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.540]   So I know this is, whoa, theology.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.160]   This is like, whoa, very, in Singlish,
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.380]   they call it very chim, which means very abstract, right?
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.500]   No, very deep, very profound.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.220]   I still get Singlish wrong, anyway.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.100]   But I've got three very practical tips for us.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.880]   Some of them you might have heard of it before.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.840]   Some of them, hopefully, you're practicing,
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.980]   but let's just go through them.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.380]   I think we can live sustainably,
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:49.380]   and it cannot be overemphasized in our age right now.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.220]   If you're not using those lights or fans
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.720]   or electrical appliances, just,
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.600]   there's an off button there, you know, right?
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.360]   Just switch it off.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.080]   You know, don't use too many papers.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.400]   You know, recycle, the three R's,
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.600]   reduce, recycle, and reuse.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.160]   You know, all these, we've been educated enough,
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.780]   we have enough knowledge to live sustainably.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.720]   Quoting Master Yoda from Star Wars,
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.620]   stop trying and just do it, all right?
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.360]   Number two, consume consciously.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.800]   I have a confession.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.280]   I have spent less money in the past year,
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.760]   partly because I switched to a part-time role
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.040]   from a full-time role,
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.640]   and then I started challenging myself,
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.400]   do I really need those stuff that I casually buy
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.740]   without even looking at the price tag?
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.960]   And then I realized in the past year,
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.840]   I bought a lot less clutter,
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.960]   according to Rosalind, those are clutter.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.440]   So I, and I still survive, or I thrive,
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.000]   like nothing is wrong with me,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.080]   and I'm enjoying my life,
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   so buying less is not a problem at all.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.480]   And I'm telling you, you know how fast
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.880]   the expansion of the population has been.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.880]   Currently, in 2020, it was about 60 billion,
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.840]   six billion, 60 billion?
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.760]   Too bad, six billion, six billion.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.320]   2020, it was about six billion people.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.960]   Right now, seven-something billion people.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.760]   Projection says by 2050,
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.920]   there will be 9.5 billion people on the planet.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.940]   Do you know what that means?
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.840]   Number one, there will be food shortage,
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.880]   and number two, we're creating a lot of rubbish every day.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.280]   Every time I taobao, I have a confession to God,
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.280]   secretly I'm like, God, I don't know why they do that.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.280]   I just buy this small part of a camera, accessories,
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.720]   and they give me a box like this.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.920]   God, forgive me, and forgive them.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:57.720]   The more we consume, the more we create waste.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.400]   So consume consciously.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:08.120]   And number three, choose simplicity.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.840]   Do you know that simplicity is actually
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.480]   a spiritual discipline in Christianity?
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.460]   We are supposed to live a simple life,
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.300]   life doesn't have to be too complicated.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.980]   You don't need like 10 holidays,
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.860]   you don't need like 10 different sets of headphones,
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.420]   or 10 different watches, or 10 different,
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.940]   sorry, sorry, I see somebody looking at their wrist
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.260]   immediately, sorry, sorry, sorry, okay.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.740]   But you know, you get what I mean.
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.580]   We can choose simplicity,
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.900]   we can consume consciously, responsibly,
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.620]   we can live sustainably.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:51.420]   I actually have an open water scuba diver license,
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.500]   to your surprise.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.020]   So I used to be part of a diver's community,
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.740]   and every year around spring,
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.380]   the diver's community would go out,
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.660]   go to Saicom or somewhere,
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.540]   they would dive and clean the bottom of the ocean.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.380]   And do you know what day that is?
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.540]   Do you know what day they choose to do that?
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.780]   No, it's spring, so they chose to,
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.460]   close, they actually, not the birthday of Jesus,
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.620]   they chose to do it in the Tin Hao birthday.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.260]   So you know that place Tin Hao in Causeway Bay, right?
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.460]   Tin Hao, it's actually the goddess of sea
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.540]   in the Chinese tradition.
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:32.980]   What does that mean?
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.020]   It means that there are people in this city
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:41.020]   choosing to avart, to shamar the creation of God
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.500]   in the name of an idol.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.540]   And we're doing nothing.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:52.700]   If we are truly followers of Jesus,
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.100]   if we truly understand what it means
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.540]   that the earth belongs to God,
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.180]   he has his ownership, but we have a stewardship,
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.540]   but if we really understand what stewardship
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.340]   in Christ look like,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.740]   I think there's so much more we can do
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.300]   for the creation of God.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.700]   Can I get an amen for that?
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.100]   How about we invite the Holy Spirit
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.940]   to convict our hearts and why don't we pray together now?
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:17.780]   Let's pray.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:27.140]   Yeah, God, like thinking of people
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.460]   who are caring for your creation in the name of an idol
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.180]   give me goosebumps, like, oh, I can't live with it.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:37.100]   But yeah, God, we are, as Christians,
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.060]   as the rightful stewards of your creation,
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:43.020]   we are doing nothing.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.060]   We thought it's not in the Bible,
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.620]   I didn't see environmental protection in the Bible,
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.780]   so it's none of my business, I don't have to do anything.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.780]   Father, we are sorry
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:02.540]   that we, maybe many people in this room, like me,
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.380]   we could identify more with the selfish consumer
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:10.300]   rather than the faithful stewards in your kingdom.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.460]   God, we pray for your forgiveness.
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.860]   Father, we come before you today to confess our sins,
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.900]   to say that, Lord, we know we have been contributing
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.540]   to injustice in this world
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:29.020]   because our relationship with the creation was broken.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.180]   Our relationship with you is broken.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:35.260]   So, God, we just pray that today you will come
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.380]   and restore those relationships.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:44.220]   I pray that there will be a conviction in our hearts
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.620]   in your church today
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:51.180]   that we know what it means to be your sons and daughters,
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:55.660]   to be stewards of your creation,
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.300]   what it means to rule over
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.780]   with the heart of Jesus,
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:06.300]   to protect, to conserve,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.860]   to serve.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:13.980]   Father, we just pray that you will come and speak to us
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.420]   in our everyday life.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.700]   And if there are initiatives,
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.100]   if there are things that we can do,
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.140]   we pray you just give us that prompt and say,
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.780]   "Hey, let's go and do it."
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:28.900]   Father, we pray we will be protector of your creation,
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.980]   not destroyer.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.980]   So come, Holy Spirit.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.260]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
