[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   In Jesus' name, everyone says, amen, amen, amen.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.400]   Can we thank our worship team as always?
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.840]   And have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.560]   You know, in the last two weeks here at the Vine
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.680]   in our Exodus series, we've been situated
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.200]   in two incredibly important chapters.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.920]   Chapters 19 and 20 of Exodus,
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.400]   which really are a pivotal turning point
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.040]   in the whole narrative of the story.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.840]   Israel is free.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.800]   God has brought them out of their slavery
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.840]   for over 200 years and has brought them to Mount Sinai.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.920]   And he's brought them to Mount Sinai
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.040]   because he wants to fellowship with them personally.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.720]   He wants to connect with them face-to-face, if you will.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.400]   And in Mount Sinai, chapters 19 and 20,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.200]   God begins to redefine the identity of a broken people.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.160]   Because up until that point,
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.400]   Israel was carrying around still their Pharaoh identity.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.800]   Slavery has stripped them of who they truly are.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   And God gathered them at Mount Sinai in chapters 19 and 20,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.960]   and he speaks to them about who they really are.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.000]   Chapter 19, as we saw two weeks ago,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.560]   he says, "You're a kingdom of priests
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.320]   "and you're a holy nation."
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.400]   Israel needed to understand that they had a function
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400]   to connect God and the world together.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400]   They had a function to walk on behalf
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.160]   of the imitation of God in the world,
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.840]   to be his hands and his feet around them.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.320]   But they understood they're called a separateness as well.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.320]   They're called a holiness,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.280]   to represent something of the heart of God in this place.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.120]   And then in chapters 20, as we saw last week,
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.960]   we see that God begins to speak to them
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.800]   about how they are to interact with him,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.680]   with themselves, and with one another,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.200]   to form, if you will, a worshiping community.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.480]   And in chapter 20, we see he gives the 10 commandments,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.920]   as we know of them, these 10 words in the Hebrew.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.640]   This idea of what it is to love God,
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.720]   to love ourselves, and to love one another.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.000]   And through all of this, what God's trying to do is say,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   "There's an identity that I want you to hold now
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.440]   "as a free worshiping community."
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.120]   And that identity is important
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.040]   because when you come to know yourself as children of God,
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.640]   you can then live out of that identity
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.640]   in the world around you.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.800]   God brings them to himself
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.960]   so that he can then send them back to the world.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.000]   He had to bring them and purge them
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.560]   out of the brokenness of the slavery of the world,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.520]   bring them to himself, so that in relationship with him
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.280]   and in receiving their identity in him,
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.440]   they could then go and serve the world,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.360]   bring the world into its fruition,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   by saying there's an alternative way to live,
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.200]   that there's a new hope that's found
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.120]   in this idea of who God is and his character in the world.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.000]   And what we've been seeing over the last two weeks
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.960]   is it's the same for us,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.560]   that we, the church today, have the same call on us
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.320]   that God brings to Israel
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.520]   as they're gathered around Mount Sinai.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.280]   We ourselves have been taken out of a place of slavery,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.880]   the slavery of our sin,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.760]   and we've been brought to Christ Jesus.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.120]   And in relationship with Christ Jesus,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.360]   our Mount Sinai, if you will,
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.720]   we receive the law not written on tablets of stone anymore,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   but by his spirit written on our hearts.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.280]   And out of that, we can now live as a worshiping community
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.800]   in the world around us, going out into Hong Kong
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.360]   and saying we believe a church can change a city.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.560]   We believe that God and who he is and his character
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.160]   and the narrative he creates for this world
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.200]   has something to say to the brokenness of this world.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.240]   And so we're a sent people.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.560]   And what I wanna talk today about with you,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.520]   and I'm gonna talk really passionately today,
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.280]   so if you don't like passion, I apologize beforehand.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.000]   But I'm passionate because I'm talking today
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.840]   about the church.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.880]   It's the one thing I love the most, the church,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.600]   and all of its frailty and all of its brokenness
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.360]   and all of its challenging diversity.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.720]   The church is God's hope in the world.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.240]   And as we see what happens
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.200]   in the next 11 chapters of the story,
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.320]   we see some important things that we need to understand
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.320]   about what it is to be Christ's hands and feet
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.400]   in the world that he's planted us in.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.200]   Chapters 21 to 31 are actually 10 chapters
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.880]   where God expands on this idea of what it means
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.400]   to be a worshiping community.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.160]   And in there, you see actually three critical things.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.680]   The first in chapters 21 to 24 is a continuation from God
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.640]   out of the 10 commandments of how Israel should form
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.040]   and work together, how they should love one another.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.280]   And he speaks to them about their social responsibility.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.080]   He speaks to them about their equity
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.520]   that they're supposed to have amongst each other,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.440]   how they're supposed to handle property
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.440]   and laws amongst themselves
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.920]   so that they can truly be an equitable
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.760]   and just community in an unjust world.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.760]   And then chapters 25 to 27 and chapters 30 and 31,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.400]   God speaks to them about a new thought.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.760]   He says, I want you to create a place of worship.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.800]   It comes to be known as the tabernacle
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.960]   in the rest of the Exodus story,
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.400]   in the rest of the Old Testament.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.280]   And the tabernacle essentially was a tent of meaning,
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.640]   but it was a complex tent.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.920]   And for a bunch of chapters,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.520]   God speaks about how they are to create this tent
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.480]   and the artifacts that are gonna go in that tent
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.960]   so that it can become a place of worship.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.200]   So that whilst they're a nomadic community
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.520]   and before they go to establish the temple in Jerusalem
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.600]   many years later,
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.480]   they would have a place to come to to worship their God.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.080]   And then in chapters 28 and 29,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.760]   the third thing God speaks to them about
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.400]   is the priestly class amongst them.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.480]   He says, set aside people who can serve in the tabernacle,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.760]   the very people who would eventually go
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.040]   and serve in the temple,
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.000]   and these ones will serve the worship life
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.960]   of that community.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.980]   And in chapters 21 to 31,
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.280]   we see a picture really of God's perception
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.280]   of what a worshiping community on earth should look like,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.560]   what the church, if you will, should look like,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.400]   how we should be just and loving and kind and equitable
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.120]   amongst each other to model something in the world,
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.920]   how we are to know that our identity at its very heart
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.800]   is to be a worshiping community
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.720]   and what it means to be worshipers on earth.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.160]   And then out of that,
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.840]   what it means for us to be a mission focused
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.760]   community of people.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.920]   We do not gather every week for 90 minutes in this room
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.840]   just so that we can feel good.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.760]   I'm not interested in building a church
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.760]   where you come to feel good.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.580]   Oh, I'm gonna preach on this one for a moment.
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.720]   I hope you enjoy coming to the Vine, okay?
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.180]   But my purpose is not to preach.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.220]   Our purpose to do what we do here at the Vine
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.920]   is not designed just so that you feel
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.400]   a little bit better about your life.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.240]   It's designed to change a city.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.860]   And in order to change a city,
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.280]   we have to understand what it is that we're called to
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.520]   as believers in Christ.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.440]   And so 21 to 31 shows us that.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.000]   But in 32,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.620]   chapter 32 of Exodus,
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.700]   we see perhaps what is one of the most horrendous things
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.760]   happen in the whole of the Exodus story itself.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.440]   And in what happens to Israel in Exodus 32,
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.240]   we see what I would call
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.680]   are the three greatest temptations that exist
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.680]   for any church to weaken and disempower it
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.200]   for the way in which it wants to change
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.900]   the society around it.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.320]   Three things in that chapter
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.060]   that show us the way in which the enemy is at work
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.760]   to disempower and weaken the body of Christ
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.360]   for its purposes in the world.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.740]   And so this is why I'm gonna teach passionately today
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.960]   because I love the church.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.920]   I love you.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.640]   And I believe the church can change a society.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.640]   But these three things we're looking at today,
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.280]   I'm gonna say this upfront,
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.800]   are three things that I think we struggle with
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.440]   here at the Vine sometimes.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.080]   I think we struggle with these things as a community,
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.400]   as a congregation.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.380]   I know that I personally struggle with them
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.280]   as a person individually.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.180]   And I wonder as I unpack them,
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.080]   whether you might resonate with that a little bit.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.620]   And I think therefore God might wanna do some healing
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.960]   and some change and transformation in us
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.420]   where we can recognize what the enemy is trying to do
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.240]   to disempower us, stand against it,
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.160]   so we might truly be Christ's hands and feet in a city.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.080]   Does that sound interesting to anyone here?
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.560]   You're right.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.560]   Wonderful.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.640]   There's one thing that sits behind
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.480]   all three of those temptations.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.000]   And it's the one thing that we see happen in Exodus 32.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.700]   Introduce you to that one thing.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.080]   Let me take you back once again to Mount Sinai.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:48.680]   It is within the shadow of the great Mount Sinai itself
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.320]   that the darkest moment of the Exodus story occurs.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.760]   Exodus 32 is a brutal chapter,
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.880]   outlining idol worship, sin, burning anger,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.280]   punishment, and even death.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.660]   For the reader of the Exodus narrative,
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.740]   it's actually shockingly jarring
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.980]   coming off the back of such great chapters
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.060]   as Moses' ascent up the mountain
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.180]   and the giving of the law
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.700]   and his ongoing presence with his people.
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.420]   I mean, from the intimacy of God with them
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.420]   to his burning anger against their sin.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.260]   Now, all of this is a stark reminder to us
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.180]   of one of the most important messages
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.060]   of the whole Exodus journey.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.500]   And that's this,
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.980]   that so often the most damaging slavery
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.340]   that happens to us is the slavery of the heart.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.360]   Egypt had one of the largest
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.860]   and most complex pantheons of gods
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.740]   of any civilization in the ancient world.
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.220]   Over the course of ancient Egyptian daily life,
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.020]   hundreds of gods and goddesses
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.620]   could be worshipped at any one time.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.320]   These gods were assumed to be present throughout the world,
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.620]   capable of influencing natural events
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.520]   and the course of human lives.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.020]   So connection with these gods
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.140]   was of paramount importance to ancient Egyptians.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.100]   And that connection largely came
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.700]   through physical representations of the gods themselves.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.540]   So carvings, statues, amulets, sculptures,
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.940]   idols were literally everywhere.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.100]   And the more idols you had around you,
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.260]   the better you would be able
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.020]   to make a connection to the gods.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.020]   And therefore the better your life
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.060]   and the lives of your loved ones would be.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.420]   In modern day Cairo today,
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.460]   you can still see so much of this kind
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.300]   of ancient idol worship culture.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.540]   These tourist markets in old Cairo are a clear example.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.900]   These various sculptures of Egyptian gods
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.900]   are done out of the most beautiful turquoise
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.060]   found native to this part of the world.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.540]   And while these are of course,
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.860]   not designed to be specifically used for worship today,
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.140]   they give you the idea of the kinds of gods
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.020]   that were constantly on display
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.920]   at the time that the Israelites were slaves in this land.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.860]   It should not surprise us then
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.500]   that Israel struggled to adapt
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.860]   to a new form of spirituality
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.940]   as they emerged out of their slavery
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.020]   and met with God on Mount Sinai
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.380]   and actually received the 10 commandments.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.460]   I mean, think about it from their perspective.
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.780]   They had been immersed in an idol worship culture
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.380]   for over 400 years.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.820]   And that culture had seeped
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.380]   into the very essence of who they were.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.380]   So as Moses took his time on the top of the mountain,
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.380]   actually Israel grew itchy.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.940]   They took the gold that they had taken from Egypt
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.300]   and they asked Aaron to form for them a golden calf
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.620]   so they could worship that as a picture of Yahweh,
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.420]   just like they had seen the Egyptians
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.300]   form and worship their own gods in Egypt.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:42.140]   I think it's fascinating how we see in Exodus 32,
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.980]   something play out that is actually spiritually significant
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.300]   for the whole of the Exodus narrative.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.940]   You see, the Exodus is not so much
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.220]   about getting Israel out of Egypt
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.860]   as it is about getting Egypt out of Israel.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.180]   And it's the same, of course, for us.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.940]   You see, any journey from slavery to freedom
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.020]   is going to require actually the purging from us
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.460]   of any of the cultures or the values
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.500]   or the habits or the brokenness
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.260]   that we embraced in our time of slavery.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.500]   You see, in the formation of the golden calf,
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.860]   what actually was happening
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.480]   was that Israel was essentially saying
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.780]   that despite all the miracles of God
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.620]   and all the physical liberation that they had received,
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.880]   the chains of slavery and oppression
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.740]   were still tightly entangled around their hearts.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.580]   And here is what angered God the most about that.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.260]   They just didn't seem to care.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.620]   I mean, they were happy to live
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.320]   with this half-baked kind of freedom
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.620]   where they had a little bit of what God wanted,
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.900]   but they were still holding onto
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.780]   the brokenness of their past.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.380]   So when they fashioned that idol of Yahweh,
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.520]   what essentially they were doing unwittingly
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.140]   was remaining locked in their previous slavery.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.300]   And isn't it great that you and I
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.900]   are so free of all of those idols today?
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:12.460]   - I think what I say in that film
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.060]   is actually really important for us,
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.560]   that it's easy for us to settle with a half-baked freedom
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.700]   where we live divided between having elements
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.440]   of God's liberation on the one hand
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.640]   and yet still holding onto our slavery
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.300]   that we've been so accustomed to on the other.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.240]   And we find ourselves divided between these things.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.920]   And that division means
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.760]   that we live in this half-baked freedom.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.920]   We experience some of that great release of God,
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.480]   and yet we find ourselves so easily entangled still
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.800]   in the things that hold us back.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.200]   And what we see in Exodus 32
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.220]   is that the key to the things that hold us back
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.820]   is this thing called idolatry.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.120]   The second commandment, of course,
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.340]   that God gives Moses in chapter 20
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.360]   was to have no idols, no images.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.900]   And the very first thing that Israel does
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.240]   is that they take an image
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.520]   and they create it in order to worship.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.000]   And I wanna show you a few things in this
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.600]   because I think there's so much for us to learn
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.560]   in our hearts about what it is
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.280]   to be a believer, worshiper of God ourselves.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.840]   Let me read to you Exodus 32, verse one.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.480]   It says, "When the people saw that Moses was so long
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.140]   in coming down from the mountain,
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.640]   they gathered around Aaron and said,
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.920]   'Come, make us a God who will go before us.'
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.760]   And as for this fellow Moses,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.320]   who brought us up out of Egypt,
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.080]   we don't know what has happened to him."
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.780]   I want you to notice the thing
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.500]   that catalyzes God's people into idol worship.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.640]   It's seen right at the start.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.360]   It says, "When the people saw that Moses was so long
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.160]   in coming down from the mountain."
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.200]   We actually learn in Exodus 24
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.380]   that Moses was for 40 days and 40 nights up on the mountain.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.400]   40 days, 40 nights.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.720]   That's a pretty long period of time.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.040]   And Israel are waiting.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.800]   They thought he was gonna go up, meet with God,
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.860]   and come back down, maybe even in the same day.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.200]   But it's been 40 days and 40 nights
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.400]   and their expectations have not been met.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.260]   They're anxious about what's happened to Moses,
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.240]   their leader.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.520]   They're wondering what's going to happen in their future.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.820]   And it fascinates me that the triggers
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.440]   that cause them to move into idolatry
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.120]   is essentially unmet expectations and anxiety
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.060]   for the future.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.900]   And if you wanna think about what are the things
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.400]   that are gonna be the most that will trigger you
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.360]   into any form of idolatry in your life,
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.040]   it will be impatience, being out of control,
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.520]   not knowing what's gonna happen in your future,
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.620]   anxiety for what's ahead.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.760]   Those are the key catalysts that draw us
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.920]   to try to find something tangible,
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.440]   something we can trust,
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.800]   something that we can build our hope on
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.640]   when the thing that we were building our hope on
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.200]   seems so intangible, so distant, so out there,
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.040]   and we can't quite control it.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.320]   Are you with me?
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.440]   See, the core of idolatry is this desire to control.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.680]   Humanity is really bad at being out of control.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.240]   Well, this hasn't happened on the timeframe
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.080]   that I thought it was gonna happen on.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.080]   He's been up there so long.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.100]   I don't know when he's coming back,
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.560]   if he's gonna come back at all.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.200]   So we're gonna take matters into our own hands.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.360]   If you want to get a sense of what the idols
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.080]   might be in your life,
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.160]   look at what you turn to for comfort
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.340]   when you're anxious or disappointed.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.280]   Come on, church.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.280]   I wanna encourage you to do that this week.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.920]   That's gonna be a great devotional time
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.880]   for you and Jesus this week, okay?
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.240]   Have a think about what are the things
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.680]   that you are naturally turning to
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.360]   to find comfort and control and security
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.240]   when you're feeling anxious, disappointed,
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.440]   or your expectations have not been met,
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.800]   whether that's from your spouse,
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.040]   whether it's from your boss,
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.200]   whether it's from God.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.800]   Those things that we turn to to find stability
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.120]   when our life is not stable
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.040]   is very often the things that we turn into idols.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.280]   You follow that?
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.060]   Now, notice what happens here next.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.480]   It says here in this passage,
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.280]   this is what they say to Aaron, Israel.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.220]   They say, "Come, make us a God who will go before us."
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.600]   Now, this is fascinating.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.140]   The phrase will go before us is the first thing
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.360]   that shows us the first temptation
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.280]   that I think we are susceptible with here
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.580]   that disempowers us as a church.
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.280]   They say, "Make us a God who will go before us."
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.960]   That phrase, "who will go before us,"
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.600]   is a phrase that's been used a lot
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.280]   in the Exodus journey so far.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.040]   God's used that phrase about himself so many times.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.560]   You are my people.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.720]   I will go before you and prepare the way.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.040]   I will go before you and prepare a promised land
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.600]   that is flowing with milk and honey.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.080]   I will go before you as a pillar of cloud
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.760]   and as a fire during the day.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.720]   I will go before you has been a constant phrase
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.000]   that God has been speaking about the future,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.520]   the vision, the destiny,
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.680]   the purpose of where God wants to take Israel.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.500]   And it's fascinating to me
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.520]   that when Israel create a God to worship,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.960]   they use this phrase, "We want this God to go before us."
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.520]   In other words, we want this God to now achieve
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.640]   what this other God had set up for us.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.760]   You notice this?
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.280]   Now, this is really subtle.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.640]   It's really important
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.040]   because what Israel is doing
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.760]   out of their unmet expectations
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.320]   and out of their anxiety for their future,
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.640]   they're basically saying, "We have God's promise,
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.400]   "but we're not happy that that promise is not coming through
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.440]   "how we were expecting it to come through.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.300]   "So we're now going to do it in our way."
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.520]   This is the idolatry of the self.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.920]   This is saying that I am better
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.280]   than what God is going to do.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   But notice they still want what God wants.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.920]   So at its very,
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.360]   listen to this, church, this is really important.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.820]   At its very core, identity.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:06.600]   Identity is the decision in our lives
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.280]   to basically in the flesh accomplish something
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.480]   that God started in the spirit.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.960]   Come on, church.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.900]   That at its very heart is what idolatry is all about.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.000]   It is the desire and the decision
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.800]   to accomplish, to finish in our flesh
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.400]   something that God has started in His spirit.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.920]   And for some of us, it started well.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.600]   It started out, God spoke to us.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.320]   He gave us a call, He gave us a vision,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.360]   He gave us some hope.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.200]   And we began out of that place of the spirit
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.840]   to believe and to pray and to align our priorities
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.640]   towards the thing that God had said.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.700]   But over time, when our expectations got unmet,
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.080]   when we became anxious about our future,
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.480]   where things didn't seem to happen
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.240]   how we quite thought they were gonna happen,
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.280]   it is so tempting for us to finish in the flesh
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.840]   the thing that God started in the spirit.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.000]   It is very tempting for us to essentially create
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   an Ishmael process for an Isaac promise.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.360]   Are you with me?
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.840]   And this is exactly what they're doing here.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.280]   And they're doing it out of that place of fear,
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.920]   out of that place of not knowing,
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.840]   out of that uncomfortable, not being able to control,
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.800]   I'm gonna finish in my flesh
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.200]   what God has started in His spirit
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.080]   'cause I'm tired of waiting.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.160]   Some of you in this room,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.280]   you're trying to finish in your flesh
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.040]   something that God has promised you
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.760]   'cause you're upset that God hasn't done it
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.400]   in the way you thought it was going to be done.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.040]   This is not a new problem for the church.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.100]   This was a problem that existed
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.240]   right at the start of the church.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.400]   Paul, writing to the church in Galatia,
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.160]   he said it this way in Galatians 3.3.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.360]   Let me read this to you.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.120]   "Are you so foolish?
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.160]   "After beginning by means of the spirit,
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.080]   "are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?"
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.360]   See, the idolatry of self is one of the most
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.540]   powerful idolatries that the enemy brings the church.
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.640]   And I wanna, as your pastor, be honest with you about this.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.640]   This is the idolatry I see the most in me.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.760]   As your leader, the idolatry I see the most in me
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.680]   is me trying to finish in my flesh
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.520]   what God has begun here at the vine.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.880]   And I know, by the way, this week I'm celebrating,
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.200]   this week is the end of my 10th year as senior pastor here.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.440]   I became senior pastor November 1st, 2013.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.480]   And I know over those last 10 years
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.360]   that I have on a number of occasions
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.840]   created a golden calf and held it before you
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.800]   as I tried to finish in my flesh
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.000]   what God has started here in his spirit.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.440]   And I can tell you this from firsthand experience,
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.680]   it is exhausting to do that.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.840]   The irony is is that anxiety draws us
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.000]   into taking matters into our own hands.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.780]   But when you take the things of the spirit
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.440]   into your own hands and try to finish them in the flesh,
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.880]   it only creates more anxiety in you.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.480]   And see, the enemy's strategy over you is this.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.160]   He wants to disempower God's work in your life
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.600]   by turning the very good things of God
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.880]   that God has put in your life and started in your life
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.160]   and turn them into exhausting and tiring things
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.360]   through his work in you.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.920]   You know, it should sober us to realize
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.680]   that one of the great strategies of the enemy
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.640]   is actually to take the promises of God
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.600]   that are designed to set us free
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.960]   and through the worship of self,
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.640]   turn them into shackles that exhaust and bind us.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.080]   Listen to this, church.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.720]   This is what the enemy wants to do.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.960]   Take the very good promises of God,
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.100]   the things that God has put in us to set us free,
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.840]   and through the worship of self,
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.040]   through the driving of trying to achieve
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.160]   what only the spirit can achieve,
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.560]   we will essentially burn ourselves out.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.360]   And the very gifts and the promises of God
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.600]   become shackles that exhaust and bind us.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.200]   And if you feel a little bit like that today,
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.360]   right at the end of our time together,
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.920]   I'm gonna share something that I believe
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.560]   can help to set you free.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.800]   But I wanna show you the second great temptation.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.040]   Is this helpful still so far for some of you?
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.640]   Here's the second temptation.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.560]   Aaron then answered them.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.800]   Verse two, "Take off your gold earrings
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.640]   "that your wives, your sons, your daughters are wearing
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.760]   "and bring them to me."
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.440]   So all the people took off their earrings
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.480]   and brought them to Aaron.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.400]   He took what they had handed to him
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.560]   and he made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf,
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.320]   fashioning it with a tool.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.160]   Fascinating.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.880]   So Israel says, "We want an idol."
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.480]   Aaron, who's the de facto leader in Moses' absence says,
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.320]   "All right, well, take off all the earrings,
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.520]   "all the gold that you had taken from Egypt.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.080]   "Take that off, give it to me.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.200]   "I'm gonna melt it down.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.640]   "I'm gonna put it in this iron cast.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.600]   "I'm gonna create a golden calf."
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.000]   Essentially a bull, a young bull.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.560]   "I'm gonna create that and that's gonna become our idol."
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.080]   Now, the context to this is really important
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.920]   because back in Exodus 24,
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.640]   God had spoken from 25 to 27 and then 30 and 31,
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.680]   God had spoken to him about the creation of the tabernacle.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   And God had said to Moses,
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.240]   "We're gonna create this place of worship
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.760]   "called a tabernacle that the people are gonna come to
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.200]   "to be able to worship me."
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.800]   And he said, "In the construction of this tabernacle,
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.600]   "I want you to take the gold
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.200]   "that you had plundered from Egypt
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.760]   "and I want you to use that to shape a place of worship,
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.600]   "a tabernacle.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.960]   "And this tabernacle will be so glorious
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.480]   "because it will be filled with gold and jewels
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.080]   "and it will speak of my might and my power and my glory.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.960]   "It will be a reminder to you of the things
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.040]   "that I have done in Egypt
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.240]   "and the freedom I've brought you.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.120]   "This place of worship will lead you
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.800]   "into the ability to worship me.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.480]   "Take the gold and fashion a place of worship."
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.920]   Are you following that?
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.240]   Now, interestingly in the Hebrew,
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.720]   the very same word that Aaron uses here in 32
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.600]   for making and taking the gold and making the idol
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.360]   is the same word God uses in those chapters
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.080]   to talk about making a place of worship.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.280]   And in this, you see one of the most powerful,
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.200]   one of the most destructive idolatries
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.640]   that can happen in the church today.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.480]   And this is it.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.560]   It happens when we take our place of worship
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.320]   and turn it into our object of worship.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.360]   Oh, I'm gonna have to preach on this one for a moment.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.360]   In taking the gold that should have been put aside
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.840]   for the creation of a place of worship,
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.000]   Israel takes that gold and they fashion a calf
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.280]   as an object of worship.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.120]   And when we as a church today take the very thing
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.200]   that was created by God as a place of worship,
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.040]   a place that makes us come so that we can worship Yahweh,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.760]   and we twist it and turn it
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.400]   and we make the place an object of worship,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.160]   then we've entered into one of the most destructive forms
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.560]   of idolatry there is,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.720]   and we have disempowered the church
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.200]   for its witness in the world.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.760]   So when we come in here on a Sunday
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.720]   and we come in with the intention
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.000]   of enjoying experience together,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.600]   which is higher and more valuable to us
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.640]   than the God behind that experience,
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.240]   we've entered into idolatry.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.800]   When we come in here excited to sing songs
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.000]   and to worship together
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.760]   and to fill an experience of worship together
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.440]   that we think is better than anything else
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.560]   that we've ever experienced,
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.280]   and we come excited for that experience of worship,
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.800]   and we don't think about the God behind that worship,
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.360]   we have entered into idolatry.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.880]   When we come in here and we pay lip service to our sin,
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.480]   when we ignore the conviction of sin
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.280]   that God brings into our heart
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.560]   through our ability to gather into worship like this,
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.240]   when God speaks to us and we pay lip service to it,
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.400]   and we don't really react to it,
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.600]   we don't really respond to it,
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.800]   we don't really repent to it,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.960]   we've entered into idolatry.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.240]   We've made the place of worship our object of worship.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:07.480]   I believe that the church is God's gift to change a world,
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.240]   but let me be really clear about this,
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.420]   there is no power in this building.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.320]   There is no power in the chairs you're sitting in,
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.600]   in this lights that you see here,
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.240]   there's no power in the skill of our musicians,
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.920]   there's no power in the words that come from my mouth.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.120]   The only power that there is, is the power of Jesus.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.680]   And if we come into church and we fail to worship
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.640]   where the power truly lies,
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.280]   and we worship a subset of that power,
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.720]   and we in our human sin make the subset of the power,
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.560]   the power that gets to be worshiped,
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.560]   then we need to repent.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.600]   Then we are so caught up in idolatry
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.640]   that we have disempowered the effectiveness of the church.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.320]   They take the gold and they fasten an object of worship
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.000]   when they should have been using that gold
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.600]   to create a place of worship.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.600]   Let me encourage you with this,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.800]   take the gold that is inside of you
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.560]   and create a place of worship.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.600]   Here's the third thing.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.800]   They say at the end here in verse four,
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.520]   then they said this, "This is your God, O Israel,
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.160]   "who brought you up out of Egypt."
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.400]   This is really fascinating to me.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.160]   The third thing they do in this process of idolatry
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.040]   is that once the golden calf is then presented
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.160]   before the people, they say these words
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.360]   to the whole of Israel, "This is your God."
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.920]   And they actually then define who this God is.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.000]   They say, "This is the God who brought us up out of Egypt."
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.040]   Now this is really interesting
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.160]   because the God that brought them up out of Egypt
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.080]   is what God?
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.720]   Yahweh.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.000]   Yahweh has brought them out of Egypt.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.280]   So they present this calf and notice what they do.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   They present this calf
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.840]   as the physical earthly representation of Yahweh,
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.680]   which is really interesting
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.760]   'cause we think idolatry by its definition
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.320]   is the exchange of worship of one God
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.080]   for the worship of a completely different God.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.720]   But actually the most destructive and subtle
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.240]   and most powerful form of idolatry
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.000]   is not exchanging the worship of Yahweh
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.520]   for the worship of something else.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:21.520]   It is reducing who Yahweh is into a golden calf.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.160]   They've said, "This is the God who brought us out of Egypt."
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.760]   Well, we're not comfortable.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.360]   We're not happy with God being distant
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.240]   and in a cloud on a mountain.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.440]   We want a God who we can see, who we can physically hold,
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.520]   who we can reduce down into something that we can understand.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.320]   We wanna domesticate God, Israel says.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.200]   And the greatest idolatry that happens in the church today
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.040]   is the domestication of God.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.440]   It is fashioning a God who fits within our comfort levels.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:58.000]   And when we fashion a God who fits within our comfort levels,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   we have basically exchanged God for a changed God.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.120]   For over 15 chapters,
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.480]   God has been showing himself to Israel
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.600]   in might and power, in the plagues,
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.360]   most of them which weren't pretty
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.720]   and were quite uncomfortable,
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.960]   in the reality of the parting of the sea,
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.520]   and a God who can hold all creation in his hands.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.720]   And then they come to Mount Sinai to personally meet with God
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.200]   and now they witness a God who's thunder and lightning,
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.920]   who shakes the ground around them,
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.480]   who Moses goes up and disappears into a cloud
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.160]   and is up there for 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.600]   And in all of that, Israel is thinking to themselves,
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.200]   "I'm not sure I can handle this kind of God.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.040]   I'm not sure if I fully understand this kind of God.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.480]   This God is not controllable.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.200]   This God is somewhat unpredictable.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.520]   This God is so powerful
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.240]   that it is beyond my understanding of what power is
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.600]   and I'm not comfortable with that.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.800]   So I will take the gold and I will fashion God down
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.320]   into something that I can comfortably understand,
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.960]   grasp, control."
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.360]   The greatest idolatry you will ever do
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.280]   is to recast God into something you can handle.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   God is not to be handled, he's to be worshiped.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.800]   Come on, church.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.160]   And if we at the Vine, if we do our best
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.840]   to try to place God into some comfortable box
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.320]   that we've always known Him in,
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.760]   in the last 30 years of our existence as a church,
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.760]   God is constantly wanting to try and break out
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.760]   of the expectations and the molds that his people put Him in.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.720]   That doesn't mean that we can't know Christ.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.440]   Of course we can know Him and we can see His character
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.520]   and we can trust what the Word says about Him.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.000]   We can find ourselves rooted in comfortable ideas
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.760]   of theology and knowing who He is.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.320]   All that is absolutely true.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.360]   But the temptation the church has,
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.360]   what I think the enemy does in trying to push the church
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.360]   is to say, "We want a God who is always comfortable."
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.040]   One of my favorite theologians and writers
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.880]   in the 21st century is C.S. Lewis.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.520]   If you've never read any of C.S. Lewis's stuff,
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.160]   I can't recommend it more.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.000]   There's this incredible book that he wrote,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.840]   one of his most famous,
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.520]   "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.840]   where he writes about these children
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.760]   who find this wardrobe in their uncle's house
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.840]   and they go through it into this incredible land
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.200]   called Narnia where there's a fight
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.160]   between good and evil happening.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.680]   C.S. Lewis writes it in such a way
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.880]   to present what the kingdom of God is like.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.640]   There's a lion in this particular Narnia
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.280]   who is the representation of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.880]   Then there's all these other animals who talk.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.160]   It's a fantasy thing.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.180]   There's all the animals that talk.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.000]   These three children go into that land
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.560]   and they discover a world that they didn't know.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.800]   There's this one moment where Susan, one of the children,
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.760]   is talking to a beaver.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.600]   The beaver's talking.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.400]   Yes, it's fantasy.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.560]   And they're talking together.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.600]   I want to read this part to you.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.480]   It says this.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.960]   This is the beaver speaking.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.640]   As then is a lion, the lion, the great lion.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.240]   Oh, said Susan, I thought he was a man.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.200]   Is he quite safe?
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.520]   I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.120]   Safe, said Mr. Beaver.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.680]   Who said anything about safe?
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.600]   Of course he isn't safe, but he's good.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.440]   He's the king, I tell you.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.960]   When a church tries to domesticate God
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   and make him safe, we've made a golden calf.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.680]   He's not safe, but he is good.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:22.600]   And his goodness, his goodness is what changes a city,
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.120]   not his safeness.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.200]   God is not Gandalf on a cloud.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.620]   He's a refining fire in our hearts.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.780]   That's who he is.
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:35.520]   And so these three things, these three temptations
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.820]   towards idol worship that I think every church faces,
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:44.440]   the temptation to exchange God, to change him
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.320]   and to make him into a way that we understand him,
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.920]   the temptation to finish in the flesh
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.440]   what God has started in his spirit,
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.800]   the temptation to think that we are the ones
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.400]   that can accomplish it and not him,
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.960]   these temptations that sit behind us
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.920]   and with us all the time.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.640]   We have to purge these from us.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.280]   If we're truly going to be a church
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.520]   that can change our city.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.880]   And the question we have to ask is where's the hope?
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.600]   Where's the hope in this?
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.280]   Well, the hope in chapter 32 is that Moses
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.080]   sees what's happening and God shows him
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.240]   what's happening in the idolatry.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.600]   And Moses petitions and intercedes with God
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.980]   and God changes his heart and doesn't do
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.880]   what he said he's gonna do to his people.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.280]   We don't have time to look at that today,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.920]   but we have one more powerful than Moses
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.040]   that is standing in the gap for us in our idolatry
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.760]   and that's Jesus.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.720]   And Jesus comes before the Lord on behalf
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.280]   of the church today and intercedes on our behalf
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.120]   and stands in the gap for us and says
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.340]   that I am the only image you will ever need.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.400]   That in Jesus Christ who has become flesh for us,
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.840]   he has shown us the fullness of who God is.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.360]   And while there is still mystery and wonder
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.400]   and power and the unimaginable that is in God,
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.480]   which is a beautiful thing, in Christ,
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.480]   we get to see what God is truly like.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.020]   God is saying, I understand that you need something
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.560]   that is tangible to you.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.720]   So the incarnation, fully God, fully human,
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.040]   is the most tangible expression
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.320]   that we could ever have of God.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.480]   We no longer need the idols of golden calves
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.840]   because we have the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.120]   And when Paul speaks of that hope to the church,
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.920]   he is trying to shift them from their idol
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.760]   worshiping temptations that are there to disempower them
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.040]   and set up for them a worshiping,
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.200]   Jesus-centric church community.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.760]   And I wanna finish by showing you his vision
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.440]   of such a community.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.440]   This is found from Colossians 1:15.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.840]   He, speaking of Jesus, is the image,
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.960]   notice how he talks about it,
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.440]   is the image of the invisible God,
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.440]   the firstborn over all creation.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.320]   For by him, all things were created,
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.840]   things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.240]   whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.600]   all things were created by him and for him.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.920]   He is before all things,
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.360]   and in him all the things hold together.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.480]   And he is the head of the body, that's the church.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.200]   He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead,
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.960]   and that in everything he might have the supremacy.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.040]   For God was pleased to have, notice this,
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.560]   his fullness dwell in him,
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.080]   and through him to reconcile to himself all things,
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.400]   whether things on earth or things in heaven,
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.160]   by making peace through the blood shed on the cross.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.480]   Once you were alienated from God
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.720]   and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.920]   but now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.800]   through death to present you holy, notice this,
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.480]   in his sight without blemish and free from accusation.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.120]   That's our hope being freed from idolatry,
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.040]   that we can stand before Christ because of Christ,
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.480]   holy in his sight without blemish and free from accusation.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.240]   If you continue in your faith, established firm,
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.400]   not moved by the hope held out in the gospel.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.240]   This is the gospel that you heard
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.720]   and that has been proclaimed to you,
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.480]   every creature under heaven,
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.720]   and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.640]   In other words, Paul's saying, see Jesus.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.840]   If you want an idol, if you want an image,
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.120]   if you wanna look towards something that's tangible,
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.600]   see Christ because in Christ,
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.760]   he has reconciled all things to himself
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.080]   and if the church lays down its worship of worship,
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.480]   its worship of preaching,
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.160]   its worship of being relevant in the world
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.400]   and turns back to the worship of Jesus,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.520]   we will find where the power truly lies
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.840]   to change the city that we so long for.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.720]   Oh, I love the church
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.340]   but I also recognize the way in which the enemy is at work,
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.680]   even against us here at the Vine.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.180]   May we, as individuals and as a community,
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:02.000]   deal with the idols that we're tempted to embrace
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.100]   and as we come to Christ to deal with those idols,
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.320]   may he empower us for the work that he has for us.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.720]   Would you stand with me?
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.320]   And I wanna pray over you
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.760]   and I wanna commission you into this work
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.300]   and maybe if you're comfortable,
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.280]   you could just open your hands as I pray for you.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:25.920]   Father, in this room,
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.300]   there are many things that we hold in our hearts
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.140]   in this moment.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:37.320]   Those things are on the individual level in every heart
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.680]   and those things are on the community level
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.840]   within the church body.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.760]   And Lord, we're grateful for this community of faith,
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.600]   for the Vine.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.420]   And we're grateful that you've called us
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.920]   to be community together here.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:55.180]   We're grateful for every person in this room
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.480]   that calls the Vine their home church in Hong Kong.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.940]   And Father, we believe in the power of the church,
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.020]   not in the power of a building,
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.260]   in the power of programs,
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.660]   in the power of Jesus Christ
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.320]   who is alive in the church today.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.660]   And Father, we want that power to be seen in Hong Kong
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.940]   in this time, in this hour like never before.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.340]   Lord, we pray that you would purge your church.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.760]   Lord, that's a powerful prayer.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.460]   We pray that you would purge the Vine
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.900]   of the idols that it holds,
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.780]   that you would show me and the other leaders here
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.900]   what those idols are
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.100]   and bring us to our knees in repentance.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.380]   You would show our elders what those idols are
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.740]   and you would bring the elders to their knees in repentance.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.540]   You would show individuals in this church
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.020]   what those idols are
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.220]   and that they would humbly submit them
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.340]   to the leadership here to repent and pray through.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.660]   Father, we come corporately to you in this moment,
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.220]   recognizing that we are sinners
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.620]   and therefore there is idolatry amongst us.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.540]   But recognizing your grace and your goodness,
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:12.340]   that we can stand before you, as the scriptures say,
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.900]   without blemish or accusation.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.740]   Thank you for the blood on the cross of Jesus
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:19.980]   that does that for us.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:24.060]   And Father, I pray for every individual here too.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:28.540]   And I want you to take a moment just between you and God
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.340]   to allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:34.380]   of any personal idols that you may hold.
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:39.700]   And as he shows you these things,
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:40.660]   it's not to condemn you,
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.620]   it's to invite you into great freedom.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:46.060]   It's perhaps to even pull back the curtain
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.660]   and reveal to you a way in which the enemy
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:48.740]   is trying to hold you back
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.820]   from all that God has promised for you.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.140]   And our individual idols
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.340]   are things that we now bring to God in knowledge
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.780]   that in Christ, in his death and resurrection,
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:05.860]   we find freedom, that we can repent.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.860]   I wanna invite you into a place of repentance this morning.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.460]   (gentle music)
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.140]   Let's not pay lip service
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.780]   to what the Holy Spirit shows us individually today.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.900]   Take a moment.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.580]   All you have to do is say,
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.220]   "Lord, I bring this thing of my life to you,
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.740]   "and I don't know how to handle it.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.060]   "I don't know how to finish it.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.100]   "I don't know what to do, Lord, but I confess it,
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.220]   "and I ask you to take it from me.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.100]   "I ask that you forgive me for the idolatry
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.100]   "that I'm holding in this particular place
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.220]   "in my life right now."
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.820]   (gentle music)
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:44.220]   Come, Holy Spirit, come.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.740]   Cleanse your church.
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:52.780]   Purge us, Lord, of the things that shackle and bind us again,
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.660]   things that drag us back into slavery.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:58.100]   Come, Jesus, come.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.140]   Jesus, come.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.740]   (gentle music)
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.240]   (music fades)
