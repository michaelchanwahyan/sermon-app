1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 (audience applauding)

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,840
 - That's great.

3
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,040
 As you sit down, why don't you say hi

4
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,320
 to the person next to you, say hey.

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,320
 That was a really beautiful moment I just shared with you.

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,160
 Who are you?

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,080
 So good.

8
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,760
 Well, welcome to The Vine.

9
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,680
 My name's Andrew.

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,880
 I'm one of the pastors here,

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,120
 and we are so glad you are here with us.

12
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,040
 And we're in week five of our Exodus series here,

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,000
 and in week five, at the end of chapter two,

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,940
 everything changes.

15
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,060
 In fact, this is a turning point

16
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,460
 in the whole of the story of Exodus

17
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,340
 that we're looking at today.

18
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,500
 This is a moment where God steps in

19
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,540
 and does what only God can do.

20
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,300
 And just in that song that we've just been singing

21
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,580
 and that desire that we have for God

22
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,120
 to fight battles for us, God to come through for us,

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,260
 this is the moment in the story where God reveals himself.

24
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,440
 And in revealing himself,

25
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,780
 he creates for his people renewed hope.

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,560
 I told you in week one of this series

27
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,760
 that the book of Exodus is provided to us

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,560
 and is shaped for us in five movements.

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,320
 And those movements are slavery,

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
 promise, liberation, identity, and home.

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,440
 And over the last four weeks,

32
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,520
 we've been immersed in the slavery aspect

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,280
 of those five movements.

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,400
 We've been looking at the reality of slavery,

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,800
 and we've been looking at it, yes,

36
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,480
 in terms of what the scriptures tell us about Egypt

37
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,560
 and about Israel and the slavery that they're going through.

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,240
 But more than that, we've been focusing on stepping back

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,300
 and saying, what about our slavery?

40
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,280
 What about our brokenness?

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,680
 What about the stuff that we're dealing with?

42
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,640
 And how do these two things create and come together?

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,400
 And we've been seeing for Israel, so also for us,

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,800
 that slavery is a total thing.

45
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
 Slavery is completely holistic.

46
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,000
 We saw in week two how slavery

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,760
 was not just physical for the Israelites,

48
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,960
 but it was physical, emotional, social, spiritual.

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,520
 And it's the same for us,

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,800
 that our slavery to sin

51
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,180
 doesn't just impact our spiritual lives,

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,720
 it impacts everything that we are, everything that we do,

53
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,960
 the totality of who we are, our relationships,

54
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,740
 what we do in our workplaces,

55
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,480
 how we are in our city and our neighborhoods.

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,920
 All of that is impacted by the realities

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,280
 of the slavery of our sin.

58
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,420
 And over the last four weeks,

59
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,160
 we've seen some pretty tough stuff.

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,000
 Just last week, we saw Moses fall

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,800
 into a place of disruption and disorientation,

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,960
 having worn for far too long the wrong identities,

63
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,680
 the wrong clothes of who he truly was,

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,560
 wrestling with the reality of,

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,620
 am I an Egyptian or am I a Hebrew?

66
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,720
 Am I an oppressor or am I a part of the oppressed?

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,380
 And we saw last week that God comes

68
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,520
 and begins to stir something in his heart.

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,600
 And all of our journeys from slavery to freedom

70
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,240
 starts because God begins to burn something,

71
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,080
 turn something, do something in our hearts.

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
 And Moses' heart begins to change

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,040
 and he looks out on his people.

74
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,180
 And although he had been looking out on them for 40 years,

75
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,680
 on this particular day, he looks out

76
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,480
 and something changes, he sees them differently.

77
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,600
 And because he sees them differently,

78
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,160
 he decides he wants to react.

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,760
 But we saw last week how he reacts.

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,960
 He ends up murdering an Egyptian

81
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,020
 who's abusing one of his people.

82
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,760
 And we look at this and we can see

83
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,040
 Moses has the right heart, but he has the wrong method.

84
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,480
 He has the right kind of desire,

85
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,360
 but he has the wrong idea on how to put that together

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,460
 because slavery to sin has so immersed him

87
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,560
 that his identities are so broken

88
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
 that he doesn't know how to react and respond

89
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
 to what it is that God is doing in him.

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,280
 And in this rightful heart to wanna be a deliverer,

91
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,320
 he ends up committing the sin of murder.

92
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,620
 And we saw last week that Pharaoh finds out about this

93
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,760
 and Pharaoh is so angry, so upset.

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,000
 We might think, well, why?

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,240
 It's because Moses had been adopted into Pharaoh's family.

96
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,680
 This wasn't just a tiff between two leaders

97
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,600
 of different nations.

98
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,640
 This was a brokenness within a family.

99
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,220
 And the very one who was hoping to raise Moses

100
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,280
 to take over as Pharaoh, now that one wants to kill Moses.

101
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,860
 And Moses is so broken by this,

102
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,200
 he's so torn up by all of this,

103
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,200
 that in fear of his life, he flees from Egypt

104
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,120
 and he goes all the way over as far as he can

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,320
 through the desert to a place called Midian.

106
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,840
 And we're gonna talk a little bit more next week

107
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,440
 as we come to the burning bush.

108
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,200
 I can't wait to come to the burning bush next week.

109
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,440
 We're gonna look all about Midian then,

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,440
 but in Midian, Moses finds himself disjointed,

111
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,800
 disorientated, he's a wreck of a man.

112
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,320
 He's dealing with all this stuff

113
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,000
 that's happening in his identity.

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,300
 And it's almost as if we're traveling

115
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,360
 through the first two chapters of this movement of Exodus

116
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,020
 and we can see how completely oppressive slavery is.

117
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,680
 And that oppression is so deep that Moses flees

118
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,280
 and finds himself completely turned upside down.

119
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,680
 And he realizes something that we all have to realize

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,420
 in our own journeys of Exodus.

121
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,560
 And that's that we can't save ourselves.

122
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,260
 We're not the ones who are able to free us from our sin.

123
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,120
 We're not the ones that can free our people.

124
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,040
 We come to this realization that actually

125
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,480
 we need something outside of ourselves,

126
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,600
 something bigger than us, something more powerful than us

127
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,360
 to step in and change the situation that we cannot change.

128
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
 And when we try to change it like Moses did,

129
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,100
 we only often fall more and more into sin.

130
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,440
 Our own human effort can never create salvation for us.

131
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,480
 And so Moses sitting at this well in Midian,

132
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,800
 the wreck of a man, realizes that there has

133
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,600
 to be something more.

134
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,960
 There has to be something outside of himself

135
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,200
 and he's longing for a promise.

136
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,200
 He's longing to get a promise that God will come through.

137
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,960
 And I sense in this room this morning,

138
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,240
 and for those that are joining us online,

139
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
 there's a lot of people here who are longing for a promise.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,040
 Oh God, speak to me.

141
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,640
 God, say something to me.

142
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,840
 Give me a promise that everything's gonna be okay.

143
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,440
 And you have to understand that the journey of Exodus

144
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,800
 always begins with the coming of a promise.

145
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,440
 The beginning of Exodus always begins

146
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,060
 with a coming of a promise.

147
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,080
 And as bad as slavery has been, a promise now comes.

148
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,220
 And when God brings a promise,

149
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,960
 just like I said a few moments ago,

150
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,400
 nothing can hold it back.

151
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,320
 And I wanna show you the beauty of the coming of a promise.

152
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,720
 This is the last part of Exodus chapter two.

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,120
 During that long period, remember Moses is writing,

154
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,680
 during that long period, the king of Egypt, Pharaoh, died.

155
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,380
 The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out.

156
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,280
 And their cry to help because of their slavery

157
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,900
 went up to God.

158
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,440
 God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant

159
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,240
 with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

160
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,360
 And so God looked on the Israelites

161
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,580
 and was concerned about them.

162
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,600
 Just a few verses in the Bible here,

163
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,160
 but this is a turning point in everything

164
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,200
 that is about to happen next in Exodus.

165
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,960
 And I want you to see how cheeky Moses is

166
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,000
 right at the start here.

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,880
 He once again skips over 40 years of his life.

168
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,440
 He starts with during that long period,

169
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,720
 and then he basically just goes through it.

170
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,760
 Remember last week we saw that Moses basically skips

171
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
 from when he's a baby in the waters of the Nile

172
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,020
 to when he kills the Egyptian.

173
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,960
 He just basically skips over 40 years of his life.

174
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,280
 He does it again right here.

175
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,840
 It's almost like he's saying, man, Midian was rough.

176
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,680
 Midian was tough.

177
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,640
 We're just gonna skip over all of that stuff.

178
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,480
 So basically now Moses is like 80 years old

179
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,160
 as he's writing this.

180
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,640
 And Pharaoh has died.

181
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,120
 And you can almost get a sense as Moses is writing this

182
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,120
 that Israel themselves may have risen up in hope.

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,760
 Pharaoh's died.

184
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
 Maybe the next person that comes in

185
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,520
 will be more benevolent.

186
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,240
 Maybe the next person that comes in might free us.

187
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,840
 And before we get carried away

188
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,240
 that when there's a change in authority,

189
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,160
 we think that there's gonna be a change in slavery.

190
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
 Notice what it says here.

191
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,760
 It says the Israelites groaned in their slavery

192
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,800
 and they cried out.

193
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,040
 In other words, there was no change here.

194
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,520
 The slavery has continued.

195
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,980
 And I want you to get your head around this.

196
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,600
 Moses has left Egypt.

197
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,440
 He's in Midian and he's actually started a new life there.

198
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,860
 He's free.

199
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,540
 He gets married.

200
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,600
 He starts having kids.

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,040
 This guy's living the life.

202
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,520
 He learns to become a shepherd.

203
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,920
 All the while for 40 years,

204
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,120
 his people are still suffering.

205
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,520
 His people are still locked in slavery.

206
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,480
 His people are still bound by oppression and injustice.

207
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,960
 And Moses is over here and his people are here.

208
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,180
 No doubt Moses skips over those 40 years.

209
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,600
 Because he wants us to understand

210
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,600
 that despite this kind of conflict

211
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,280
 between Moses seemingly living a life here

212
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,880
 and his people still in slavery,

213
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,160
 God has not given up on them.

214
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,520
 - Right.

215
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,160
 - And the people need a promise more than ever before.

216
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,560
 It says here that they are groaning and crying out.

217
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,240
 These two words, very important,

218
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,720
 could not be more different.

219
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,740
 The word for groaning, the Hebrew word,

220
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,700
 it literally means to sigh.

221
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,820
 I wonder if any of you have ever done that

222
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,260
 about something in your life.

223
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,400
 To groan, it means two things in the Hebrew.

224
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,680
 It means something that was personal and private

225
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,760
 and something that was done off the back of great pain.

226
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,480
 That classic, (groans)

227
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,840
 is exactly what it means here.

228
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,400
 And it's something that's personal and private,

229
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,020
 which is really interesting because Moses,

230
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,680
 in describing the slavery of his people

231
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,280
 and the pain that they're under at this time,

232
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,860
 he starts with the individual

233
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,800
 and the personal and the private.

234
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
 He starts with the reality that slavery

235
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,820
 was actually hurting them personally.

236
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,920
 A few years ago, I was playing golf, about 15 years ago,

237
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,760
 and I'm on the 15th tee, and my game's going great.

238
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,240
 And I've got my driver in my hand,

239
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,280
 I'm looking down the fairway,

240
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,720
 and I'm thinking this is gonna go long and straight.

241
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,560
 If you ever play golf with me,

242
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,800
 you know that that's not how I play golf.

243
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,320
 But anyway, just roll with it.

244
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,700
 And as I go back like this,

245
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,280
 I do something with the lower back.

246
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,160
 I don't know what I did.

247
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
 I've done that motion many, many times in my life.

248
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
 Something tweaked in my lower back.

249
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,220
 I literally had to go on the ground,

250
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,080
 and I had to lie there.

251
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,500
 I couldn't finish the round.

252
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,440
 For about two weeks,

253
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,800
 I had the most excruciating pain in my lower back.

254
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
 And since that day, for 15 years,

255
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,500
 every day I still have a dull pain in my back.

256
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,760
 I groan a lot about my pain in my back.

257
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,660
 Almost constantly.

258
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,120
 You guys probably won't know this,

259
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,180
 but in private, on my own, I'm like,

260
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,180
 I want you to resonate with this.

261
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,500
 What is it in your life that you groan about,

262
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,220
 that you find so hard to shake,

263
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,700
 and that you have almost kind of given into

264
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,860
 with that eternal sigh?

265
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,020
 Now, this word is then contrasted

266
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,660
 with this other word, cry out.

267
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,220
 Now, you could not get a whole completely different idea

268
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,580
 in the Hebrew than this groaning,

269
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,100
 which was private and individual,

270
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,660
 and ugh, and a cry out,

271
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,460
 which was public and communal and loud.

272
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,980
 In fact, that word literally can be translated shriek.

273
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,900
 So there's this personal reality

274
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,520
 for the Israelites in their slavery,

275
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,600
 where they're feeling something,

276
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,480
 and it's like, ugh, this burden of this pain.

277
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,820
 And yet together, they are coming together,

278
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,820
 and they have not given up crying out for change.

279
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,680
 Now, this is really important.

280
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,880
 You see this because this is the reality

281
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,120
 for Israel right here.

282
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,360
 They are shrieking.

283
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,800
 They are crying out.

284
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,320
 They're asking God to step in

285
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,800
 and change things and do things.

286
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
 They are asking.

287
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,640
 The word literally means to call out in hope of response.

288
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,720
 So they're not just going like, ah, life sucks.

289
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,840
 They're actually going, this is not right.

290
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,560
 This is not how I want things to be.

291
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,400
 This shouldn't be the people of God.

292
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,840
 We're crying out, God.

293
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,160
 We're asking you, God, to step in, to do something.

294
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,520
 We will not give in privately.

295
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,440
 We're groaning publicly.

296
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,280
 We're joining our voices together

297
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,800
 and saying the world should be a different place.

298
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,520
 We shouldn't be under this oppression.

299
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,880
 We shouldn't be facing what it is that we're facing.

300
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,480
 We will cry out.

301
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
 Now, this is shocking

302
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,880
 because Israel has been in slavery,

303
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,720
 by this time, for 100 years.

304
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,840
 This is not like me when I pray something for God

305
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,440
 and after a month, he doesn't answer and I just give up.

306
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,640
 This is 100 years of slavery.

307
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,480
 This is probably already four generations of Israelites

308
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,880
 that have come and gone in that time.

309
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,880
 And even after 100 years, they have not given up.

310
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,600
 Even after 100 years,

311
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,800
 they are still crying out in their slavery,

312
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,720
 asking God to come through.

313
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,520
 And the reality for all of us

314
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,080
 is that this should shake us up.

315
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,240
 This should change our thinking

316
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,320
 because it's so easy for us to get comfortable in our sin.

317
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,720
 And when we get comfortable in our sin,

318
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,000
 we silence the voice that should be crying out for change.

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,160
 Have you silenced a voice in you

320
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,560
 that should be crying out for change?

321
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,120
 One of the realities is that

322
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,480
 we become comfortable in our sin.

323
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,040
 As we become comfortable in our sin,

324
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,040
 we become comfortable in how things are.

325
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,480
 And that voice that was once inside of us

326
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,440
 has now come down.

327
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,880
 And that urgent desire that we've had before,

328
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,200
 to be holy before God, to walk with him,

329
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,840
 to do as much as we can has gone.

330
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,800
 And the reality is this.

331
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,800
 Some of us have silenced the cry of our soul for freedom.

332
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,960
 Come on, church.

333
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,800
 I need you to lean into this a little bit.

334
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
 'Cause I think this is really important for all of us here.

335
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,200
 Some of us have silenced the cry of our soul

336
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,800
 for liberation from our sin.

337
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,560
 And Israel are crying, shrieking,

338
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,080
 asking, pounding, believing,

339
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,520
 shouting as loud as they can all together

340
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,880
 for God to step in and do something.

341
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,480
 And I believe for some of you in this room,

342
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,280
 you need to rediscover your voice.

343
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,120
 You need to rediscover your cry.

344
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,040
 You need to draw a line in the sand and say,

345
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,440
 enough is enough.

346
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,600
 I'm gonna stand up.

347
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,640
 I'm gonna take a stand.

348
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,560
 I'm gonna ask God.

349
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
 I'm not gonna suppress it.

350
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,520
 Yes, maybe I haven't seen the freedom.

351
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,560
 Yes, maybe it seems like God has been distant.

352
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,560
 Yes, maybe the promise hasn't come through.

353
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,240
 It feels like God hasn't answered.

354
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,520
 He hasn't seen, but I will not silence my voice of hope.

355
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
 I will not silence my voice of prayer.

356
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,080
 I will not give in to the reality of my sin,

357
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,760
 but I will take a stand and say, enough is enough.

358
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,960
 I will cry out.

359
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,560
 Some of you need to start crying out again.

360
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,040
 And we can see in the text here

361
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,680
 that Israel has remembered their God.

362
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,880
 The question in the text though

363
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,600
 is has God remembered them?

364
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,560
 Is God present with his people when they cry out?

365
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,080
 Does God draw near to us when we have a voice

366
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,400
 in our soul that says, I want more freedom?

367
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,880
 I want you to see what happens in the text.

368
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,360
 Just a very small thing that Moses writes here.

369
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,200
 He says, the king has died.

370
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,880
 The Israelites groaned in their slave and cried out,

371
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,880
 and their cry for help because of their slavery

372
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,640
 went up to God.

373
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,720
 This was not some random cry.

374
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,200
 This was not just lots of words in a vacuum.

375
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,840
 These words went up to God,

376
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,160
 and this is the first introduction

377
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,600
 to a personal reality of God.

378
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,560
 God's been mentioned in the Exodus so far,

379
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,640
 but this is the first time where God is about to step in

380
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,360
 and actually introduce himself, show us who he is.

381
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
 And like we say, next week we're gonna see

382
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,200
 the personal intimacy of that God

383
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,680
 as he meets Moses in Midian,

384
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,040
 but in this moment, God begins to express himself

385
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,280
 through his heart, through his soul,

386
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,440
 through his character, through his emotions,

387
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,560
 through who he is, and mostly through his promise

388
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,040
 and his promise for his people.

389
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,920
 And it's this idea of God's character

390
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,560
 that is now going to define the rest of the Exodus journey.

391
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,040
 In fact, from this point forward,

392
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,680
 all the way through the next 38 chapters or so,

393
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,840
 God always refers back to this moment right here.

394
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,680
 He always comes back and says, this is who I am.

395
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,920
 I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

396
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,720
 I am this, I am that.

397
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,160
 You need to know my character.

398
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,240
 You need to know my heart,

399
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,280
 because you are a people who are shaped by my character.

400
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,720
 And when we're shaped by the character of God,

401
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,880
 God's promises become our promises.

402
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,240
 God's word becomes our word.

403
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,720
 God's work and mission becomes our mission.

404
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,200
 When he says, pray that heaven will come to earth,

405
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
 God was looking at the church.

406
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,400
 And we align ourselves to the character of God.

407
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,840
 That's the thing that enables us

408
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,480
 to journey into freedom from our Exodus.

409
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,840
 And we're gonna see a lot of that as we go,

410
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,960
 but today I wanna open up this idea

411
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,800
 of the character of God with you.

412
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,880
 I want you to see why God acts on behalf of his people.

413
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,760
 What is it inside of him?

414
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,360
 What is it about his compassion

415
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,280
 that drives him to respond on behalf of his people?

416
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,200
 When we were in Egypt, that was a question

417
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,280
 that was going around my mind

418
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,440
 whilst we were filming this series.

419
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,200
 I was always asking myself, what was it?

420
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,680
 What was it in God's heart?

421
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,560
 What was it that caused God

422
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,520
 to wanna have this response for his people?

423
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,240
 What makes God fight the battles

424
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,880
 that he fights for his people?

425
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,840
 And as we were there, we had a chance to connect

426
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,240
 with somebody in Egypt.

427
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,440
 His name's Akram.

428
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
 He's an NGO worker.

429
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,000
 He runs an organization called Better for Kids.

430
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,240
 And he works with orphans in Egypt.

431
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,760
 And I wanted to sit down with him

432
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,520
 and find out a little bit more about his heart

433
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,840
 and why he serves and why he does what he does

434
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,160
 on behalf of others,

435
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
 hoping that I might encounter something

436
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,440
 about God's heart in what he does.

437
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,680
 And so I sat down with him.

438
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,960
 We did an interview.

439
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,360
 We're gonna play that for you now.

440
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,200
 I wanna just encourage you though to lean into this,

441
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,120
 to really open your ears of both your heart

442
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,040
 and your head to hear this.

443
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,960
 Akram's English is not the strongest English.

444
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,400
 And so you do need to kind of just listen in.

445
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,480
 But he's got some incredible nuggets

446
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,640
 for us to understand about the heart of God in compassion.

447
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,680
 Let's check this out.

448
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,800
 I've come here to the bustling city of Cairo today

449
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,880
 to the local offices of an NGO

450
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,040
 called Better for Kids International

451
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,160
 to meet with one of their staff called Akram

452
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,640
 and find out a little bit more about the work they do.

453
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,200
 But even more importantly,

454
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
 to discover the central element

455
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,440
 to the start of the Exodus narrative.

456
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:52,080
 Akram. - Hi, Andrew.

457
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,400
 - Nice to meet you. - How are you?

458
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,520
 - I'm well, thank you. - Are you okay?

459
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,560
 - Yes, really good. - Have a seat, please.

460
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,600
 Thank you so much.

461
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,400
 It's such a pleasure to meet you today.

462
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,320
 - Thank you. - Yes.

463
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,680
 - Thank you, you're welcome.

464
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,600
 - Well, thanks so much for spending some time with us today.

465
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,600
 Why don't we start by you introducing yourself?

466
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,640
 Tell us a little bit about who you are,

467
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,280
 your family, what you do.

468
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,320
 - My name is Akram.

469
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,200
 And I have 45 years.

470
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,040
 - Mm-hmm.

471
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,000
 Since 2015, you've been working for an organization

472
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,600
 called Better for Kids International, I believe.

473
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,440
 - Yes.

474
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,840
 - Can you tell us a little bit about

475
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,560
 the work you're specifically doing

476
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,400
 with the orphans that you're working with?

477
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,840
 - Yes, since 2015, I worked with a mission.

478
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,120
 It's called Better for Kids.

479
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,480
 In here in Egypt, a mission, Egyptian mission.

480
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,360
 You can say that.

481
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,200
 And I'm here in Egypt.

482
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,040
 - For orphans.

483
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,160
 - For orphans, yes.

484
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,560
 It's called Good Samaritan.

485
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,120
 Good Samaritan Orphans.

486
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,120
 We have 40 kids, boy and girls,

487
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,040
 different age, since two years or one years,

488
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,920
 till married.

489
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,720
 - Tell us about where the children are from

490
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,360
 that you're working with, that you're serving.

491
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,800
 What sort of background do these children have?

492
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,640
 - Okay, we serve through the church,

493
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,960
 at the poor area.

494
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,120
 Not directly with the family, but through the church.

495
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,120
 So the church tell us about the poor family and the kids,

496
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,160
 and we go directly to the church

497
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,160
 and serve with the kids before the school.

498
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,240
 The age from three years or two years

499
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,840
 till six or seven years.

500
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,280
 - Right, right.

501
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,240
 - We make an education curriculum.

502
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,080
 - Yes.

503
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,480
 - A, B, C, D, and alphabet, or something like that.

504
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,320
 - Yeah.

505
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,720
 - And curriculum for the Bible study.

506
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,600
 I love the kids.

507
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,160
 All of my life I serve the adults.

508
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,680
 I sing with the adults.

509
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,840
 I give the training with the adults.

510
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,920
 But my heart with the kids.

511
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,040
 The wonderful time and the best time

512
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,040
 I spend during the week with my Sunday school,

513
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,760
 with seven or 10 kids in my class.

514
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,800
 - And so it's the kids and it's their situation,

515
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,760
 it's their, the background,

516
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,920
 and maybe the poverty they've experienced

517
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,680
 that does something in your heart.

518
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,320
 - Yes.

519
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,240
 The need.

520
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,080
 - The need they have.

521
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,920
 - Yes.

522
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,120
 I search all the time what the kids need.

523
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,200
 So I can see the kids for this situation,

524
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,400
 for this background, for our family,

525
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,640
 for the area that's very poor.

526
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,760
 He can find anything easily.

527
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,720
 So my heart, the kids' needs,

528
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,520
 need the first for the love.

529
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
 Love without anything.

530
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,720
 I love you, just I love you.

531
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,880
 Without anything.

532
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:10,760
 And really, my heart can reach for the kids directly.

533
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:16,040
 So I like to work with the kids

534
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,640
 'cause if the kids don't care for you, it's okay.

535
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,480
 - Yeah.

536
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,480
 - But if you found really love for your heart,

537
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,320
 he come for you.

538
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,720
 If you punish him or if you make anything,

539
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
 but still he love you.

540
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,800
 - Yeah, yeah.

541
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,440
 - Because you love the first

542
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,920
 and you have a really love for the kids.

543
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,440
 - So your love really motivates

544
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,920
 your desire to help them as well.

545
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,280
 - Yes, yes.

546
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,880
 - When you can't help a kid,

547
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,840
 how does that feel for you personally?

548
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,320
 Is it frustrating?

549
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,440
 Are you upset?

550
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,080
 How do you handle the emotions when you can't help a kid?

551
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,080
 - Many time I cry with the kids.

552
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,280
 (laughs)

553
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,080
 When I pray with them, yes.

554
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,920
 When I speak with the kids

555
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,240
 and he explain what's actually happened with him.

556
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,080
 - Yeah.

557
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,520
 - Because many time I found kids,

558
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,800
 his dad or mom punish him in the hand.

559
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,560
 - Hurt him?

560
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,400
 - Something like that, yes.

561
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,240
 Something like that.

562
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,080
 - Abuse.

563
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,640
 - Abuse, yes.

564
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,760
 I'm poor, I found some kids,

565
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,520
 her mom because he do something wrong,

566
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,760
 he bring the spoon and put it in the fire.

567
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,920
 - Wow.

568
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,720
 - And put for the hands.

569
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,040
 At this time I didn't make my eyes

570
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
 to cry with the kids

571
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,000
 'cause it's a very difficult situation.

572
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,920
 - And that's your heart for them.

573
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,000
 That's your compassion coming out of you.

574
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,840
 - Yes.

575
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,680
 - Emotionally.

576
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,120
 - Yes, yes, yes, really.

577
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,040
 - And that feeling in you,

578
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,120
 I'm assuming that that's what drives your response.

579
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,280
 You act because your heart is broken.

580
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,040
 - Yes, many time I pray for how can I help these kids?

581
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,040
 I want to bring this boy or girl with me at my home.

582
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,240
 If I can't do that, okay, directly I will do that.

583
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,960
 What's in here, we can do that.

584
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,240
 Just pray for them.

585
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,560
 - Pray for them, yeah.

586
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,920
 You've mentioned a few times

587
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,120
 that one of the reasons why you do what you do

588
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,080
 is 'cause of your relationship with God.

589
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,920
 - First.

590
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,760
 - Yeah.

591
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,600
 What is it about God that motivates you

592
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,840
 to serve these children?

593
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,360
 - Heart of Jesus for the kids.

594
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,080
 You know the situation with Jesus

595
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,080
 when the children come to Jesus and serve Jesus,

596
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't pray Jesus.

597
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,440
 The different situation between heart Jesus for the kids

598
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,000
 and heart disciples for the kids.

599
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,560
 Jesus look for the kids, it's a human,

600
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,520
 not just the kids.

601
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,040
 He's big.

602
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,040
 So each time I read this chapter for the Bible

603
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,080
 about the heart of Jesus through the kids,

604
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,560
 I thank God for, I pray each time,

605
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,560
 give me little part for your heart to serve the kids.

606
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,120
 - I think what we see in that story

607
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,640
 is Jesus' compassion for those kids.

608
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,800
 And so you pray for just a little bit

609
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,760
 of that compassion yourself for the kids.

610
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,480
 - Yes, really, really.

611
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,280
 - And that compassion has really defined

612
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,320
 your whole ministry, your whole life.

613
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,480
 - Really, I do that.

614
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,480
 The Bible used the expression as Jesus is very big, angry.

615
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,560
 Two time, it's the same expression.

616
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,480
 The Bible, the New Testament use it for the Jesus.

617
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,640
 The first time, the first time,

618
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,000
 this is the second time with the kids.

619
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 The first time when the Jesus come to the temple.

620
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,160
 - Temple, yes.

621
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,320
 - Yeah, and he say that many people

622
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,960
 pray and say something, yeah.

623
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
 The same expression, Jesus is very angry.

624
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,480
 I can't remember what the expression in English actually,

625
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,920
 but in Arabic, the same words,

626
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,160
 the same letters for the words for the Jesus

627
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,760
 for all of the New Testament.

628
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,040
 - Wow.

629
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,120
 So the anger Jesus has in the temple,

630
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,920
 in John chapter two, I think.

631
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,760
 - Yes, yes.

632
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,560
 - It's the same anger he has against the disciples

633
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,080
 for stopping them coming to the kids.

634
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,160
 I never knew that in Arabic.

635
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,280
 That's beautiful.

636
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,680
 - The same words, the same letters, and wow.

637
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,000
 - Wow.

638
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,680
 - He be angry for the 12 men,

639
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,440
 is very nearest for the Jesus.

640
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,520
 - Yeah.

641
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,560
 - And at the same, equal from,

642
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,400
 he say that the men pray something at the temple.

643
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
 - Yeah, wow.

644
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,240
 Wow.

645
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,560
 So that drives what you do.

646
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,400
 - Yes.

647
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,600
 - That same kind of,

648
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,240
 like, 'cause I think what you're talking about

649
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,600
 is compassion comes with two elements to it.

650
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,000
 It comes with the love.

651
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,520
 There's this love that drives compassion.

652
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,040
 But also, like in that example you just shared

653
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,320
 on the Bible story, it comes with a certain sense of anger,

654
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,920
 like a righteous anger.

655
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,720
 And both the love and the anger can actually form

656
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,880
 the compassion that we have to act in the way that we do.

657
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,520
 Well, thank you so much for spending so much time with us

658
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,400
 and telling us about the work you do,

659
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,520
 but also more importantly, perhaps, the heart you have

660
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,120
 to serve the vulnerable children that you're working with.

661
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,960
 All the best.

662
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,040
 - Thank you.

663
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,880
 Thank you.

664
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
 - I think it's really quite profound

665
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,920
 what Akram opened up for me,

666
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,120
 looking at the Arabic words there for that anger.

667
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,560
 And it really is so true that God's compassion

668
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,560
 has this dual element to it, love and justice,

669
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,200
 mercy and the righting of wrongs.

670
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,360
 And those two things come together to create

671
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,160
 the holistic way that God is compassionate.

672
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,440
 And it's that that we see now

673
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,360
 as we open up this part of the story.

674
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,240
 I wanna show you just very briefly here

675
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,920
 some of the ways in which we see this compassion at work.

676
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,160
 It says here from verse 24,

677
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,640
 "God heard their groaning,

678
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,960
 "and he remembered his covenant with Abraham,

679
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,360
 "Isaac and with Jacob.

680
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,440
 "So God looked on the Israelites

681
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,120
 "and was concerned about them."

682
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,440
 This is just, interestingly,

683
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,880
 this is just 15 words in Hebrew, those two verses.

684
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,040
 They're just 15 words in Hebrew.

685
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,120
 Four of those words is the word God, Elohim.

686
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,120
 God would later show himself as the I am that I am Yahweh,

687
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,560
 who we've become to be known.

688
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,240
 In this moment, though, he's just Elohim, God.

689
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,760
 And God, I'm gonna draw on this.

690
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,480
 Can everybody see this?

691
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,800
 Everybody okay?

692
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,360
 So I'm gonna draw God.

693
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,520
 There you go.

694
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,480
 You're welcome.

695
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,040
 It says here four times God something,

696
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,520
 God something, God something, God something.

697
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,440
 So first of all, it's God hears.

698
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,280
 Then it says God remembers.

699
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,640
 Then it says God sees.

700
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,040
 And finally, it says God knows.

701
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,320
 This is what the Hebrew basically tells us

702
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,200
 to help us to understand the heart of God for his people.

703
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,760
 He is a God who hears, a God who remembers,

704
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,200
 a God who sees, and a God who knows.

705
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,240
 It says, first of all, that he hears their groaning.

706
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,960
 Now, this is really important.

707
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,520
 The word in Hebrew here means basically

708
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,320
 not just to listen, not just to hear something,

709
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,200
 but to actually act on what is being heard.

710
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,680
 In other words, in the Hebrew,

711
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,040
 to understand how God hears,

712
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,120
 it's not just to think that God has kind of like

713
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,880
 heard my prayer, but it's actually that God

714
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,080
 is gonna respond and act on what he's heard.

715
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,920
 Give you an example.

716
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,680
 It's like my daughter Mia.

717
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,360
 Now, I say to my daughter Mia every morning,

718
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,040
 make your bed.

719
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,360
 Pretty much every day I come home after work

720
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,640
 and the bed is not made.

721
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,800
 And I know that she heard me, but she didn't hear me.

722
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,120
 Are you with me?

723
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,600
 Did you get that, right?

724
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,440
 'Cause if she had really heard me,

725
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,240
 she would have made the bed, right?

726
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,600
 Okay, that's the same sort of thing here.

727
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,920
 God is hearing in the sense that

728
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,560
 he doesn't just receive some sound,

729
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,040
 but he's actually going to respond.

730
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,800
 He's actually going to act.

731
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,840
 And it's interesting.

732
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,180
 Here's what he's heard.

733
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,760
 Not the crying, shouting, loud stuff,

734
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,400
 as important as that was.

735
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,660
 He hears their groaning.

736
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,120
 In other words, what he hears is their personal,

737
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,000
 oh man, this is hard.

738
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,200
 You need to know here that that's your God.

739
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,280
 That sure, he comes and fights for the injustices

740
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,120
 of this world.

741
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,920
 Sure, he comes and does great, amazing things.

742
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,680
 He parts seas, he's a fire on top of a mountain.

743
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,520
 He's all those things.

744
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,040
 But you need to know first and foremost,

745
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,680
 he's a personal, intimate God for you.

746
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,200
 He hears your groans, those private, personal things

747
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,120
 that no one else hears or even knows.

748
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,080
 Those internal, oh man, if only I could be free.

749
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,920
 Those are the things that he hears.

750
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,420
 And then it says that he remembers.

751
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,920
 Now this word for remember is zakar in the Hebrew.

752
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,120
 It doesn't mean that God has forgotten.

753
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,520
 I know when we hear this in the English,

754
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
 it's very easy for us to think

755
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,320
 that remembering means forgetting.

756
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,880
 It's not saying that God has forgotten his people

757
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,480
 and that in their crying out, he's gone like,

758
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,200
 oh yeah, they're in slavery.

759
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,880
 Totally forgot.

760
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,200
 It's not meaning that.

761
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,240
 What it actually means is that when God remembers,

762
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,800
 the Hebrew word basically means to commit to a promise,

763
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,280
 to commit to something that you have promised to do.

764
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,740
 So where hearing comes with an action,

765
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,400
 the action is this remembering of the covenant,

766
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,000
 the covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

767
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,980
 God remembers means that he is going to stay committed

768
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,120
 to the promise that he's made.

769
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,520
 Give an example in Chris and I's life.

770
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,080
 We got married 25 years ago.

771
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,520
 And when we got married, I said some vows.

772
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,760
 We said some vows to each other.

773
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
 And part of our vows to each other was

774
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,720
 we would not sleep with anybody else.

775
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,880
 We would not have an affair.

776
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,240
 We would stay committed to each other.

777
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,840
 And that's the way things are gonna be.

778
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,320
 We made those vows to one another.

779
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,280
 We made those vows to God.

780
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:36,040
 I, after 25 years, have remembered those vows,

781
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,160
 not because I forget them here and there,

782
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,240
 but because I've remained faithful to her for 25 years.

783
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,060
 Do you see that?

784
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,160
 That's remembering the vows.

785
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,760
 That's me standing and saying,

786
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,320
 I made a commitment to this woman

787
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,920
 and I'm gonna stand by with her and alongside of her.

788
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,760
 And she's done the same for me, I think.

789
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,600
 Yes, you have.

790
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,420
 Good.

791
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,260
 She's done the same.

792
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,760
 (audience laughing)

793
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,000
 For me.

794
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,720
 So she has remembered the covenant.

795
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,160
 I've remembered the covenant we've made.

796
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,880
 And by remembering, what that means is,

797
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,000
 not that we've forgotten, it's that we're living it out.

798
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,640
 We're committing to that priority.

799
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,880
 We're committing to that promise.

800
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,160
 When God says he remembers his covenant with Israel,

801
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,640
 he's saying, I haven't given up.

802
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,120
 I haven't stepped away from that.

803
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,560
 I'm still committed to that promise.

804
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,320
 Genesis 12 is the heart of that promise

805
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,960
 where God shows up to Abraham and he says,

806
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,840
 I'm gonna take you and I'm gonna bless you.

807
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,000
 I'm gonna make your name great.

808
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,100
 I'm gonna make the nation great.

809
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,480
 And all nations are gonna be blessed through you.

810
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,800
 God comes in the Exodus and says,

811
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,680
 I haven't given up on that.

812
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,120
 I am still that person.

813
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,200
 I'm still that God.

814
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,260
 That's still my promise.

815
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,040
 And I'm working that promise through even to this day.

816
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,080
 So when you think I'm distant, I'm not.

817
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,360
 When you think I haven't answered, I'm still at work.

818
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,720
 I'm a God who remembers.

819
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,240
 I'm committed to you.

820
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,640
 And I will prove my faithfulness and my commitment to you.

821
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,440
 And he does this by seeing them.

822
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,880
 He then looks upon them.

823
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,400
 That word is the word that we've looked at

824
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,280
 over the last couple of weeks.

825
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,600
 It's the word Rahah.

826
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,000
 It's the same word that Pharaoh's daughter,

827
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,200
 when she saw Moses in the reeds, she Rahad him.

828
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,320
 It means to see with emotion.

829
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
 It's this idea of compassion.

830
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,640
 It's this idea of something changing inside of our hearts

831
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,760
 and that change causing us to wanna be different,

832
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,200
 causing us to act in a different way.

833
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,480
 This is the same thing that Moses had

834
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,240
 when he saw his own people under slavery and he Rahad.

835
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,280
 He saw them with emotion, this compassion.

836
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,320
 This is what Akram was talking about in the film.

837
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,000
 And it's so important that you see before God does anything

838
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,720
 that he hears, he remembers, and then he has this compassion.

839
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,400
 He sees the people for who they truly are

840
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,760
 and he sees them with this idea of justice and love,

841
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,560
 this idea of mercy and righting wrong.

842
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,720
 And because he sees them, he's going to go

843
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,040
 and do all the things that he does in the Exodus.

844
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,040
 And so often, God will refer back to this

845
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,880
 in the chapters ahead.

846
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,560
 I see you, I see you, I see you.

847
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,120
 And what's key to grab ahold of here

848
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,120
 is something that I think is very important

849
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,400
 'cause we forget this a lot.

850
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,640
 You see, God does not act against the evil

851
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,320
 or the sin of Egypt.

852
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,160
 He primarily acts on behalf of the freedom of his people.

853
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,440
 Now, it's really important you get this.

854
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,440
 See, compassion, not judgment, is the fuel to Exodus.

855
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,440
 Now, did the sin need to be judged?

856
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,160
 Does our sin need to be judged

857
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
 and dealt with with the Lord?

858
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,120
 Of course it does, but you need to understand

859
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,760
 that the starting point is not an angry God

860
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,840
 who has wrath in his heart against his sinful people

861
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,320
 and he wants to judge them.

862
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,880
 The starting part is he looks upon us, he sees us,

863
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,040
 he has compassion with us, he has grace and he has mercy

864
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,880
 and he has love.

865
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,760
 And just like Akram sees those kids

866
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,700
 and he sees all the things happening in their lives,

867
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,840
 but he's first motivated by love,

868
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,320
 a love that he's found in God.

869
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,400
 So God sees, which means compassion

870
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,860
 is always the driving force of why God comes

871
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,880
 and judges sin.

872
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,560
 It's because he wants to see us free.

873
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
 It's because he loves us.

874
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,420
 And there is mercy and justice.

875
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,320
 There is love and the righting of wrongs.

876
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,840
 And those two things come together.

877
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,440
 And the heart of it is all this idea of love, compassion.

878
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,840
 Some of you, some of us, 'cause I do this too,

879
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,280
 some of us, we stay in our sin

880
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,640
 because we're afraid of the anger of God against us.

881
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,440
 And we don't deal with it and we kind of live in it

882
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,000
 and we think God's angry at us, God's upset at us,

883
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,760
 God must be so angry at me.

884
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,000
 Oh man, he knows all the brokenness in my life

885
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,700
 and he can't like me.

886
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,800
 God's not gonna do anything for me.

887
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,760
 Now the danger of that is it becomes a cycle

888
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,560
 'cause then we think we have to try to earn God's love.

889
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,240
 We have to try to make him happy with us,

890
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,720
 try to appease him.

891
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,080
 All of that goes out the window when we realize

892
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,120
 that it is compassion that turns the heart of God to us.

893
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,960
 Not his anger, not his wrath, not all of that.

894
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,200
 It's his compassion.

895
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,320
 He looks on us with love and in his love,

896
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,440
 we are able to love 'cause he first loved us.

897
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,000
 He sees you.

898
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,340
 And that should set some of you free here

899
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,560
 to actually deal with some of the sin

900
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,040
 that you need to be dealing with.

901
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,560
 Knowing that God is not some wrathful, angry guy

902
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,840
 who wants to smite you.

903
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,960
 He's a father who runs in the field towards you,

904
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,320
 puts a robe on you and a ring on your finger

905
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,000
 and sandals on your feet and he says,

906
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,680
 "You're not gonna be one of my slaves,

907
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,840
 "you're my son, my daughter, my child

908
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,360
 "and we're gonna do this together."

909
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,600
 So he sees and then finally it says that he knows.

910
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,720
 I love this.

911
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,040
 He knows.

912
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,360
 The Hebrew word literally means

913
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,000
 that he understands everything about everything.

914
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,800
 It's this biblical sense of intimacy

915
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,400
 and knowing something fully and completely.

916
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,880
 And I want you to get this.

917
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,200
 God knows everything about you

918
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,160
 and he has not turned his back on you.

919
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,040
 God knows all of your sin and brokenness

920
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,780
 and it does not offend him.

921
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,080
 Sin hurts him, sin upsets him,

922
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,680
 sin he needs to deal with absolutely.

923
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,120
 But he knows the intimate details of your life

924
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,120
 that no one else knows.

925
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,840
 The stuff that you would never have the courage

926
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,640
 to share with anybody, he knows that

927
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,460
 and he still loves you.

928
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,680
 So this security comes in knowing a God

929
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,800
 who knows us completely and still accepts us

930
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,640
 and embraces us.

931
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,340
 He hears us, he remembers his covenant,

932
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,740
 he sees with compassion, he leads with compassion

933
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,460
 and he knows us completely.

934
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,460
 And because of all of that, that is the God of Exodus.

935
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,180
 That's the God who reveals himself to his people.

936
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,300
 That's the God who says, "Before I do anything,

937
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,900
 "you need to know who I am."

938
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,660
 And if I was to kind of summarize it

939
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,500
 in ways in which you can easily remember, here it is.

940
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,380
 He is basically declaring that he is close.

941
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,460
 He hears.

942
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,720
 He's not distant, he hasn't given up on you.

943
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,120
 He's close to you.

944
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,720
 What he's also saying is that he's committed to you.

945
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,700
 He's committed to you.

946
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,420
 He's walking with you.

947
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,840
 He's right here, right now, fighting battles for you.

948
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,520
 He has not given up on you.

949
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,060
 He remembers his covenant.

950
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,680
 He's committed.

951
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,160
 He's compassionate over everything

952
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,280
 that's happening in your life,

953
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,720
 all the stuff that's going on,

954
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,120
 all the things that you thought he would be angry about

955
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,360
 or upset about, he loves you

956
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,100
 and in his love, he has mercy and justice.

957
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,500
 He wants to be with you.

958
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,860
 He is compassionate.

959
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,500
 And then finally, of course, he is concerned

960
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,800
 because he knows you and he's concerned

961
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,580
 about the brokenness and the sin

962
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,220
 and what that does to you

963
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,460
 and his concern drives him to want to respond.

964
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,620
 He is close, he is committed, he is compassionate,

965
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,720
 he is concerned.

966
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,260
 That's the God of Exodus.

967
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:56,700
 And that needs to be our framework that we have

968
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,340
 as we step towards the burning bush next week.

969
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,140
 This is how God introduces himself

970
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:06,680
 to all of his people in their slavery to sin.

971
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,900
 And this, my friends, if you remember this,

972
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,820
 if this becomes how you see God,

973
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,920
 you will actually have the courage to cry out

974
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,360
 and see the coming of a promise in your life.

975
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,780
 May that fill you with joy as you take the serious steps

976
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,300
 to no longer ignore the realities

977
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,060
 of what is happening in your life

978
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:34,180
 and stand before a God who hears, remembers, sees, and knows

979
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,740
 and allow him to set you free.

980
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,680
 Can I pray for you?

981
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,740
 When you're with me, stand with me and I'm gonna pray.

982
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:48,180
 Father, we are standing before you today as your people

983
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,420
 in the same way that Israel stood before you

984
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,260
 and groaned and cried out.

985
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,460
 And Lord, for those of us in this room

986
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,100
 who have silenced our voice,

987
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:06,460
 so those of us in this room who have silenced

988
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,580
 our cry of our soul for freedom,

989
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,480
 Father, I pray that you would come by your spirit

990
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,340
 in this moment and just begin to rebirth and refresh

991
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,420
 and renew that desire within us.

992
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,320
 Lord, you hear our groaning,

993
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,300
 those private, intimate,

994
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:30,220
 where we are expressing the depth of our pain,

995
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,360
 brokenness, you hear and you know.

996
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,780
 God, you have not given up on us.

997
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,540
 Every person here, you remember your covenant

998
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,140
 that you have with them, the new covenant

999
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,040
 that is in the blood of Christ Jesus,

1000
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,080
 saved, redeemed, sanctified, being made new in him,

1001
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,960
 a new creation as Paul would talk about it.

1002
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,580
 God looks at you and he remembers the blood

1003
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,060
 that was shed on the cross of Calvary

1004
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,180
 and he sees you through that blood.

1005
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,820
 He sees you and he loves you.

1006
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,860
 God knows everything about you

1007
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,060
 and because he knows everything about you,

1008
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,100
 there is nothing you need to hide from him.

1009
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,520
 The enemy will want you to feel shame,

1010
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,180
 but Adam and Eve were naked and unashamed.

1011
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,160
 And I pray that as you find your cry again,

1012
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,640
 I pray that as you recognize God is hearing you,

1013
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,400
 remembers you and sees you,

1014
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,440
 I pray you will find yourself unashamed before him.

1015
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,580
 You will find yourself with a cry in your heart

1016
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,200
 that says, do whatever it takes, Lord.

1017
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,620
 That you would come and realize

1018
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,220
 that those promises do stand,

1019
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,740
 that he is faithful and he is at work.

1020
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
 And I pray that this would be a God.

1021
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,320
 This would be your God.

1022
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,120
 This would be the one that you would worship.

1023
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,360
 Now, whenever the enemy would come

1024
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,420
 to try to tell you differently,

1025
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,700
 God is like this, no, God is not like that,

1026
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,780
 just like he did to Adam and Eve in the garden,

1027
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,620
 you would say, no, no, I stand on what the scriptures say.

1028
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:12,500
 I stand on a God who hears, remembers, sees and knows.

1029
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,500
 That's my God.

1030
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,200
 Father, I pray that that would set us free.

1031
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,200
 And we thank you for this, in Jesus' name.

1032
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,040
 Amen.

1033
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,400
