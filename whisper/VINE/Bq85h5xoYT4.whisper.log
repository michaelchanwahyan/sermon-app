[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   It begins in the emptiness of nothingness, where darkness has extinguished even the memory
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.240]   of light, where nothingness and emptiness tear space into fragments and everything is
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.800]   nothing at all.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.600]   It starts here, where fear shackles and failure persists, where slavery binds and oppression
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:35.560]   persists, it starts here, in the place you least expect, suddenly, a light.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.480]   Dancing to be noticed, within the empire of darkness, crackling with beginnings, restless
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.940]   with life, as if the emptiness had simply been waiting for divine direction.
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.400]   It starts here.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.480]   Shadows now play against the walls of death, movement and memory and miracles and might,
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.480]   breaking into nothingness with the heresy of possibility, shaming the darkness with
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.600]   the creation of hope.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.600]   It starts here.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.480]   A drawing out, a calling forth, a voice in the wilderness, a wilderness of voices, whispers
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.840]   of freedom, bushes on fire, a journey beyond, ascending to glory.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.880]   It starts here, in the emptiness of nothingness, in the slavery and oppression, in the fear
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.680]   and the failure and the pharaohs in us all.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.400]   May you see what heaven is stirring.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.480]   For a light has come and a light is coming, death now dead, bushes now burning, yes a
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.400]   light has come and a light is coming, death now dead, bushes now burning.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   [Music]
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.900]   (music fades)
