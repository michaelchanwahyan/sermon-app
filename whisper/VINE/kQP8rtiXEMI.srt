1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
 Well, thank you very much.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,920
 Well, what a joy and honor to share with the congregation

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,280
 here in Yuen Long.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,280
 Well, you may wonder why at this time of the year

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,240
 we talk about closures and new beginnings.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,280
 Of course, we know that closures and new beginnings

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,360
 does not always follow through the calendar year.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,400
 So say, for instance, in the medical line,

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,660
 all the medical students here in Hong Kong would graduate in June,

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,480
 and they would start in July.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,040
 And that was what happened for me 38 years ago.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,520
 But the most important and the significance

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,560
 of the new beginnings is, as I started to work,

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,520
 I got to meet my wife.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,680
 Yeah, so-- and of course, she decides

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,880
 what I get dressed for today.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,880
 Well, so a few years down the road,

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,280
 as I worked in the medical line, I

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,020
 got a chance to go overseas in St. Louis, Midwest of US,

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,940
 to do my overseas training.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,940
 So at the time, I was following a mentor who really ventures

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,420
 into the advance of new technologies

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,060
 in the medical line.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,400
 So he actually designed a lot of new surgical procedures.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,300
 Of course, as all attempts-- and there were, in fact,

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,700
 a lot of attempts that failed.

27
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,180
 And he actually faces a lot of hurdles and radicals

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,260
 along the way.

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,640
 There was one day, his bigger boss

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,500
 came into the operating room and changed the clock on the wall

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,740
 to a calendar, just to signify that, well,

32
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,960
 the operation, which was supposed to take a few hours,

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,620
 now take more than a few days.

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,220
 So it was really bad that you received such a reminder

35
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,540
 by your big boss.

36
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,100
 But against all these hurdles, he actually

37
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,900
 made it through and introduced what

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,860
 we now call minimally invasive surgery, or keyhole surgery,

39
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,540
 in short.

40
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,740
 So I remember his very famous quote.

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,980
 Well, he said, "Not all new things are good,

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,180
 but all good things must be new at some time."

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,980
 So very true.

44
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,540
 So as he journeyed through uncharted water in his times,

45
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,740
 he championed a new cause, which really

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,700
 changed the surgical practice throughout the world.

47
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,820
 I'm very glad to be involved in this new beginning

48
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,740
 and be part of it.

49
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,140
 So new beginning carries significant impact,

50
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,960
 even as I ponder on this very work.

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,100
 Now, new beginning, or beginning in New Testament,

52
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,740
 carries very significant and rich meanings.

53
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,500
 It can mean that there are things that we start--

54
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,460
 it can talk about the origin, the beginning of events,

55
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,740
 or early days.

56
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,060
 So I would actually expand on some of the New Testament

57
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,900
 references to beginnings as today's sharing.

58
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,780
 Closure and new beginnings.

59
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,420
 We'll look at this through the Gospel of Mark,

60
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,740
 as well as the Gospel of John.

61
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,980
 So we remember John 1.1.

62
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,700
 "In the beginning was the Word.

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:31,020
 The Word was with God, and the Word was God.

64
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,100
 And he was with God in the beginning."

65
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,780
 So it's actually a very powerful new understanding

66
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,020
 of the whole idea of beginning and Word.

67
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,420
 So we know Word actually comes from the original Greek logos.

68
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,940
 So it was a very new and groundbreaking new

69
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,820
 interpretation, because logos was understood

70
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,460
 by Greek as just knowledge.

71
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,420
 But John was able to integrate that knowledge

72
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,300
 with the divine wisdom of God, which was referred

73
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,260
 to in the Old Testament.

74
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,740
 And then he also connected this very Word

75
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,220
 as Jesus Christ, the Word of God.

76
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,180
 So it was groundbreaking.

77
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,620
 Now, it's also important that this very reference

78
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,260
 of "in the beginning" was a resonance of the very first

79
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,740
 verse in the whole Bible.

80
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,620
 Genesis 1.1.

81
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,620
 Verse 1.

82
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,160
 "In the beginning God created heavens and earth."

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,940
 So we have to understand the whole perspective

84
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,820
 of new beginnings in the whole Bible

85
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,940
 was that God saw that it was good.

86
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,580
 And in fact, when he created the human beings,

87
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,660
 he said it was very good.

88
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,820
 So to anchor our understanding on beginnings,

89
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,460
 all beginnings, as blessed by God, are good in his eyes.

90
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,360
 So as we expand on beginning and end,

91
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,960
 I just want to highlight two things

92
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,320
 about our understanding of beginning

93
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,080
 that I will elaborate along the way.

94
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,560
 Number one, every beginning is the end of a prior beginning.

95
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,040
 Well, a little bit complicated.

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,800
 Every new beginning means the closure of a prior beginning.

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,680
 And number two, every beginning should

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
 be aiming towards a predetermined end.

99
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,900
 Well, you can actually draw from Hebrews

100
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,460
 that talk about Jesus being the pioneer

101
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,340
 and the perfecter of our faith.

102
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,520
 So here it reads from Hebrews, "Let us throw off

103
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,640
 everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles,

104
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,780
 and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,

105
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,760
 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer

106
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,040
 and the perfecter of faith."

107
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,460
 Beginning and end.

108
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,840
 Jesus indeed sees us through from the very beginning

109
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,640
 to the very end.

110
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,200
 Now paradoxically, sometimes new beginnings

111
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,220
 start with closure of the past.

112
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,760
 Let's look at the Gospel of Mark to look

113
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,040
 at this interesting interaction between endings and beginning.

114
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,080
 So Mark chapter 1, the beginning of the good news

115
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,160
 about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God,

116
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,360
 as Jesus walked alongside the Lake of Galilee,

117
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,160
 he saw Simon and his brother Andrew

118
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,400
 casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.

119
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,040
 And Jesus said, "Come, follow me,

120
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,940
 and I will send you out to fish for people."

121
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,320
 And at once they left their nest and followed him.

122
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,720
 So this is a call for a new beginning for Peter.

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,440
 And actually, begins with the closure of a prior chapter

124
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,320
 for Peter and the first disciples.

125
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,200
 Now this call, this first act of Jesus' ministry,

126
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,760
 is not obviously, is not a spectacular miracle

127
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,320
 or great sermon.

128
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,000
 It's a simple call for a few ordinary people to follow him.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
 A call to follow him.

130
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,640
 Now the Sea of Galilee is actually

131
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,200
 a very beautiful lake.

132
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,360
 In the first century, we have to understand

133
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,440
 that actually the staple of food for most of the people

134
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,120
 is actually fish rather than meat.

135
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,240
 And the fishing industry in the Sea of Galilee

136
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,440
 is actually, was actually very prosperous to the extent

137
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,560
 that the catch was not only consumed by the local market,

138
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,480
 but it was exported as far as Alexandria in Egypt,

139
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,120
 or even Antioch in Syria.

140
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,280
 So it's an international marketplace.

141
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,160
 The fishermen of Galilee, they would

142
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,760
 compete in the large Mediterranean market,

143
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,520
 demonstrating the skill and probably

144
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,480
 the mastery of the Greek, an international language

145
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,880
 of commerce at the time.

146
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,160
 So the fishermen Jesus called are not necessarily

147
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,440
 just daytime disposable or dispensable day laborers.

148
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,760
 And to survive in this market, they

149
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,200
 need to be savvy and are probably

150
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,200
 successful small business people.

151
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,080
 Are these backgrounds of the first generation disciples

152
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,240
 somewhat like many of us here in this congregation?

153
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,440
 We work hard in the community, in the society,

154
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,920
 with our skills in respective professions.

155
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,640
 Others are working in a booming or challenging business.

156
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,160
 Some of us are bilingual, and many of us

157
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,120
 are engaged in international trade.

158
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,120
 Is Jesus also calling some of us or most of us

159
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,160
 who happen to be in this city, in Yunnan,

160
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,360
 by his divine purpose?

161
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,080
 But to start with, there needs to be some closure

162
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,840
 to prior chapters.

163
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,200
 Bonhoeffer talked about this calling of disciples.

164
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,480
 So he talks about, well, when Christ calls a man,

165
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,040
 he bids him come and die.

166
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,880
 Wow, what a serious matter.

167
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,520
 Following Jesus is indeed costly and a serious matter.

168
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,720
 A beginning of following Jesus, start

169
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,960
 with letting go of the past, is a type of death

170
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,400
 and then picking up of the cross.

171
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,800
 Well, actually, myself, I had a very similar challenge

172
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,640
 some almost 40 years ago, which I

173
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,760
 refer to, with a very similar choice

174
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,680
 from that of the disciples.

175
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,840
 So at that time, I was about to enter into medical school.

176
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,800
 And that particular summer, somehow, the theme of the church

177
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,520
 was surrendering ourselves to serve.

178
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,860
 So I hesitated to embrace the call.

179
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,920
 I would not like to end my chapter too early.

180
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,680
 Well, in fact, I haven't even started my career.

181
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,800
 So I wrestled, but I made a very subtle decision.

182
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,480
 Well, maybe this call to surrender is not for me.

183
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,960
 If anything, that should be responded

184
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,920
 to some years down the road.

185
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,240
 Well, very sadly, that deferral to some years down the road

186
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,920
 turned out to become decades.

187
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,800
 I wondered what my path could be if I

188
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,760
 had made a very different response at that time.

189
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,840
 Well, one never really knows.

190
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,560
 But as I've just shared, a chapter closed

191
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,600
 is a chapter closed, be it a bad or a good choice.

192
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,400
 Well, fast forward, I've been attending this Vine Church

193
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,600
 for the past 16 years.

194
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,480
 And I've been serving as an elder in the Vine Church

195
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,240
 for the past nine years.

196
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,240
 I still remember on the hot summer day--

197
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,080
 I guess it's also like June, July--

198
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,800
 without air conditioning, that's how

199
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,280
 we attended the very first worship service in Wan Chai

200
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,920
 as we were completing the renovation at the time.

201
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,160
 Well, the auditorium was like a hot furnace.

202
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,640
 But then the enthusiasm drove us to complete the renovation.

203
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,640
 I still remember the days when we were really, really

204
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,080
 short of funds.

205
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,480
 Well, you want to take a picture?

206
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,980
 OK, sure.

207
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,560
 So at the time, we were really short of funds.

208
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,280
 And we didn't even have enough cash

209
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,600
 to pay our employees monthly salaries.

210
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,280
 So what did we do?

211
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,440
 We knelt down, we confessed our sins,

212
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,200
 and we prayed for the Lord's favor.

213
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,040
 It was through the faithfulness of the congregation

214
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,840
 that some time down the road, we were

215
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,320
 able to pay off all the debts and remained financially stable

216
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,360
 ever since.

217
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,960
 Then we all went through the challenge

218
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,040
 of the social movements and the COVID restrictions.

219
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,160
 After COVID, the attendance in Wan Chai

220
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,560
 averages around 1,005 compared with the original 2,004.

221
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,000
 So we were slowly coming back to pace.

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,160
 But then yet, it was in that kind of difficulty

223
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,800
 that our very, very first church plant is here,

224
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,640
 birthed in Yuen Long.

225
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,440
 Praise God.

226
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,360
 [APPLAUSE]

227
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,440
 But on a personal level, serving as an elder and chairman

228
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,960
 through this season has been a life-changing experience

229
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,360
 for me.

230
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,680
 And I want to say on behalf of the past eldership,

231
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,480
 including those who have stepped down, including myself,

232
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,400
 after years of service, and those who are still

233
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,160
 serving in the current board, and then, of course,

234
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,880
 there are others in our midst who continue to serve

235
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,960
 this very congregation.

236
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,440
 I want to thank you, because you're also

237
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,240
 part of the community that gives faithfully.

238
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,280
 And we have that opportunity and privilege

239
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,080
 to serve you in areas of spiritual directions,

240
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,240
 organizational governance, financial prudence,

241
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,360
 and corporate leadership.

242
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
 I want to thank you because many of you

243
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,200
 have toughed it out in difficult seasons.

244
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,600
 So I'm not sure whether many of you

245
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,360
 have attended the EIS earlier days.

246
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,240
 And well, Ivan and Ta and Tim will

247
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,680
 recall that one odd day, the air conditioning broke down

248
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,040
 altogether.

249
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,360
 And then you have to open up the tents.

250
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,440
 And then you just continue to meet

251
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,560
 in the tented as a congregation.

252
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,480
 But I think that is where we were refined.

253
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,920
 And we continue to be refined as a congregation.

254
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,040
 So well done.

255
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,600
 And keep it up with the air conditioning well functioning.

256
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:39,440
 Well, I'm so glad that every time I come,

257
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
 well, this becomes more and more packed.

258
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,440
 And I'm looking forward to your opening up

259
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,280
 your third or fourth service, whatever that means.

260
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,600
 But I understand that you have already started the youth

261
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,100
 service.

262
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,160
 Yes, wonderful.

263
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,240
 You are reaching out to a generation,

264
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,920
 to the next generation, to bring hope for the youth

265
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,040
 and for the community as a whole.

266
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,400
 As for myself, on a personal note,

267
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,000
 having to step down after nine years of service

268
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,240
 is actually a blessing in disguise.

269
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,800
 Well, for anything new to happen,

270
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,240
 there has to be an end to the prior chapter.

271
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,040
 How I may serve in the next season

272
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,720
 is something God will continue to reveal.

273
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,360
 I do eagerly expect that there will be greater things coming.

274
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,520
 And I'm hopeful that I shall share our next move with you

275
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,840
 very soon.

276
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,960
 Now, God willing, I do hope that I

277
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,920
 may be invited once in a long while

278
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,840
 to share a word with all of you.

279
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,360
 Well, beyond personal level in corporate church life,

280
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,240
 there are also occasions that we need

281
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,160
 to bring closure, even to certain ministries,

282
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,560
 so that new fruits can be birthed.

283
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,680
 Our father, the gardener, is in the business of pruning us

284
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,040
 so that we may bear even more fruits.

285
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,440
 However, sometimes we just don't wrap up our past properly.

286
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,800
 How do we know that we are not doing very well?

287
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,840
 Well, when we cannot stop of thinking the past,

288
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,600
 but keep on chewing the hurtful past,

289
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,160
 we feel angry and frustrated because of the sadness

290
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,800
 and pain in our life.

291
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,040
 We struggle to encounter God in those difficult moments.

292
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,040
 And we decline to enter into new commitments in life,

293
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,240
 in relationship, or in ministries.

294
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,680
 Somewhere last year, when I no longer

295
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,720
 received the honorary academic title that

296
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,760
 was conferred to me by the university over the years,

297
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,240
 I was really upset.

298
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,120
 I thought, well, I made very significant contributions

299
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,920
 to the university.

300
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,280
 I thought I had mentored many and inspired others.

301
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,880
 But then I come to my sense.

302
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,960
 I have left the academic field for a good number of years.

303
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,200
 A closure is a closure.

304
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,320
 I can choose to embrace my new role as peers

305
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,240
 to my fellow colleagues, including

306
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,680
 those who are younger than myself,

307
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,560
 but who may be brighter and even more skillful.

308
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,680
 I can choose to fully commit myself to patient care

309
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,520
 on personal levels.

310
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,400
 And I can also explore new ventures in life.

311
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,240
 So how should I embrace closures graciously?

312
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,640
 Well, I learned this spiritual practice

313
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,280
 of writing down my regrets.

314
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,000
 Well, you can actually do it in a beach

315
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
 and let the tide wash it away.

316
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,880
 But that is what I wrote on one of the retreats.

317
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,320
 And that exercise of recognizing the pain, grieving my loss,

318
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,600
 was really helpful.

319
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,800
 So I was in agony that I really felt that I didn't love enough

320
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,560
 and I really didn't do enough.

321
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,280
 But the tide washes everything away.

322
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,360
 And the next day is a new beginning.

323
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,760
 So it may be helpful for us to consider

324
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,240
 the features of emotionally healthy endings

325
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,960
 and new beginnings.

326
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,840
 When we have a healthy ending and new beginnings,

327
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,560
 we know we would be able to wait patiently

328
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,760
 for the ending and the confusion in between before the start.

329
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,320
 We are fully aware that the transition could take much

330
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,640
 longer than we could imagine.

331
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,760
 And we realize that the ending and the waiting

332
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,960
 are closely tied to our personal maturity in Jesus Christ.

333
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,520
 And yet we firmly believe that endings and waiting

334
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,520
 are the gateway to new beginnings.

335
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,200
 If we accept these losses, whether it's

336
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,760
 work, a relationship that comes to an end,

337
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,640
 or even a failed ministry, we are

338
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,400
 ready to enter into a new season.

339
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,520
 Very truly, I tell you, unless a canal of wheat

340
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,640
 falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed.

341
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,560
 But if it dies, it produces many seeds.

342
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,240
 Anyone who loves their life will lose it,

343
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,360
 while anyone who hates their life in this world

344
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,520
 will keep it for eternal life.

345
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,600
 I wonder whether some of us understand what's

346
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,280
 the essence of cancer progression.

347
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,280
 Well, in short, cancer cells do not

348
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,560
 complete their original life cycle at the appropriate time.

349
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,960
 The original normal life design is such

350
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,640
 that cells would just die at a certain time.

351
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,560
 But instead, these cancer cells become vicious cells

352
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,560
 that drag on, and the culprit that endangers life.

353
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,760
 When I was diagnosed with leukemia some years ago,

354
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,600
 the idea of the target therapy that I received

355
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,760
 was to let the medicine to create an environment whereby

356
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,320
 all these cancer cells would die,

357
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,800
 so that healthy cells would reappear in the future.

358
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,080
 I remember the very first day that I received the very first

359
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,600
 dose of the target treatment.

360
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,480
 I literally thought I was going to die,

361
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,320
 because I was so sick.

362
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,040
 But here I am, reasonably strong and healthy.

363
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,320
 Maybe we should all ask ourselves,

364
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,160
 if we accept this ending of my current life situation,

365
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,280
 what new things might be standing in the background,

366
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,160
 waiting to come into my personal life?

367
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,360
 When we embrace the end of a chapter in our lives,

368
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,800
 God's will is not just to change our external circumstances.

369
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,280
 He wants to do a deeper, greater transformation within us

370
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,960
 that goes far beyond our imaginations.

371
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,840
 So this is what Parker Palmer, a famous author, educator, wrote.

372
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,200
 "On the spiritual journey, each time a door closes,

373
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,040
 the rest of the world actually opens up.

374
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,480
 All we need to do is to stop pounding on the door that

375
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,520
 is just closed.

376
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,120
 But instead, we turn around, which

377
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,960
 would put the door behind us, and welcome

378
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:06,920
 the largeness of life that now lies open to our souls."

379
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,480
 Don't pound on a closed door.

380
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,760
 Embrace the new.

381
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,760
 So let's not pound on a closed door and embrace the new.

382
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,080
 How, then, are we able to embark on a new journey?

383
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,760
 Stephen Covey teaches in his best-selling book

384
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,040
 "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."

385
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,240
 And one of the habits is, paradoxically,

386
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,080
 begin with the end in mind.

387
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,040
 Well, maybe Stephen has Paul's encouragement in mind

388
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,880
 when he writes his book, because Paul says,

389
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,560
 "I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it.

390
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,680
 But one thing I do, forgetting what is behind

391
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:58,480
 and straining towards what is ahead, I press on to go."

392
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,240
 So what does it mean to have the end in mind?

393
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,560
 So while we actually just returned

394
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,240
 from a Camino walk in Spain a few weeks ago--

395
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,200
 well, this is the hat that bears the symbol.

396
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,720
 Yes, well, some of you are aware this is exactly the same,

397
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,600
 the Camino walk that Pastor Andrew took.

398
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,680
 Of course, ours is the easier version of five to six days,

399
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,440
 covering around 120 kilometers in total.

400
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,400
 His was 30 days, which covers maybe 20,000.

401
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,640
 I don't know.

402
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,440
 Well, still, it is uncharted water.

403
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,160
 It's uncharted territory for us, myself and my wife.

404
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,480
 And there was some anticipation regarding

405
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,440
 our own physical strength.

406
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,280
 Somehow, due to the flight itinerary,

407
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,800
 we actually flew in to San Diego,

408
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,320
 which is the end point of the supposed Camino journey.

409
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,560
 So we have actually one spare day to tour around San Diego.

410
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,880
 So we tour around.

411
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,440
 We were able to enjoy the very rich history surrounding

412
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,800
 this whole idea of Camino, the story,

413
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,120
 and the glorious ending at the church in San Diego,

414
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,960
 before we actually moved on to our starting point, Sarria,

415
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,320
 to start our journey.

416
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
 So it was interesting.

417
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,520
 But in that sense, we actually began our Camino walk fully

418
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,360
 aware of our glorious ending.

419
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,440
 What remains would be just a full enjoyment of the journey,

420
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,400
 being confident that we shall arrive somehow.

421
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,640
 In his book, Stephen also challenges

422
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:44,880
 us to imagine that we are attending our own funeral.

423
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,200
 And we shall hear from our family, our friends,

424
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,160
 our colleagues, and our fellow congregants

425
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,480
 how they remember us.

426
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
 Well, this is indeed a challenge.

427
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,320
 More often, we would rather ask, well,

428
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,120
 what would be accomplished at the end of this year?

429
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,480
 Or maybe, how would I like my family

430
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,080
 to be in three years' time?

431
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,080
 Where do I expect the ministry to be like in five years?

432
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,080
 Or maybe slightly longer down the road, when I retire,

433
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,320
 what kind of legacy will I leave behind?

434
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,160
 Well, we can and we should set short-term goals on the way

435
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,600
 to long-term life goals.

436
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,320
 But the author reminds us to focus on the very ultimate

437
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,080
 goals that really matter, lest we lean

438
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,880
 the ladder on the wrong wall.

439
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,280
 While I try to practice this principle in my own life,

440
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,640
 we will organize a family gathering with friends

441
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,280
 as well, co-workers, and church members every few years,

442
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,000
 so as to celebrate either our birthdays or our wedding

443
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,120
 anniversary.

444
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,160
 And some of you in this congregation

445
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,080
 did come around to celebrate with us through these events.

446
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,000
 So eight years ago, we celebrated our 21st wedding

447
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,920
 anniversary.

448
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,440
 But we also took a very bold step

449
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,080
 to break the news to our guests that I

450
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,320
 was suffering from leukemia.

451
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,880
 And at that time, I was about to start my treatment.

452
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,320
 So I was charting into unknown waters.

453
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,720
 So I kind of took it as a farewell,

454
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,400
 in case the treatment didn't go very well.

455
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,160
 Well, fast forward on our recent 60th birthday party.

456
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,440
 And that was two years ago, so you can calculate.

457
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,880
 Well, we asked our guests to share something

458
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,640
 they would like to say to us, both as an encouragement

459
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,480
 and as a measure of whether we had

460
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,880
 passed on something really significant for them

461
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,200
 to remember.

462
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,720
 If we think deeply about it, how do I

463
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,160
 want these relatives and friends to evaluate my life?

464
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,720
 What kind of husband, wife, father, or mother

465
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,600
 do we want them to remember?

466
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,840
 What kind of friends, what kind of work partner

467
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,440
 are we for them?

468
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,280
 And what qualities do I want them to see in me?

469
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,480
 Or maybe the ultimate question should

470
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,840
 be, will I be called the good and faithful servant

471
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,520
 that I may be invited to Jesus' banquet to celebrate together?

472
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,560
 If I look closely at the people around me,

473
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,440
 then I should ask, what change do I really

474
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,120
 want to make in their lives?

475
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,480
 And if my ultimate goal is to see life transformed,

476
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,320
 then I should start with my own personal choices,

477
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,400
 my priorities, and my life as a believer.

478
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,720
 So that was when Jesus first called Peter.

479
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,240
 Jesus had already in mind an end for Peter.

480
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,080
 The call to ministry to Peter is such that, well, Jesus said,

481
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,200
 follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

482
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,440
 The original Greek had that sense of making changes

483
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,640
 so that one becomes.

484
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,200
 So it's a continuous process.

485
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,600
 It's a dual process for over three years.

486
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,720
 A call can indeed completely change our destiny.

487
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,160
 About 20 years ago, when I was still working in Singapore,

488
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,040
 I received a phone call from Hong Kong.

489
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,440
 And that was the invitation for me

490
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,240
 to join one of the local universities.

491
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,960
 And we decided to take up the challenge for me

492
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,480
 professionally and for the family to start a new life

493
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,720
 again after a 10-year departure from Hong Kong

494
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,440
 to stay in Singapore.

495
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,560
 And that call changed the path of my life.

496
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,640
 God had a wonderful plan when we returned to Hong Kong.

497
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,640
 And when we were looking for a church,

498
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,960
 we stumbled into Divine Church, which was still

499
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,280
 meeting in Central at the time.

500
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,840
 Vivian and I had the wonderful privilege

501
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,800
 to serve in this church, especially

502
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,680
 in the Chinese ministry where we met Ivan.

503
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,160
 Well, this should be considered a surprising and almost

504
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,120
 unexpected call, right?

505
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,280
 How about Peter?

506
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,480
 What happened to him upon his saying yes to the very first

507
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,600
 call by Jesus?

508
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,120
 Did he continue to keep his end in mind

509
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,240
 while riding many ups and downs together with Jesus

510
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,960
 through those three years?

511
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,640
 After three years of walking alongside and with Jesus,

512
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,280
 Jesus was to depart.

513
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:56,960
 And Jesus allowed that in his absence, Peter and his disciples

514
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,040
 start a new ministry.

515
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,800
 So this is what Jesus encouraged them.

516
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,240
 John 15, "When the advocate comes,

517
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,720
 whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth,

518
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,240
 who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me.

519
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,160
 And you also must testify, bear witness,

520
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,680
 for you have been with me from the beginning."

521
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,880
 Well, long circle, and we are back to the beginning.

522
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,520
 Peter and the first disciples had the privilege

523
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,080
 of being in fellowship with Jesus from the beginning,

524
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,440
 and they had their own unique anointing.

525
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,760
 Vine Church, Yunlong, has been birthed for three years.

526
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,440
 And I understand that Tim is going

527
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,280
 to take his much-needed sabbatical in two months.

528
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,240
 Of course, be assured, he will come back.

529
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,040
 Well, you may have been with this community

530
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,280
 for the past three years from the very beginning,

531
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,680
 or you may have been with us for three months or just three

532
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,840
 weeks.

533
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,640
 Regardless, we are blessed to be part

534
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,480
 of a new season for this church.

535
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,360
 We are moving forward together.

536
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,240
 God values each and every one of us.

537
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,880
 May we spread the good news and keep

538
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,960
 in mind how the end would look like,

539
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,360
 which is a citywide transformation,

540
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,480
 starting from Yunlong but going well beyond.

541
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,440
 Jesus' final instructions to his disciples

542
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,840
 are the same instructions to all of us

543
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,320
 here, brothers and sisters.

544
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,000
 You, too, must bear witness because you have been

545
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,960
 with Jesus from the beginning.

546
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,600
 While our context may differ, but we

547
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,800
 are in a new beginning that God has ordained.

548
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,080
 The New Testament ends beautifully.

549
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,840
 In Revelation, he says, "I am the Alpha and Omega,

550
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,880
 the first and the last, the beginning and the end."

551
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,080
 I hope that as we celebrate a new season of the venture

552
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,360
 of this church and congregation into the uncharted,

553
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,680
 each and every one of us would also

554
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,160
 move towards your life goal.

555
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,040
 My life goal is to give the best of myself

556
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,920
 to serve him in years to come.

557
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,040
 So can I invite you, all of us, to stand together.

558
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,880
 I will also invite the worship team to come.

559
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,920
 Now, while we are preparing for a response in singing,

560
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,560
 I actually want to invite many of you in this congregation

561
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,480
 to do a prophetic act.

562
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,040
 OK, so it's not a magic.

563
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,240
 Not that you do this, then this will happen.

564
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,720
 OK, it's just a declaration.

565
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,480
 Early on, we share, well, we should leave

566
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,560
 the closed door behind us.

567
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,040
 We should turn around.

568
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,920
 And there, we'll see a new beginning.

569
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,960
 So as you ponder on a closure of past chapters,

570
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,440
 we want to turn around and see a new beginning.

571
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,040
 You may want to join me in a moment's time.

572
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,960
 So let's decide how to turn.

573
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,480
 OK, so we'll turn this way.

574
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,760
 OK, so that you don't bump into others.

575
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,680
 OK, so turn this way.

576
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:44,120
 OK, well, but ponder in your hearts and commit to Jesus.

577
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,760
 Well, I want to put a chapter and its closure behind me.

578
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,480
 I want to turn around.

579
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,800
 I want to see a new beginning.
