1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
 So good to be with you this morning.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,920
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here at The Vine.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,120
 And if you're new to The Vine, welcome,

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,960
 we're so glad you're here.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,480
 Maybe you're new to the city,

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,920
 getting settled into Hong Kong.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,560
 And if that's the case and you're looking for a church,

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,960
 there's a lot of great churches in our city,

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,160
 we encourage you to have a look around

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,700
 and experience some of the different churches in the city.

11
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,840
 But if this becomes your home, we're glad that it will be.

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,800
 And we're here to serve and to help you to feel at home

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,240
 as quickly as possible.

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,880
 Maybe you're visiting the city,

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,480
 maybe you're here for the summer.

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,080
 I'm not sure why you came in the summer,

17
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,720
 but you're here for the summer, praise the Lord.

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,460
 You like humidity, glad you're here.

19
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,080
 Maybe you're visiting friends and family,

20
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,800
 we're glad that you are a part of this as well.

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,600
 So welcome to The Vine.

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,080
 I'm really excited this morning

23
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,640
 because I've got a word in my spirit for us.

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,320
 This is a one-off word.

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,080
 Here at The Vine, we predominantly preach in series,

26
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,560
 whether that's a four-week series, an eight-week series,

27
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,600
 a 10-week series, but we normally have a book

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,680
 of the Bible we go through or a theme of the scripture

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,160
 that we wanna explore.

30
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,400
 But every once in a while between the series,

31
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,160
 we have these moments where we can have a one-off

32
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,360
 where I'm able to bring a word to you as a community

33
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,880
 that I've been sensing.

34
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,720
 And you have to pray for me to get through this one

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,560
 without crying.

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,440
 I'm feeling a little bit emotional

37
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,200
 as I come into the pulpit here this morning with you.

38
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,920
 Because this word is one that I feel like the Holy Spirit

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,120
 just has been working in my own life over many years.

40
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,080
 One that I desperately need to hear this morning.

41
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,640
 I feel like I'm gonna be preaching to myself.

42
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
 So I get a bit animated.

43
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,320
 It's because I need to really do some work in myself.

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,760
 Yeah, it's a word for us as a community.

45
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,280
 And I pray that it will be a word that will shape

46
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,600
 something fresh in you here this morning.

47
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,680
 And we wanna lean into ministry here at The Vine.

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,280
 And so after the word, we're gonna have a time

49
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,440
 for ministry together.

50
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,440
 I wanna preach to you from a passage from Matthew.

51
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,680
 Matthew chapter 11, one of Jesus' most beautiful promises.

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,040
 And I wanna read this to you from Matthew 11,

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,960
 verses 28 to 30.

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
 Jesus says this.

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,560
 He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,120
 and I will give you rest."

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,040
 It's not one of the most profoundly beautiful promises

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
 in scripture.

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,960
 He says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,

60
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,080
 for I'm gentle and humble in heart,

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,160
 and you will find rest for your souls.

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,880
 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,000
 Fathers, we open up your scripture here this morning.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,200
 I wanna pray that you would open us to you.

65
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,920
 Father, each one of us comes before you now

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,400
 with whatever weariness or burden we are feeling.

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,720
 And I know that for all of us.

68
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
 I know that for me.

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,040
 Lord, I know that for me.

70
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,320
 I am this way before you.

71
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,960
 Lord, we thank you for your promises in scripture

72
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,320
 that you meet us where we're at.

73
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,000
 And Father, this incredible promise

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,840
 that you will bring rest.

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,600
 Lord, we ask that you would speak to us from your word.

76
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,200
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,640
 Everyone says.

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,360
 This is one of the most famous passages

79
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,960
 that Jesus has in scripture.

80
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,360
 It's one that you've probably heard many times,

81
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,560
 perhaps one that you've seen around the place.

82
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,920
 This is one that's been reproduced

83
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,680
 in lots of cheesy Christian ways as much as possible.

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,960
 Fridge magnets, bumper stickers, t-shirts,

85
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,080
 coffee mugs, you name it.

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,520
 You've probably seen this on Instagram

87
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,720
 in your feed at some point.

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,640
 In fact, I myself posted this to my feed during this week.

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,880
 We see this around a lot.

90
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,280
 It's a famous promise and passage of scripture from Jesus.

91
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,080
 And it's famous for a very important reason.

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,040
 It's famous for a very critical reason

93
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,760
 because Jesus here is speaking of a need

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,560
 that sits within every single human person.

95
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,760
 A need that is deep within us,

96
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,040
 a need that cries out for being met.

97
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,920
 It's a need that I think is even more prevalent now

98
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,960
 in the modern world than even perhaps that it was

99
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,000
 in the time when Jesus spoke it in the first century.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,600
 And it's the need for rest.

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,000
 Oh man, rest.

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,760
 This need to find a place where we can go to deal

103
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,320
 with the fact that we are overwhelmed and stressed

104
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,800
 and exhausted almost all the time.

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,860
 I mean, I don't know about you,

106
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,920
 but this is a word, isn't it, for us?

107
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,280
 It's a word for any of us who knows what it is

108
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,440
 to feel stressed or burnt out or exhausted or overworked

109
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,480
 or that feeling inside of us to need to strive,

110
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,400
 to prove ourselves to others, to make other people love us,

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,240
 to show that we're successful or strong

112
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,960
 or whatever it might be.

113
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,260
 It's a word, isn't it, in season for any of us

114
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,880
 that have ever felt that way

115
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,240
 and probably for the majority of us in this room

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
 who feel that way right now.

117
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,180
 I think actually what Jesus probably should have done

118
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,400
 when he said this is just preface it with,

119
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,240
 and now a word for the people of Hong Kong.

120
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,700
 Come on, church.

121
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,800
 Like a now a word for people of this crazy city

122
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,040
 of the future where everybody's gonna be going

123
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,880
 and going and going.

124
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,280
 Everybody's gonna be trying to earn and create and produce,

125
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,240
 and they're gonna be overworked, overstimulated,

126
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,280
 overstressed, but the people of Hong Kong, come to me.

127
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,840
 All you who are weary and burdened,

128
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,080
 and I will give you rest.

129
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,320
 And we hear this word,

130
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,080
 and something inside of us cries out, doesn't it,

131
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,280
 and says, that's a word for me.

132
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,440
 Oh, yes and amen.

133
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,040
 Lord, give me more.

134
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,360
 The problem is, the problem is,

135
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,440
 is that what we think Jesus is speaking about here

136
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,720
 isn't actually what Jesus is speaking about.

137
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,160
 In fact, another way of saying it is,

138
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,340
 what we want Jesus to be speaking about here

139
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,160
 is not actually what Jesus is speaking about.

140
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,660
 What we hope Jesus is speaking about

141
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,200
 is not actually what he's speaking about.

142
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,580
 Because if you read this from a modern context,

143
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,280
 like we all so naturally do,

144
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,160
 open up Matthew 11, read this passage from the lens

145
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,560
 and the thought of our modern world.

146
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
 When we hear Jesus say, come to me,

147
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,880
 all you who are weary and burdened,

148
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,200
 and I will give you rest.

149
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,320
 Here's what we hear.

150
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,480
 We hear permanent vacation.

151
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,680
 We hear this excitement in our hearts

152
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,260
 'cause we hear, great, Jesus is inviting us

153
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,180
 to drinks on a beach in Bali.

154
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,740
 Like, that's what I need.

155
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,120
 'Cause Jesus knows that I'm overworked,

156
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,080
 overstimulated, overproducing.

157
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,040
 He knows that I'm striving so hard to do all these things.

158
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,840
 He knows that the one thing I need

159
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,760
 is just to get rid of it all,

160
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,320
 get it all out of my life,

161
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,240
 get myself to the point where I have no responsibilities,

162
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,640
 no work, no stress, no burden,

163
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,440
 and I can be come by ironing with Jesus forever.

164
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,400
 So we read this and he says rest,

165
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,960
 and we're thinking the cessation of everything,

166
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,820
 particularly the cessation of work,

167
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,160
 because work is what is exhausting me.

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,980
 Relationships are exhausting me.

169
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,800
 Trying to prove myself is exhausting me.

170
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,160
 I mean, if I can just get rid of all of that stuff,

171
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,600
 if I can cease my work

172
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,440
 and just take a permanent vacation with Jesus,

173
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,340
 let's get rid of Martha and let's be merry forever.

174
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,320
 Like, that's how we read this passage.

175
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,960
 And we get excited 'cause we think

176
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
 Jesus is inviting us to a holiday,

177
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,420
 but Jesus is doing everything but inviting you to a holiday.

178
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:32,200
 In fact, what Jesus is inviting us to

179
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,120
 is something so much grander, so much more beautiful,

180
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,920
 so much more profound,

181
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,240
 so much more life transforming

182
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,440
 than just a simple break from it all.

183
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,160
 And in fact, when you catch a glimpse,

184
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,180
 just a little glimpse of what it is

185
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,880
 that Jesus is inviting us to in this scripture,

186
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,840
 here's the reaction we find.

187
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,720
 We find ourselves no longer needing to escape the world,

188
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,520
 but desperately wanting to lean into the world.

189
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,880
 Come on, church.

190
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,200
 When we really understand what Jesus is asking here

191
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,300
 and offering here,

192
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,880
 we find ourselves being liberated, in fact,

193
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,520
 from the desire to wanna kind of get rid of the world

194
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,840
 and set the world aside and cease everything.

195
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,440
 And we actually find ourselves going, how do I do more?

196
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,480
 How do I lean in?

197
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,520
 How do I serve?

198
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,400
 How do I partner with God for the kingdom in this world?

199
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,280
 And we find ourselves going from a, I need a vacation

200
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,620
 to saying, Lord, give me life.

201
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,440
 Oh, I'm glad I'm the only one here

202
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,080
 who's excited this morning.

203
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,400
 Come on, church.

204
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
 'Cause you're not excited, and I get it,

205
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,160
 because we're tired.

206
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,460
 We're exhausted.

207
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,800
 And the idea of a break from it all

208
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,120
 sounds like what we need.

209
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,280
 And Jesus says, I'm not giving you rest from your work.

210
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,480
 I'm giving you rest for your soul.

211
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,680
 Oh, for the thing that really needs it.

212
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,520
 You gotta understand that when Jesus says these words,

213
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,400
 he's not actually speaking to the church in Hong Kong.

214
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,960
 He's not actually speaking to some future city

215
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,440
 that's gonna be stressed out and burnt out.

216
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,840
 He's speaking to a bunch of farmers in Galilee.

217
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,240
 He's speaking to a bunch of people

218
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,720
 who were just average, normal people.

219
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,920
 He's speaking to a bunch of people

220
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,600
 who are living in a time of empire,

221
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
 people who are under the oppression

222
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,640
 of a much larger, bigger power and force.

223
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,400
 He's speaking to Jewish people,

224
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,720
 to Jewish people who understood the Old Testament scriptures

225
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,400
 and the narrative of God, who, when they heard Jesus say rest,

226
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,480
 they're not thinking beach, barley, and a pina colada.

227
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,560
 They're thinking this could be the Messiah.

228
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,480
 They're thinking to themselves,

229
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,080
 we understand what the Bible has always been saying

230
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,000
 about this idea of one day God stepping back into the world

231
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,960
 and bringing life again to a weary and broken world.

232
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,760
 And here's one who's saying, come to me,

233
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,720
 and I will give you that kind of release,

234
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,160
 that kind of rest that isn't just gonna be sold

235
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,480
 by some physical ceasing of activity,

236
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,240
 but the sort of rest that is gonna magically

237
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,840
 transform your life forever.

238
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,960
 And they're thinking to themselves,

239
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,760
 could this one be actually the Son of God?

240
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,840
 So to understand what Jesus was meaning here by rest

241
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,040
 and how that will totally transform your thinking

242
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,880
 about your need for rest,

243
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,800
 we have to go all the way back

244
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,480
 to my favorite three chapters of the scripture.

245
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,400
 Does anybody know what my favorite

246
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,640
 three chapters of the scripture are?

247
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,280
 I know Tony does 'cause he's already laughing about it.

248
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,040
 Anyone else know my favorite three chapters of scripture?

249
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,760
 Genesis, which ones?

250
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,120
 One, two, three, amen, Jennifer, star.

251
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,480
 She's on staff, that doesn't count, but star.

252
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,960
 My favorite three chapters of scripture,

253
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,800
 Genesis one, two, and three,

254
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,840
 because within there we see God do so much

255
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,160
 to create what he wants in this world

256
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,240
 and the travesty of how sin breaks it

257
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,720
 and then the longing for it to be renewed.

258
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,640
 So if we wanna understand what Jesus is speaking about here

259
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,800
 when he's saying, I can give you rest for your soul,

260
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,440
 we gotta go all the way back to Genesis one and two.

261
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,360
 The beautiful thing about Genesis one and two

262
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,320
 is in there we see a picture of God's creation of the world,

263
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,400
 the way in which he creates and shapes the world.

264
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,280
 And we saw this quite a bit in our series on justice

265
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,160
 just this past month.

266
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,680
 But the pinnacle of that creation, of course,

267
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,120
 is the creation of humanity,

268
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,200
 this climactic work that he creates

269
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,040
 and he places us as his image.

270
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
 And notice what he does,

271
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,920
 he then places us within the garden

272
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,840
 and then he speaks powerfully two things.

273
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,360
 He speaks and demonstrates two things

274
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,240
 that are basically the two essential things

275
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
 that human beings need for flourishing.

276
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,280
 If you're taking notes, and you should be taking notes,

277
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,640
 and you can use your phone in here

278
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,720
 but not be on Instagram, YouTube or anything like that,

279
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,400
 but if you're taking notes, mark this down,

280
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,280
 I'm gonna now teach you the two essential things

281
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,920
 that every human being needs for flourishing.

282
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,720
 In Genesis one and two, the Lord creates this force.

283
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,240
 These are two rhythms that if you can get right in your life

284
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,480
 will cause you to flourish.

285
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,640
 The first is the rhythm of work

286
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,800
 and the second is the rhythm of rest.

287
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,240
 First, let's start with the idea of the rhythm of work.

288
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,640
 God creates humanity

289
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,040
 and he doesn't invite humanity into Bali on vacation.

290
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,560
 He creates humanity and he places humanity into a garden.

291
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,480
 And he says to humanity in that garden,

292
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,440
 he says, "Look around this creation I've created you,

293
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,800
 "you're made in my image.

294
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,040
 "Now I want you to partner with me, being image of me,

295
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,600
 "I want you to partner with me

296
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,840
 "in the kind of flourishing of creation that is around you."

297
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,040
 So it's an invitation to work,

298
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,960
 work in partnership with God

299
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,400
 so that we can take his creation

300
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,520
 and bring that creation into its greatest expression

301
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,960
 in the same way that when God created,

302
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,800
 the Holy Spirit took something that was formless,

303
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,720
 gave it form and brought it into its fullness.

304
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,120
 Now God takes humanity, places it in the garden

305
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,240
 and it says, "Do the same.

306
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,160
 "You're made in my image.

307
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,000
 "Now I want you to partner with me

308
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,880
 "in enabling creation to find its fullness

309
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,960
 "and its flourishing.

310
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,400
 "There's work for you to do."

311
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,480
 And that in those days was that work of planting,

312
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,720
 of preparing the soil, of watering, of growing,

313
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,000
 of reaping crop, of making the world produce its fruit.

314
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,960
 Adam and Eve are given work that not only flourishes them,

315
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,880
 but flourishes creation around them.

316
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,960
 And God steps back and says, "That's good."

317
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,240
 There's a rhythm of work that's important for us to know

318
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,480
 that was there before sin came to the picture.

319
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,960
 The second rhythm he creates is the rhythm of rest.

320
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,520
 Can I have an amen?

321
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,880
 It's not all work, you also get rest.

322
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,280
 And in creating this rhythm of rest,

323
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,960
 God does so by demonstrating and doing it in two ways.

324
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,120
 First of all, he does it through the order

325
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
 by which he creates.

326
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,680
 I wonder if you've ever recognized this,

327
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,040
 but in Genesis 1 and 2,

328
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,360
 when God gets to the end of his created day,

329
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,720
 he says this phrase, he says,

330
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,400
 "And then there was night and there was day the first day."

331
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
 Or it says, "And then there was evening and morning

332
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,960
 "the second day, evening and morning the third day."

333
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,840
 Which if you stop for a moment and read it,

334
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,600
 you would realize, isn't that around the wrong way?

335
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,440
 Like, shouldn't it be,

336
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,400
 "And then there was day and night the first day."

337
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,280
 But you gotta understand that when God creates,

338
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,240
 he creates a rhythm of rest where he says,

339
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,640
 "You wanna know how human beings flourish?

340
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,480
 "There was evening and there was morning the first day."

341
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,160
 In other words, this is how human beings flourish.

342
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,080
 They flourish working out of rest, not into rest.

343
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,600
 Oh, may that change your life.

344
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
 Because here's how we all work.

345
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,140
 We desperately work into rest, don't we?

346
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,920
 Like we work really hard, really hard, really hard,

347
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,640
 but it's okay because we booked that trip to Bali

348
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,520
 and we're gonna be on that beach

349
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,040
 and we're gonna drink that pina colada,

350
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,520
 but we're working, working, working, working, working

351
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,360
 so that we can get to our vacation, collapse on the beach

352
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,920
 and go, "Thank goodness I'm alive."

353
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,320
 We work into rest on a daily basis.

354
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,880
 You work really hard in your work

355
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
 and then you get home to watch Netflix.

356
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,040
 We work into rest,

357
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,440
 but God's created the world to work out of rest.

358
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,280
 He's like, "You wanna know what it is

359
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,520
 "to flourish as human beings?

360
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,720
 "Work out how rest becomes a propelling into what is good

361
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,800
 "rather than rest being where you go when you're exhausted."

362
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,520
 I learned this a few years ago because in my early years,

363
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,080
 I was a banker and I worked for an investment bank.

364
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,240
 I was pretty stressed when I was a banker

365
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,640
 working in investment banking,

366
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,200
 but I had never experienced stress

367
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,520
 until I'd become a pastor.

368
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,320
 You are all very stressful.

369
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,280
 So I became very stressed when I became a pastor.

370
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,000
 Over a few years, I recognized that I was having a big toll

371
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,360
 on my physical health.

372
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,840
 It was a big toll on my physical health

373
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,160
 because everything was beginning to work in my body

374
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,760
 and in my system in a bad way.

375
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,520
 I started getting irritable bowel syndrome.

376
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,560
 My stomach was really bad.

377
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,200
 And it got to the point where I had to go to a doctor.

378
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,120
 And I went to the doctor and I said to the doctor,

379
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
 "Look, I think I might have stomach cancer.

380
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,960
 "There's something going on.

381
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,840
 "I don't know what it is."

382
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,240
 And the doctor's like, "Well, let's do some tests."

383
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,080
 We did some tests.

384
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,040
 And I came back and he's like, "You're perfectly fine.

385
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,320
 "Physically, you're absolutely fine.

386
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,560
 "There's nothing in your stomach.

387
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,680
 "There's nothing there at all."

388
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,360
 So I'm like, "Well, doctor, what's going on?"

389
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,920
 He's like, "Well, tell me about your work week."

390
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,960
 So I told him, I'm like, "Well, I start work on Tuesdays

391
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,240
 "and I work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

392
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,880
 "Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

393
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,440
 "And then Sunday's my busiest day.

394
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,600
 "And it's a crazy day.

395
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,080
 "And by the time I finish all the sermons

396
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,440
 "and all the services and everything,

397
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,720
 "I collapse into Monday.

398
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,040
 "Monday's my day off, praise the Lord."

399
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,680
 And he's like, "So you're telling me you work into rest?"

400
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,080
 He's like, "You should be working out of rest."

401
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,000
 I'm like, "What do you mean?"

402
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,400
 He's like, "Don't have a day off on Monday.

403
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,640
 "Have a day off on Friday."

404
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,680
 I'm like, "You don't understand.

405
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,960
 "I can't, like, the rhythm in our office,

406
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,000
 "we have days off on Monday.

407
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,840
 "We don't have..."

408
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,000
 He's like, "Who's the boss?"

409
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,360
 (congregation laughing)

410
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,120
 Jesus?

411
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,640
 I said, "Well, I'm kind of the boss."

412
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,200
 He's like, "Well, then change it."

413
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,960
 So I did, I changed my day off from Monday to Friday.

414
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,880
 And as soon as I changed my day off from Friday,

415
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,120
 what it means is now I work Sunday, Monday,

416
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,520
 Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is my day off.

417
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,640
 Saturday I work if I need to,

418
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,800
 if there's a wedding or whatever.

419
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,120
 And then I come in on Sunday.

420
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,800
 And you gotta believe it that I'm working now

421
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
 out of a place of rest.

422
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,640
 So when I come in on a Sunday, man, I'm fired up.

423
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,520
 I'm ready to go.

424
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,840
 Like, I'm so excited.

425
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,800
 And I know, I know that all of you are exhausted

426
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,800
 and you don't feel like I do and I get it.

427
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,520
 And you're gonna wanna go to work tomorrow

428
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,680
 and ask your boss for Friday off.

429
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,040
 It's not gonna work probably for you.

430
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,000
 But I want you to hear the scripture here.

431
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,360
 What God is saying is that there's an ordained rhythm

432
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,680
 in this world where if you can somehow change your attitude

433
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,440
 and your thinking, somehow change the rhythms of your work

434
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,360
 and begin to think I'm working out of a place of rest,

435
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,160
 not working into a place of rest,

436
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,880
 you will find the greatest flourishing

437
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,280
 that God has ever given you.

438
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,440
 Just a few months later, my stomach cleared up.

439
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,960
 No IBS, never had it ever since.

440
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,840
 I'm still as stressed as I ever was.

441
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,360
 But I'm working from a place of rest,

442
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,960
 not working into a place of rest.

443
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,560
 So that's the first thing that the Lord does.

444
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,600
 Here's the second thing he does.

445
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,560
 Right at the end on the seventh day,

446
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,800
 the Bible gives us this beautiful thing.

447
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,480
 It says, "And then he rested from all of his work."

448
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,240
 So on the seventh day, the Lord does nothing, if you will.

449
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,080
 He rests.

450
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,360
 Now the Hebrew word there for rest

451
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,680
 is actually the word for cease.

452
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,240
 So what he does here is he ceases from his work.

453
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,120
 Now, it's easy for us to project the idea of Sabbath

454
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,840
 into this moment, but we have to stop from doing that

455
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,800
 because Sabbath, this is the moment that drives the idea

456
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,440
 and the institution of Sabbath,

457
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,200
 which comes later in Exodus with the law that's given

458
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,840
 and the way that God works with the Jewish people

459
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
 in their freedom.

460
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,680
 And Sabbath gets instituted because of this moment.

461
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,560
 But what you've got to realize is that in this moment,

462
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,840
 God is not Sabbathing because he's exhausted.

463
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,480
 He didn't get to the end of those six days of creation

464
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,080
 and go, "Oh my goodness, I'm so tired, so weary, so burdened.

465
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,600
 I need to sit down for a moment

466
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,680
 and just breathe it all in," right?

467
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,440
 He gets to the end of his week, and here's the thing.

468
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
 He's not tired and exhausted so he needs rest.

469
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,240
 He ceases his work because nothing more needs to be done.

470
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,760
 In other words, the world is just

471
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,000
 as he always envisioned it to be.

472
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,640
 It's operating how he's always wanted it to be.

473
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,760
 Like a painter, think of it this way.

474
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,240
 Like a painter who's been spending months

475
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,960
 putting paint on a canvas and brushing brushstrokes,

476
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,840
 and then at the end of those months,

477
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,200
 finally puts the last brush on the painting

478
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,440
 and steps back and looks at the painting and goes,

479
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,720
 "Oh my goodness, it's done,"

480
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,800
 and then puts the paintbrush down.

481
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,680
 Not because they're tired and exhausted

482
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,840
 and it's all been bad,

483
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,440
 but because there's this glorious picture in front

484
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
 that is just how they always dreamed it to be

485
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,800
 and nothing more needs to be added.

486
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,240
 Are you with me?

487
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,320
 So the Lord rests, ceases,

488
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,840
 because everything is just as it is to be.

489
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,240
 This, my friends, is the idea of shalom.

490
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,800
 What we see actually at the end

491
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,360
 of the creation narrative of Genesis 1 and 2

492
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
 is not the institution of Sabbath.

493
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,960
 It is the exclamation of shalom.

494
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,480
 So when we go back to Matthew 11

495
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,680
 and Jesus says, "Come to me,

496
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,120
 "all you who are weary and burdened,

497
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,560
 "and I will give you rest,"

498
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,160
 Jesus is not speaking about Sabbath rest.

499
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,640
 He's not speaking in that passage about,

500
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,480
 "Man, I know you're tired, you just need a day off.

501
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,680
 "We're gonna give you a day off

502
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,800
 "and then we're gonna get back into it."

503
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,520
 He's actually not talking about Sabbath.

504
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,920
 Jesus speaks about Sabbath in lots of other places

505
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,000
 and He actually redeems and reconstructs what Sabbath is.

506
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,360
 He does that, but in this moment, it's not about Sabbath.

507
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,120
 This is about shalom.

508
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,120
 This is why He says, "It's a rest for your souls."

509
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,520
 In other words, what Jesus is doing

510
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
 is going right back to Genesis 1 and 2

511
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,040
 and He's seeing the picture of these rhythms

512
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
 that have been created for humanity to flourish,

513
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,160
 the rhythm of work and the rhythm of rest,

514
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,760
 and how we are to operate out of a place of rest

515
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,400
 into the world that He's created

516
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,000
 so that we can do the good works that He's placed upon us.

517
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,720
 And He sees a burnt out and exhausted group of people.

518
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,440
 And He says, "There is the rest

519
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,120
 "that Scripture has longed for,

520
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,440
 "that it spoke about in Genesis 1 and 2."

521
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,960
 He says, "If you come to me when you're weary and burdened,

522
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,560
 "I will give you shalom.

523
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,720
 "I will give you this kind of rest,

524
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,280
 "not just a break from your work

525
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
 "so that you can go back and be more stressed,

526
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,040
 "but actually a change within you

527
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,000
 "that will forever bring you into a place of peace."

528
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,320
 And He's like, "I want you to operate out of peace."

529
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,000
 But then Genesis 3 happens.

530
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Genesis 3 changes everything again,

531
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,920
 because there's Adam and Eve,

532
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,760
 and they take of that fruit

533
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,280
 from the knowledge of the tree of good and evil,

534
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
 and everything changes.

535
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,840
 Sin enters the situation,

536
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,920
 and those rhythms that were created

537
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,440
 for the flourishing of humanity,

538
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,360
 the rhythm of work and the rhythm of rest

539
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,640
 is totally changed in that moment.

540
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,680
 And those four relational contexts

541
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,520
 that we've been speaking about

542
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,120
 in this Justice series just recently,

543
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,960
 us with God, us with ourselves,

544
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,920
 us with others, us with creation,

545
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,720
 those four things are completely changed in that moment.

546
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,920
 All of them are disrupted and broken,

547
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,960
 and life is never the same again.

548
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,360
 And in this reality of sin,

549
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,520
 both the pleasure of work

550
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,520
 and the reality of rest are disrupted.

551
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,720
 Let me show you specifically

552
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,760
 how this happens from Genesis 3.

553
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,600
 I wanna show you verses just 19 to 20.

554
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,120
 He says this.

555
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,840
 He says, sorry, 17, we're gonna start in 17.

556
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,400
 He says, "Cursed is the ground because of you.

557
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,560
 "Through painful toil, you will eat of it

558
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,040
 "all the days of your life.

559
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,400
 "It will produce thorns and thistles for you,

560
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,560
 "and you will eat the plants of the field.

561
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,800
 "By the sweat of your brow, you will eat your food,

562
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,760
 "and you will return to the ground.

563
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,880
 "Since from it you are taken.

564
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,880
 "For dust you are, and to dust you will return."

565
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,840
 God shows up in the garden post-sin,

566
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,760
 and there's Adam and Eve,

567
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,480
 and they are broken in their relationship with him,

568
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,320
 in their relationship with themselves,

569
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,200
 their relationship with others,

570
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,400
 their relationship with creation.

571
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,720
 And in the disarray of all that sin,

572
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,560
 God shows up and says,

573
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,680
 you've gotta understand that there are consequences to that.

574
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,120
 You've gotta understand that now things

575
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
 are going to be differently.

576
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,760
 And he says, "The curse, the ground is now cursed,"

577
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,000
 notice, "because of you."

578
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,760
 And suddenly, where work was a rhythm

579
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,920
 designed for humanity to bring it into flourishing,

580
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,440
 now work is going to do these things.

581
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,600
 It's gonna be a toil of pain on you.

582
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,840
 There are gonna be thorns and thistles at work.

583
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,960
 It's gonna be the sweat of your brow.

584
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,360
 It's gonna be exhausting and tiring and bickering,

585
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,760
 and it's not gonna work out

586
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,240
 how you thought it was gonna work out.

587
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,080
 Sin has so broken it.

588
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,880
 And I want you to see something really important here.

589
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,080
 What God is saying is not that work is evil,

590
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,280
 but that we are evil.

591
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,480
 Not that work is sinful, but that we are sinful.

592
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,600
 And because we are sinful, suddenly everything has changed,

593
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,680
 and no longer what was supposed to bring us into flourishing

594
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,600
 now is gonna feel like it's sucking life from us.

595
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,040
 This is profound.

596
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,880
 Think about it in the four relational contexts

597
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,400
 that we've been speaking about.

598
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,120
 See, when our relationship with God breaks,

599
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,480
 here's what happens.

600
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,040
 We don't like that.

601
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,520
 We feel alone and we feel left behind,

602
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,360
 and here's what we do as human beings.

603
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,840
 When that relationship breaks,

604
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,640
 we try to become God ourselves.

605
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,640
 We take on board for ourselves the control of the world.

606
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,240
 Rather than leaving that to God,

607
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,440
 we begin to take it on ourselves.

608
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,400
 We say, "Well, I guess I need to provide for myself.

609
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,440
 "I need to work hard.

610
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,800
 "I need to provide for my family.

611
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,880
 "I need to be in control.

612
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,560
 "I need to make sure that everything is perfect,

613
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,720
 "just the way it should be."

614
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,840
 And we wonder why we're exhausted.

615
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,560
 And when our relationship with ourselves breaks

616
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
 because of sin, here's the reality.

617
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,360
 Suddenly the Bible has this kind of definition.

618
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,120
 It says that we suddenly get this orphan spirit in us.

619
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,960
 And the orphan spirit is because we feel like

620
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,720
 God has left us, so we feel like we are abandoned

621
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,160
 in this world, and because of that,

622
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,880
 we begin to do all that we can to plug the gap

623
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,480
 of that abandonment.

624
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,400
 So we try to prove ourselves.

625
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,080
 We try to show the world that we are deserving

626
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,040
 of being loved.

627
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,800
 We try to work hard so that people think,

628
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,080
 "Oh, we're successful."

629
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,160
 We wanna project an image,

630
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,960
 even though we know deep down inside we're still broken.

631
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,720
 The orphan spirit causes us to prove ourselves,

632
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,400
 and we're wondering why we're exhausted.

633
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,960
 And then when our relationship with others breaks down

634
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,760
 because we no longer have that relationship

635
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,680
 with God, we no longer have the security in ourselves,

636
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,160
 we start looking for security in the people around us.

637
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,960
 We overdate.

638
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,120
 We get into too many relationships.

639
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,080
 We're seeking for somebody to make us feel good,

640
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,320
 somebody to try to love us,

641
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,440
 somebody that we think that we can kind of

642
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,920
 be their best friend or be in relationship with them

643
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,760
 in a way that's gonna make us feel good

644
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,280
 about the brokenness in ourselves.

645
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,760
 And so we're using people to plug the hole in ourselves,

646
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,080
 and we wonder why we're exhausted.

647
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,560
 And then when our relationship with creation breaks down,

648
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,520
 two things will happen.

649
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,880
 Either we'll just not care about creation,

650
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,520
 we'll avoid it, we'll exploit it,

651
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,320
 we'll treat it how we want,

652
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,440
 and therefore in the long term we will suffer.

653
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,240
 Or we do the opposite.

654
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,960
 We worship creation.

655
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,200
 We look for creation as our salvation.

656
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,520
 We turn to creation as the place

657
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,800
 that's gonna redeem and renew us,

658
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,920
 and we begin to worship it through new age

659
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,600
 and the worship of mother nature

660
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,120
 and getting in touch with the spiritual essence

661
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
 of nature around us.

662
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,080
 And we think that that's where it's all gonna go,

663
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,840
 and we wonder why we're exhausted.

664
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,960
 This, my friends, is what I would call a striving mentality.

665
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,080
 And every single one of us,

666
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,240
 the reason why we are exhausted

667
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,800
 is not because you work hard, and I'm sure you do,

668
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,880
 and I'm sure hard work is tiring.

669
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,080
 The reason why you're really exhausted

670
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,760
 is because of your striving.

671
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,680
 You see, where we were once operating

672
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,680
 out of a place of rest into a place of thriving before sin,

673
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,760
 now we're operating out of a place of disorder

674
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,240
 into a place of striving because of sin.

675
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,400
 Are you with me?

676
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,720
 So before where we had this beautiful rhythm

677
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,600
 of work and rest and no sin to break it down,

678
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,840
 we felt fully alive,

679
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,440
 now we're trying to plug all the gaps ourselves.

680
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,880
 We're trying to reach out and find ways

681
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,640
 to feel better about our brokenness.

682
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,920
 We're trying to ensure that no one else around us

683
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,960
 sees what's truly going on inside,

684
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,840
 and we're in this place of doing all of that

685
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,040
 in our own strength,

686
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,920
 and it's because we are striving and driving

687
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,960
 to try to prove when actually that's just leading us

688
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,400
 into a place of greater and greater exhaustion.

689
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,160
 And when all of this sits together in one,

690
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,080
 we begin to understand why it is that Jesus says

691
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,520
 what He says to those people in Galilee

692
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,880
 back in the first century, all those years ago.

693
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,920
 You see, whenever we try to strive

694
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,360
 to restore what is broken inside of us because of our sin,

695
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,000
 and we look to any other source

696
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,240
 other than Jesus Himself to do that,

697
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,720
 you will only ever become more and more exhausted

698
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,400
 and less and less free.

699
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,920
 Come on church.

700
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,960
 That's the reality of what our world is like.

701
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,560
 That's the reality of all of our lives.

702
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,360
 If we try to plug and restore in any other source

703
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,040
 other than Jesus, we're only gonna get more exhausted.

704
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,160
 We're only gonna get more and more less free,

705
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,640
 more bound, more enslaved, more exploited,

706
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,720
 more tired, more exhausted.

707
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,720
 Our life is not gonna look how it was meant to be.

708
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,160
 And so Jesus shows up to these burnt out,

709
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,560
 exhausted, tired people in Galilee,

710
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,160
 and He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened.

711
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,880
 "I will give you rest."

712
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,200
 I wonder if that takes on now

713
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,000
 a slightly different perspective.

714
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,960
 Jesus is not offering a holiday to Bali

715
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,000
 as good as holidays to Bali are.

716
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,320
 He's offering something much more important,

717
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,080
 a freedom within yourself

718
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,360
 where you're operating out of rest, not into rest,

719
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,840
 where you found peace in a way that truly is transformative,

720
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,040
 where even your work begins to find fresh life.

721
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,200
 Notice what He says.

722
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,080
 He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened."

723
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,600
 The word weary here literally means

724
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,160
 to toil to a point of exhaustion,

725
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,600
 to try in our own strength to achieve.

726
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,400
 The word burden here means to carry a heavy weight upon us,

727
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,680
 to be overburdened by responsibilities and life.

728
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,120
 Jesus only uses these two words here in all of the Gospels.

729
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,080
 Never mentions these words ever again.

730
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,640
 It's just in this teaching

731
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,320
 'cause He's trying to touch that striving mentality

732
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,040
 that we all hold because of sin.

733
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,440
 And the reality that we're weighed down and burdened

734
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,680
 by the heaviness of life.

735
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,320
 And He says, "This is human experience,

736
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,800
 but it does not have to be.

737
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,840
 This is human experience weighed down by sin.

738
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,320
 But I have gone to the cross, I have raised again,

739
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,720
 I have liberated, I've set the world free.

740
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,760
 If you come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,

741
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,200
 I will give you that rest,

742
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,000
 a rest that will renew your spirit in your life

743
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,320
 so that you're not trying to escape the world

744
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,800
 because you're exhausted,

745
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,400
 you're leaning in because you're excited."

746
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:08,000
 I love how He says here, "Come to me."

747
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,400
 Simple.

748
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,840
 Jesus does not offer a 12-step plan

749
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,040
 to be able to manage the stress better in your life.

750
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,520
 He does not offer a strategy

751
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,880
 to help you to reduce your striving

752
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,120
 so that you can feel a little bit better.

753
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,680
 He's not trying to give you like a roadmap

754
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,600
 so that you can just get to your next vacation

755
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,800
 and feel a little bit better

756
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,440
 and then get back into the rat race.

757
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,560
 No, He's not doing that.

758
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,080
 Jesus does not want you to manage your striving.

759
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,200
 He wants you to eliminate striving.

760
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,880
 He wants you to be completely free

761
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,680
 from the thing that is weighing you down.

762
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,880
 So He says these beautiful words.

763
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,200
 He says, "Come to me."

764
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
 In other words, relationship with Him

765
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,480
 is what sets us free from that striving,

766
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,880
 recognizing that on the cross,

767
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,840
 He paid the price for the heaviness and the weight of sin,

768
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,160
 that in His resurrection,

769
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,720
 He offers grace and freedom from anyone

770
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,360
 who can turn towards Him.

771
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,320
 And He says to everybody, "Just come to me.

772
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,600
 I'm not hard to find," He's saying.

773
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,160
 You don't have to go on some big, long pilgrimage search.

774
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,320
 All you literally do is need to say,

775
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,120
 "Jesus, would you help me?"

776
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,480
 In other words, He's saying, "I'm available right here,

777
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,120
 right now, today, for whatever it is

778
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,080
 that is weighing you down, burdening you,

779
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,280
 strength, kind of that pressure upon you.

780
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,160
 I am here to set you free."

781
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,000
 Notice what He says.

782
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,120
 He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened."

783
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,640
 He didn't say, "Come to me

784
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,360
 when you're feeling better about yourself."

785
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,480
 He didn't say, "Come to me when everything's going right,

786
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,640
 when you've dealt with some stuff,

787
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,320
 when you've offloaded some of the weight,

788
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,400
 then come to me."

789
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,000
 No, He says, "Come to me just as you are right now."

790
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,920
 It's like Jesus is saying,

791
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,160
 "The only qualification you need

792
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,880
 to be in relationship with me is weariness and burden."

793
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,120
 And if you feel weary and burdened and exhausted and tired

794
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,800
 and overworked and overstimulated

795
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,400
 and feel like you're at the end of yourself,

796
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,720
 well, then you're primed for relationship with Jesus.

797
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,720
 The needier you are, the more perfect you are for Jesus.

798
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,400
 Come on, church.

799
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,480
 The needier you are, the more perfect you are for Jesus,

800
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,240
 for what He wants to do in your life.

801
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,400
 He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary

802
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,160
 and burdened right now, and I will give you rest."

803
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,200
 Not in the future,

804
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,080
 not in some kind of thing that's down the line,

805
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,880
 not after you've done a five-step program,

806
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
 not after you've done 12 Bible studies.

807
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,160
 I'm gonna give you rest right now.

808
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,080
 And that rest is gonna set you free.

809
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,600
 That rest is gonna change it all.

810
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,880
 And you might still need some physical break

811
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
 from time to time,

812
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,280
 but when you get the kind of rest I'm talking about,

813
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,440
 the kind of rest that goes into your soul,

814
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,240
 your primary purpose in life is not to work, to rest.

815
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,960
 Your primary purpose in life is to rest, to work.

816
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,320
 Come on, church.

817
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,200
 And what kind of work?

818
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,680
 The Sermon on the Mount, the Great Commission.

819
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,760
 And yes, being a banker and a lawyer and a teacher

820
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
 and a graphic designer and a nurse and a doctor

821
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,920
 and whatever it is that you might be in this room,

822
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,520
 all of that work has value.

823
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,480
 All of that work can produce the world

824
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,080
 to be a flourishing place,

825
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,000
 like the rhythm that it was created to be

826
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,440
 in Genesis 1 and 2.

827
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,240
 But the only way you get there is through Jesus Christ.

828
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,360
 Otherwise, you are stuck in your striving,

829
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,720
 in your sin, in your brokenness,

830
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,160
 in that orphan spirit trying to get everybody to like you.

831
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,280
 There is nothing more exhausting

832
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,440
 than trying to get people to like you

833
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,200
 because you don't really probably at times are easy to like.

834
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,760
 But guess what?

835
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,960
 Jesus likes you, loves you,

836
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,400
 loves you just the way you are right now.

837
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,840
 Doesn't love the brokenness or the sin that's in our lives,

838
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,880
 but loves you and sees you free

839
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,880
 and says, "All you have to do is come to me."

840
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,600
 He then says this word, he says,

841
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,120
 and this is quite funny.

842
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,000
 He says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,

843
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,040
 "for I'm gentle and humble in heart,

844
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,320
 "and you will find rest for your souls,

845
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,440
 "for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

846
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,280
 I love this.

847
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,160
 He says, "Take my yoke upon you,"

848
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,440
 which is really bizarre, so counterintuitive.

849
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,520
 It seems actually counterproductive

850
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,320
 'cause Jesus has said, "Come to me and I will give you rest."

851
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,080
 And now he said, "Take my yoke."

852
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,440
 It's like, hang on, Jesus, what is it?

853
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,760
 Is it rest or work?

854
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,560
 Is it rest or freedom or rest?

855
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,080
 You can't tell me you're gonna give me rest

856
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,800
 and then tell me that I'm gonna be yoked again.

857
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,640
 But you have to understand what Jesus is saying here.

858
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,560
 He's saying, "You've gotta understand

859
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,480
 "that when you're yoked to something,

860
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,080
 "it's gonna burn you out

861
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,160
 "unless the thing that you are yoked to is my yoke,

862
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,880
 "me, myself."

863
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,000
 If you don't know what a yoke is,

864
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,680
 a yoke was in the first century

865
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,400
 and is still used in farming rural communities today.

866
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,520
 It is a wooden beam that goes across two animals,

867
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,760
 usually two oxen.

868
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,000
 And the wooden beam goes across them like this.

869
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,280
 And there's like a little hoop here

870
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,120
 and a little hoop there.

871
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,080
 And the neck of the oxen's go through the hoop.

872
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,640
 And usually two oxen will be used to like plow a field

873
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,800
 or to carry a cart to market with the produce to market,

874
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,720
 whatever it might be.

875
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,200
 Now, interestingly, notice this,

876
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,960
 those yokes were made of wood.

877
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,280
 Guess who made the yokes in the first century?

878
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,480
 It was the carpenters.

879
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,080
 Should be making connections and dots there, guys.

880
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,280
 (audience laughing)

881
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,640
 Jesus did not make rocking chairs

882
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,320
 for grannies on the balcony, okay?

883
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,160
 Jesus made farming equipment.

884
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,280
 That's what a carpenter in Galilee

885
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,400
 and around that area in the first century,

886
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
 they made farming equipment.

887
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,920
 So no doubt, Jesus had made a bunch of these yokes

888
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,440
 over his career as a carpenter.

889
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,280
 So he says to the people who are farmers,

890
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,520
 he says, "It's like this yoke."

891
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,840
 Now, here's the interesting thing.

892
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,440
 Farmers would know this, but we don't

893
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,960
 because we live in modern Hong Kong.

894
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,760
 But in the first century, farmers understood

895
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,160
 that when you had a yoke, there were two animals

896
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,080
 that were yoked to it.

897
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,160
 There was one animal who was a big, strong ox,

898
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,040
 and then there was another ox who was slightly less strong.

899
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,200
 Now, the reason why a farmer would bring

900
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,880
 two animals like that together,

901
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,000
 a strong one and a slightly less strong,

902
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,760
 is 'cause the farmer is working for the long-term.

903
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,560
 And he wants to train up the slightly less strong oxen

904
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,840
 to one day go and be the strong oxen

905
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,440
 for another less strong oxen.

906
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,320
 If they took two strong oxen together all the time,

907
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,000
 there's no passing or learning on that process.

908
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,720
 So when you yoked animals,

909
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,480
 you took a strong one on the right side,

910
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,320
 a less strong one on the left side.

911
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,040
 The one on the right side had a noose in the yoke

912
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,240
 that was very tight,

913
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,720
 which meant that he would carry more of the weight.

914
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,680
 The one on the other side, the noose was looser,

915
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,840
 meaning that they didn't carry as much weight,

916
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,160
 but still carried some weight.

917
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,840
 And so Jesus is saying, "Take my yoke upon you."

918
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,040
 What he's saying is, "I'm on the right side

919
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,560
 "here, it's my yoke, you're sharing it with me.

920
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,680
 "It's tight around me because I can take on board

921
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,720
 "all of the weight.

922
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,360
 "You though, still have some weight to carry.

923
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,160
 "You still have a partnership here.

924
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,960
 "You're still a part of it, but don't worry.

925
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,520
 "I'm gonna carry the majority of your weight,

926
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,480
 "but there's still a weight that'll be upon you.

927
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,560
 "But don't freak out, I'm right alongside you.

928
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,680
 "We're doing this together.

929
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,440
 "It's a partnership towards what I wanna see

930
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,000
 "you flourishing in this world."

931
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,840
 That should remind you of Genesis 1 and 2,

932
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,440
 when God creates the world,

933
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,920
 he creates us in partnership with him

934
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,000
 so that we bring the world into flourishing.

935
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,080
 Then Jesus says to these people in Galilee,

936
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,600
 "Come to me, all you who are in burden,

937
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,560
 "and I will give you rest.

938
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,960
 "Here's how I will give you rest.

939
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,320
 "I will carry some of your load.

940
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,000
 "I will carry the heavy weight.

941
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,960
 "I will carry the majority of the stress.

942
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,000
 "I will stand beside you, walk alongside you.

943
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,360
 "I will fight battles for you that you didn't even know.

944
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,800
 "But you gotta recognise that we are

945
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,080
 "in partnership together.

946
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,360
 "There's still work to be done.

947
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,120
 "There's still joy ahead,

948
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,400
 "but you're gonna partner with me

949
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,760
 "and I'm gonna carry the heavy load.

950
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,400
 "You're gonna carry the light load,

951
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
 "but we are working in partnership together."

952
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,760
 This is why Jesus says, "Learn from me."

953
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,080
 He says, "Take my yoke and learn from me.

954
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,560
 "You're an apprentice with me.

955
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,520
 "You're the lighter oxen, if you will.

956
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,800
 "One day, you're gonna carry the heavier load.

957
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,080
 "One day, you're gonna grow to become

958
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,480
 "more and more like Christ Jesus,

959
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,760
 "attained to the whole measure

960
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,840
 "of the wholeness of Christ,

961
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,200
 "as it says in Ephesians 4."

962
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,400
 But he's saying, "Right now, be yoked to me.

963
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,560
 "I've got you.

964
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,360
 "I'm walking with you.

965
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,000
 "I'm beside you."

966
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,200
 Which is a truly liberating thought

967
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,960
 that we can be yoked to him

968
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,600
 and find ourselves in a place

969
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,360
 where that partnership is renewed,

970
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,640
 where sin put us in a place of striving.

971
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,240
 Jesus now puts us in a place again of thriving,

972
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,960
 not by the cessation of work,

973
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,480
 but by the re-understanding and the renewal of it.

974
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,080
 You see, before, when it was all about sin,

975
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,840
 our rest was hard for us.

976
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,400
 We wanted it physically.

977
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,360
 But what Jesus offers us is something far more profound,

978
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,240
 the rest within us, within our soul,

979
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,160
 that changes everything.

980
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,800
 This is biblical rest,

981
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,560
 not this kind of invitation to the cessation of work

982
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,840
 because we're exhausted from our striving,

983
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,320
 but the invitation to the renewal of work

984
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,280
 because we have eliminated our striving.

985
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,840
 Isn't that beautiful?

986
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,760
 Isn't that such a wonderful way

987
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,000
 to think about what Jesus is offering here?

988
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,840
 So when he says to them,

989
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,360
 "My yoke is easy and my burden is light."

990
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,120
 The word for easy there means to be well-fitted to you,

991
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,120
 well-structured just for you.

992
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,920
 He's like, "This is the way it was made for you."

993
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,960
 I want you to see something really important.

994
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,720
 What Jesus is essentially teaching is this.

995
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,880
 There is no such thing as a yokeless life.

996
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,640
 And I think that's so important.

997
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,880
 That's gonna revolutionize some of your thinking here.

998
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,560
 There is no such thing as a yokeless life,

999
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,680
 a life where you don't have any responsibilities,

1000
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,720
 a life where it is a permanent vacation,

1001
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,160
 a life where you're just chilling with Jesus all the time.

1002
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,280
 No, actually, you've been saved and redeemed and created

1003
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,120
 because God's got purpose for you.

1004
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
 The Sermon on the Mount, the Great Commission,

1005
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,800
 he wants you to roll up your sleeves.

1006
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,680
 There's a gospel to take to the world.

1007
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,920
 There's justice to be seen around us.

1008
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,600
 Now, if we try to do all those things in our own strength,

1009
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,520
 apart from Jesus, we will be striving and exhausted

1010
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,800
 and desperately need rest.

1011
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,520
 But when we do those, yoke to Jesus,

1012
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,640
 where he carries the heavier load,

1013
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,840
 we find ourselves fully becoming the people

1014
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,960
 we were created to be.

1015
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,720
 And God steps back and says, "That's not Sabbath,

1016
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,760
 that's Shalom.

1017
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,880
 Oh, come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,

1018
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,680
 because I haven't just got a Sabbath,

1019
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,560
 a one day where you can recover

1020
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,680
 as much as that's needed and Sabbath is good.

1021
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,040
 I've got Shalom, a eternity by which you're redefined."

1022
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,000
 There's no such thing as a yokeless life.

1023
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,520
 If you're in this room today, like I am,

1024
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,320
 and you're feeling exhausted, burnt out, tired,

1025
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,800
 overwhelmed, overstimulated,

1026
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,240
 desperately in need of a vacation,

1027
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,840
 you have to ask yourself,

1028
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,720
 what is it that you are yoke to?

1029
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,440
 Because you're not yoke to Jesus.

1030
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,920
 That's a strong word, but I'm just saying it straight up.

1031
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,640
 And this is the great question this passage asks us,

1032
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,200
 what is it that I am currently yoke to?

1033
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,960
 And you have to realize that sometimes you can be yoke

1034
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,760
 to what looks on the surface like good things,

1035
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,960
 but they're not Jesus.

1036
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,040
 And no matter even if you're yoke to good things,

1037
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,880
 if they're not Jesus,

1038
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,080
 you are only eventually gonna get exhausted

1039
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,640
 and weighed down once again.

1040
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,440
 Some of you in this room, you're yoke to the vine.

1041
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,680
 That's not good, we're not Jesus.

1042
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,600
 Some of you in this room, you're yoke to a relationship.

1043
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,000
 That's not good, that person is not Jesus.

1044
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 Some of you who are yoke to work, yoke to success,

1045
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,920
 yoke to making a name for yourself,

1046
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,520
 that's not good because that's not Jesus.

1047
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,320
 And it's not that we don't want you to love your church,

1048
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,760
 we want you to love your church.

1049
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,600
 It's not that we don't want you

1050
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,960
 to have great relationships in your life.

1051
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,960
 Of course we want you to.

1052
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,600
 It's not that you can't have a great job

1053
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,800
 and work hard and get promoted and earn a lot of money.

1054
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,920
 That's absolutely fine.

1055
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,760
 But when those things become the thing that you're yoke to,

1056
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,960
 you will live a life of exhaustion and burnout and tiredness

1057
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,680
 and you will not be working with Jesus

1058
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,840
 for the renewable things.

1059
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,280
 The only way we change the rat race,

1060
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,640
 the only way we get off the spinning wheel

1061
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,920
 is we recognize that Jesus says,

1062
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,200
 "Come to me, all you who are worried and burdened,

1063
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,040
 "and I will give you rest."

1064
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,840
 I'm the only one that can give you rest.

1065
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,280
 For my heart is gentle, my heart is humble,

1066
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,760
 and the rest that I give you

1067
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,600
 is not a pina colada on the beach in Bali,

1068
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,920
 it literally is a rest for your soul.

1069
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,160
 And when you receive that rest,

1070
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,720
 you don't wanna check out of the world,

1071
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,840
 you want to lean in.

1072
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,240
 My prayer for you is that that's where you will be.

1073
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,320
 And if you're anything like me

1074
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,440
 and you know what it is to be exhausted and burdened

1075
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,560
 and weary and stressed, you're in a great place

1076
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,840
 because you are qualified then for a relationship with Jesus.

1077
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,120
 The one thing that will truly give you rest, amen?

1078
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,280
 Would you stand with me?

1079
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,880
 And I would love to pray for us.

1080
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:16,600
 Father, we are just so grateful

1081
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,960
 for your presence here in this room.

1082
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,440
 Grateful for the fact that you are with us, close to us.

1083
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,280
 Grateful that for those of us who are weary and burdened,

1084
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,080
 the kind of rest that we really need is found in you.

1085
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,240
 I wonder if this is important for you here this morning,

1086
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,400
 if you're feeling this and if this is speaking to you,

1087
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,960
 if you know what it is to be weary and burdened

1088
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,480
 in this moment, I wonder whether you just open

1089
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,600
 your hands before you.

1090
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,180
 (gentle music)

1091
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:57,440
 The Holy Spirit would say a challenging thing to you

1092
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,480
 as your hands are open.

1093
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,400
 First of all, you would say, I love you, I've got you.

1094
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,800
 I can break the back of striving

1095
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,040
 and that weary and burden that you feel right now,

1096
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,360
 I can lift it off you in the name of Jesus.

1097
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,920
 I'm the strong oxen that is by your side,

1098
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,600
 carrying the heavy load.

1099
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,680
 Maybe the starting point for some of you here this morning

1100
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,140
 is just, Lord, would you come?

1101
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,360
 I can't take it anymore.

1102
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,960
 Just take a moment for some of you in this room,

1103
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,440
 watching online in the overflow,

1104
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,420
 Lord, I just, I can't take it anymore.

1105
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,740
 I'm exhausted, burnt out.

1106
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,900
 I'm codependent on relationships I shouldn't be.

1107
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,480
 I'm looking for salvation in all the wrong places.

1108
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,740
 I'm just tired 'cause of my boss.

1109
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,480
 Could be for many reasons, but you're standing here

1110
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,080
 and you're like, Lord, would you come?

1111
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,020
 I can't do this, I need you.

1112
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,060
 I need you to lift.

1113
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,900
 I need you to lift it off of me in Jesus' name, lift it off.

1114
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,260
 Father, I pray for my brothers and sisters here.

1115
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,260
 Lord, my heart goes out to each one.

1116
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,420
 Lord, would you lift off of their shoulders right now

1117
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,700
 in the name of Jesus?

1118
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,700
 The heaviness that striving has placed upon them.

1119
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:20,020
 The heaviness that sin has placed upon us.

1120
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,140
 The sin that we've chosen ourselves.

1121
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,640
 The sin that others have done that has impacted us.

1122
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,100
 Lord, would you liberate us?

1123
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,680
 Lord, we come to you.

1124
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,020
 And maybe for you, if this is resonating,

1125
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,660
 that's a prayer just to pray right now.

1126
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,460
 Lord, I come to you, I come to you.

1127
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,660
 I can't take it anymore.

1128
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,860
 I need you, I gotta have you step in

1129
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,960
 and take this from me.

1130
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:56,260
 And then the next thing I want you to do

1131
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,980
 as you're in this place of prayer

1132
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,340
 is just ask the Holy Spirit to show you

1133
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,460
 what it is that you're currently yoked to.

1134
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:10,620
 And you know that thing, it's gonna resonate in your spirit

1135
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,780
 as soon as the Lord shows it to you.

1136
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,620
 And you're gonna be like,

1137
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,820
 I have an unhealthy attachment to success,

1138
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,300
 an unhealthy attachment to this woman or this man,

1139
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,780
 an unhealthy attachment to this website,

1140
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,780
 an unhealthy attachment to whatever it might be

1141
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,980
 in your life.

1142
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,300
 And you know you're yoked to that thing.

1143
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,540
 And as long as you remain yoked to that thing,

1144
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,340
 you will feel the weight of it

1145
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,340
 'cause it is not designed to carry the weight like Jesus is.

1146
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,760
 (gentle music)

1147
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,300
 And as the Holy Spirit shows you

1148
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,940
 what it is that you are yoked to,

1149
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,780
 this is where we allow the ministry of the Spirit to come,

1150
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,740
 to liberate His people and His church

1151
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,680
 from the weary and the burdens that we carry,

1152
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,980
 to recognize that we're not given by Jesus

1153
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,180
 a responsibility-free life or a perfect life

1154
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,820
 that's never gonna be stressful,

1155
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,860
 but to realize that we are never gonna go

1156
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,020
 through that stress alone,

1157
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,860
 that if we are yoked to Him,

1158
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,400
 if our relationship is rooted in Him,

1159
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,660
 if we are finding Him as our greatest joy

1160
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,980
 and our greatest strength,

1161
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,700
 even when we go through the valley of the shadow of death,

1162
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,580
 it will not overcome us,

1163
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,740
 for He will be right there with us.

1164
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:29,780
 I wonder if we could just invite the prayer team to come.

1165
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,340
 And I wonder whether we could just do this right now.

1166
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,100
 You know, normally you do this at the end of the service,

1167
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,500
 but I just feel like the Holy Spirit

1168
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,700
 wants us to minister.

1169
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,340
 And I know that some of you may need to go in a moment.

1170
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,420
 We'll dismiss you in a moment,

1171
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,680
 but this is a ministry time.

1172
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,100
 This is where the Holy Spirit,

1173
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,520
 if this is speaking to you today,

1174
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,300
 don't leave here without the opportunity

1175
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,900
 to do some business with Jesus.

1176
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,340
 And so we have a prayer team already here at the front.

1177
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,420
 So I wanna invite you just to come and receive prayer.

1178
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,020
 If you know you need prayer today, don't wait.

1179
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,220
 Just come forward now and just come to our prayer team.

1180
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,220
 And we will stay as long as it takes

1181
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,980
 to pray for everybody that needs prayer.

1182
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,540
 We wanna lay our hands on you.

1183
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,220
 We wanna speak life over you.

1184
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,540
 We wanna release the burdens that you're carrying.

1185
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,140
 We wanna stand beside you.

1186
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,340
 We wanna reignite rest,

1187
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,340
 bring you back to the way

1188
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,300
 that you were originally created to be.

1189
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,900
 So come on church, I'm serious.

1190
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,580
 If you'd like prayer, come forward.

1191
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,340
 Come on.

1192
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,220
 That's right, just start coming forward.

1193
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,140
 We're gonna pray for you all.

1194
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,860
 You can just come and stand with one of our prayer team.

1195
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,260
 They're gonna pray with you.

1196
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,860
 Anyone else want prayer?

1197
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,340
 If we could have some extra people on the prayer team,

1198
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,860
 that would also be helpful.

1199
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,660
 Alana, would you mind praying for people?

1200
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,480
 Anyone else?

1201
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,400
 Come on.

1202
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,820
 In the upper house, you guys can come down as well.

1203
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,740
 If you're in the overflow,

1204
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,620
 you can come out and pray as well.

1205
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,520
 We wanna pray for every single person.

1206
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,140
 That's great.

1207
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,340
 Brilliant.

1208
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,300
 All right, we need more people to pray.

1209
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,660
 Is anybody willing to pray?

1210
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,140
 Somebody?

1211
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,400
 Sean, come on buddy.

1212
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,500
 Yeah, mate, thanks.

1213
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,540
 If you're willing to pray for people,

1214
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,820
 would you come forward as well?

1215
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,780
 If you're willing to pray for people,

1216
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,580
 just put your hand up as you come forward

1217
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,740
 and we're gonna make sure that everybody's,

1218
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,180
 you're willing to pray for someone?

1219
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,100
 You're willing to pray for someone?

1220
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,780
 All right, keep coming forward guys.

1221
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,820
 Sean, would you start praying?

1222
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,660
 Yeah, great.

1223
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,500
 You wanna pray?

1224
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,980
 Okay, you can pray for this guy.

1225
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,500
 Anyone else like prayer?

1226
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,580
 Thanks, Nathan.

1227
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,540
 If our elders are here,

1228
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,380
 anybody from our staff, prayer team.

1229
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:28,840
 And maybe if you're still here,

1230
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,940
 you can just stretch out your hands

1231
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,980
 or just begin to pray for yourself.

1232
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,700
 You can even pray for people around you.

1233
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,300
 We're just gonna take a moment to really do this together.

1234
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,300
 Okay, we need some more prayers.

1235
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,340
 Yeah, okay.

1236
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,180
 Can you come?

1237
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,580
 There's a lady just over here who's gonna pray for you.

1238
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,620
 Awesome.

1239
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:52,340
 Okay.

1240
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,780
 All right, there's a lot of people here in this line

1241
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,980
 that wanna get prayed for.

1242
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,980
 So we're gonna pray for them.

1243
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,660
 If you need to go, we wanna bless you to go.

1244
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,540
 But can I ask, just say something.

1245
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,780
 Can you just go as quietly as you can if you need to go?

1246
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,460
 I hope this has been helpful for you.

1247
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,100
 I'm sure the Lord also spoke to you.

1248
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,220
 So you can go into the week,

1249
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,420
 think about what it is to operate out of a place of rest.

1250
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,180
 Think about what it is that you've been yoked to.

1251
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,900
 The Lord is gonna continue to set you free.

1252
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,300
 If you wanna remain, remain.

1253
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,140
 We will pray for you.

1254
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,380
 If you wanna help pray for people,

1255
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,180
 please remain and pray for people.

1256
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,820
 We're gonna do this together, amen?

1257
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,660
 God bless everyone.

1258
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,620
 We'll see you guys next week.

1259
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,460
 Thank you.

1260
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,820
