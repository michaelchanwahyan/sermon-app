1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
 Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,600
 Good morning.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,960
 Happy New Year.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,720
 Here we are at the start of a new year.

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,720
 Thank you, Carla.

6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,720
 Beautiful.

7
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,720
 All right.

8
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,920
 It's good to be back.

9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,040
 My family and I, we've been away on sabbatical for a little while, and so it wasn't very

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,640
 restful when you're traveling with two little kids, but we had a lot of fun family time

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
 together.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,440
 But I'm so glad to be back with everybody and getting into the swing of things, Christmas,

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,360
 and of course, looking towards 2024.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,960
 We're going to be in Philippians chapter three today, so if you want to follow on the screen,

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,520
 it's going to come up on there, or if you have a Bible or a device that you can read

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,920
 from, I'm going to invite you to listen as I read Philippians chapter three, starting

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,480
 in verse seven.

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,760
 Word of the Lord says this, "But whatever were gains to me, I now consider loss for

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,920
 the sake of Christ.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,360
 What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,440
 Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,720
 I consider them garbage that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,480
 of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,040
 that comes from God on the basis of faith.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,840
 I want to know Christ, yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,600
 sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so somehow attaining to the resurrection

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,760
 from the dead.

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,240
 Not that I have already attained all of this, or already have arrived at my goal, but I

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:43,520
 press on to take hold of that which Christ Jesus took hold of me.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,160
 Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken a hold of it, but one thing

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:56,360
 I do, forgetting what is behind, straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:04,080
 goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus."

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,960
 So here we are, church, on the cusp of a new year.

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,200
 Goodbye 2023, hello 2024.

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,040
 For some of us, New Year's Eve is very exciting.

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,880
 Let me tell you how it's going to go down at my house tonight.

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,080
 After services today, I'm going to call Dobro's, I'm going to walk over to that little shop

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,360
 in Wan Chai, pick up my pizzas, we're going to go home and have pizza for dinner because

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,240
 it's super easy, put the kids to bed, I'm going to open a bottle of wine and then doom

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,440
 scroll Instagram for a little bit until I get a bit tired, then I'm going to put on

41
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,680
 a movie, I'll fall asleep on the sofa inevitably, wake up at 1am or the baby will wake me up,

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,200
 take a look at my watch, oh it's 2024 and go back to sleep.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,780
 I know how to party, that's how it's going to go down at my house.

44
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,960
 But for you, for you out there, maybe you have champagne in the fridge right now, I

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,360
 know Hudson does, definitely.

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,080
 Fancy dress party to attend later.

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,000
 Perhaps some of you in this room or watching online, you're planning to ask the big question

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,240
 tonight, okay?

49
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,520
 Some of you today are going to be ringing in 2024, okay?

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,240
 And it's all going to be good, it's going to be a celebration.

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,800
 Maybe that's you tonight, I don't know.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,600
 For some of us, 2023 has been a great year.

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,440
 You've hit your goals, you've landed that dream job, you've met the person that you've

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,880
 been wanting to meet.

55
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,320
 And as you look ahead, it's looking good.

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,040
 There is so much to look forward to.

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,400
 So tonight, as Prince tells us to do, we're going to party like it's 1999.

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,440
 However, dates like New Year's Eve are difficult for some of us.

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,160
 Because instead of looking forward to celebration and the excitement that's to come, tonight

60
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,380
 you're going to be reminded of how tough the past year has been.

61
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,820
 And as you look ahead, the forecast is just more disappointment.

62
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,800
 And 2023 hasn't been kind, and it's hard to see how things are going to change.

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,640
 And so Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, dates like this, it's just a painful reminder of

64
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,920
 pain and sadness.

65
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,640
 So as we look towards 2024, I'm not here to tell you today it's just going to be a best

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
 year ever, okay?

67
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,420
 I'm not going to say that because I have no idea, we have no idea how this year is going

68
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
 to turn out.

69
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,080
 Like I said, for some it's going to be awesome.

70
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,960
 All your hopes and dreams and prayers are going to come through.

71
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,760
 But for some it's going to be a storm.

72
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,920
 And I don't know if things are going to get better.

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,040
 But wherever we are in this journey, my hope for today, as we end this year, is going to

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,020
 be an encouragement and a challenge for everybody.

75
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,740
 And yes, I understand we don't have to wait till New Year's Eve to do something like this,

76
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,060
 but today is Sunday.

77
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,060
 We are gathered.

78
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,340
 It does happen to be New Year's Eve.

79
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,540
 So we have an opportunity to hear from the Lord about the things that have passed and

80
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,500
 the things that are yet to come.

81
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,060
 And what I do know is this, what I do know is no matter what life looks like for you

82
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,020
 right now, in this moment, in this season, there is an attitude, there's a frame of mind

83
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:31,420
 and a faith that Jesus wants us to step into as we look towards 2024.

84
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,020
 A foundation for us to build the next 365 days on.

85
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,580
 Some framework for you to think about as we step into the fast.

86
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,740
 And so whether or not 2024 brings you to the top of the mountains where you're celebrating

87
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:51,780
 or leaves you struggling in the valleys, we can be sure about our goals and our purposes

88
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,660
 for this year.

89
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,740
 So let's go back to the passage we're looking at today.

90
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,540
 Let's see what it has to say.

91
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:04,500
 Verse 7, "Wherever were gains to me, I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.

92
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,980
 What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing

93
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,460
 Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things.

94
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,380
 I consider them garbage that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having a righteousness

95
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,100
 of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness

96
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,220
 that comes from God on the basis of faith."

97
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,220
 So let me ask you this.

98
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,700
 If someone were to ask you, "How do you measure how successful your year has been?"

99
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
 What would you say?

100
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,140
 I'm preaching for this iPad and it messes up on me.

101
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,140
 Hang on a second.

102
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
 Normally I use paper.

103
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,140
 New year, new me.

104
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,940
 It's not working out so far.

105
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
 Hang on.

106
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
 Okay, here we go.

107
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
 Okay.

108
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
 What would you say?

109
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,380
 How would you measure how successful your year has been?

110
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,380
 What would be your answer?

111
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,820
 Well, if you're a fan of musical theater, you might say this.

112
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:07,020
 In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee, in inches, in miles, in laughter,

113
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,340
 and in strife, 525,000.

114
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:20,540
 Many times when we look at life, we measure it by achievements, things we have done.

115
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,460
 So as you look back towards 2023 and how successful it was, you might start by asking yourself

116
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,500
 the question, "Did I achieve all the things I set out to achieve?

117
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,660
 Did I hit all my goals?"

118
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,660
 Right?

119
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,740
 The internet, social media is going to be full of memes about this.

120
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,340
 You know the ones that say, right, "How it started, how it's going," right?

121
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,580
 And so as the year comes to an end, okay, not great for these guys, okay?

122
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,620
 You promise.

123
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,780
 As the year comes to an end, you might have been on this process yourself, seeing how

124
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,020
 well you've hit your 2023 goals.

125
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,300
 Now goals can be a good thing.

126
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,380
 In fact, here at the Vine, as a church, as a ministry, we have a process for setting

127
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,620
 goals for ourselves personally and professionally, right?

128
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,340
 We do this as a way to keep focus on the things that are important.

129
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,540
 It gives us a way to measure whether or not we're heading in the right direction, keeps

130
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,340
 us accountable to the things that we said we were going to do at the beginning of the

131
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,900
 year.

132
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,020
 And when we hit those goals, it's awesome, right?

133
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,120
 Setting that new personal best for a fitness goal and finally reaching that, that's great.

134
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,300
 Buying the dream car, getting that promotion, paying off that debt, whatever it is, when

135
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,660
 we reach our goals, there's an undeniable sense of achievement.

136
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,860
 It feels good.

137
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,740
 And so now as you look towards 2024, you might have already made a list of goals, resolutions

138
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,340
 to start the new year with.

139
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,980
 We make these declarations of the things we want to achieve at the beginning of a new

140
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,180
 year.

141
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,460
 And like I said, it can be a good thing.

142
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,700
 In fact, for some of us in this room and some of us watching online, you'd be doing yourself

143
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,740
 a great favor by setting some real goals this year so that the next 365 days don't just

144
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,180
 go aimlessly sailing by.

145
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,540
 At the same time though, if we make reaching these earthly goals the only thing, if hitting

146
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,620
 goals is a standard that we focus on, I don't think that's very healthy either.

147
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,980
 And I don't think that's the way Jesus calls us to live our lives.

148
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:36,020
 And by the way, statistics show us that only 9% of people who make resolutions manage to

149
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,980
 see them through till the end of the year, which means that for most of us this year,

150
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,820
 we've already failed before it started.

151
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,620
 Which is why when Paul says, "But whatever were gains to me, I now consider loss for

152
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,940
 the sake of Christ," it's absolutely ridiculous.

153
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,540
 Because this was a man who had hit all his goals.

154
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,980
 This was a man who achieved everything you could imagine to achieve and then some more.

155
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,800
 Listen to how he describes himself in Philippians chapter three a bit earlier, just the verses

156
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,300
 before this, 4 to 6.

157
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,780
 "If someone else thinks they have reason to put confidence in the flesh, I have more.

158
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,500
 Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew

159
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,900
 of Hebrews in regard to the law, a Pharisee.

160
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,260
 As for zeal, persecuting the church.

161
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,260
 As for righteousness based upon the law, faultless."

162
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,300
 In 2023 translation, this is what he's saying.

163
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,740
 "If you think you've done a lot with your life, trust me, it's nothing compared to what

164
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,900
 I've done.

165
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,660
 I'm the best of the best.

166
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,340
 I'm the creme de la creme.

167
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,340
 If you look at my resume, it's perfect.

168
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,820
 I'm the guy you aspire to be.

169
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:50,620
 I've done and achieved things you can only dream of doing yourself."

170
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,580
 But there's something important to note here.

171
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,500
 As much as he's achieved, what Paul is saying here, it's not the things that he achieved

172
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,220
 are of no value at all.

173
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,940
 He recognizes that these goals, these achievements he has are of great value.

174
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,440
 They are important.

175
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,800
 These things were precious to him, but yet he's still willing to throw it all away.

176
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,220
 In other words, what Paul is saying, Paul is not throwing away rubbish in order to gain

177
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,340
 Christ.

178
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:25,060
 He is throwing the things away that were extremely important to him in order to gain Christ.

179
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,180
 This is why his testimony is so remarkable.

180
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,420
 What Paul is saying that the best achievements he's gained in his life have become meaningless

181
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,580
 to him, that all the goals that he's reached are rubbish.

182
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,420
 Why?

183
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,980
 The answer is powerful but simple.

184
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,860
 He has a new goal, and that's Jesus.

185
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,660
 So in a world and a culture that puts so much focus on achievement, it seems like such a

186
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,540
 ridiculous thing to do, especially if you've achieved so much.

187
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,100
 But this is exactly the challenge that lies before us today.

188
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,860
 So let me ask us this, church, before or ahead of all the goals you want to see happen in

189
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:14,540
 2024, are we willing to put Jesus first?

190
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,780
 Paul's not talking about giving everything for the sake of nothing.

191
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,460
 There's a reason and a motivation.

192
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,060
 He hasn't gone crazy, although some might say he has lost his mind, but there's a motivation

193
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,140
 to do what he is doing.

194
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,420
 He is willing to give up everything because he has found something that's worth more than

195
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,380
 all these things put together.

196
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:41,220
 And Paul is giving up everything because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus,

197
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,220
 my Lord.

198
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:49,100
 Paul is giving up everything so he can walk in true righteousness.

199
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,940
 You see, he recognizes he had a righteousness once.

200
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,540
 He was perfect, he says, in following the law.

201
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,860
 But his righteousness wasn't one from God.

202
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,260
 It was one that was done by his own power.

203
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,460
 But now he recognizes there's a better righteousness, one that he could never achieve on his own,

204
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,380
 one that can only be given through life in Jesus.

205
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,340
 Paul is giving up everything so that he could have a life that is not defined by personal

206
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:24,140
 achievements, but is a life that is lived, defined through faith in Christ.

207
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:30,500
 He's choosing to give up even the best things so he could receive something better.

208
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:37,460
 At the risk of repeating myself, we have to understand Paul gave up everything, everything,

209
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,260
 his comfort, his reputation, the trajectory that was his, his money, his power, his identity,

210
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:50,180
 so that he could have a deeper and more intimate relationship with Jesus.

211
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,100
 And where do you think he got this example from?

212
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,300
 Because by the way, isn't this what Jesus did for us?

213
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,340
 Isn't this what we just celebrated at Christmas?

214
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,660
 Jesus who gave up his position in heaven, who made himself nothing, taking on the nature

215
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:15,100
 of a servant, humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross.

216
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,820
 Why?

217
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,340
 So then he could pave the way for us to have an intimate relationship with him.

218
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,700
 So let me ask this again.

219
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,020
 I'm going to phrase it more directly towards ourselves this morning.

220
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,900
 Are you willing to let go of all things, even your best things, even your most precious

221
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,260
 things in order to gain Jesus?

222
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,220
 Could this be the one goal you give yourself above all other goals?

223
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,340
 If the answer is yes, and I hope it is, we're going to talk about how to do this a little

224
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
 bit.

225
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,820
 Because after, like I said, after giving up our most precious things, we gain something.

226
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,380
 This passage gives us new goals to aim towards.

227
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:06,380
 Paul says this, "I want to know Christ, to know the power of his resurrection and participations

228
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:12,340
 in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so somehow attaining to the resurrection

229
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,480
 of the dead."

230
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,740
 So like I said, if you want some new goals for 2024, if you're looking for some framework

231
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,460
 to walk towards in your fast, this might be helpful for you right now.

232
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,820
 First thing is this, to know Christ.

233
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,540
 To know Christ.

234
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,780
 When Paul speaks of knowing Christ, this of course is more than just a general knowledge.

235
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,980
 It's more than just an intellectual awareness.

236
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,980
 But to know Christ is to be in relationship with him.

237
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,420
 Many of us in this room, we might know a lot about who Christ is.

238
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,140
 In fact, we might know a lot about a lot of people.

239
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,980
 I follow Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson on Instagram, right?

240
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,260
 And I know sometimes he posts what he's doing.

241
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
 I wouldn't say I know him.

242
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,020
 I mean, I know we have a similar physique, but apart from that, I don't know him that

243
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,020
 well, right?

244
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,300
 So I wouldn't say I was friends with him.

245
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,380
 So I'll say this again.

246
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,660
 To know Christ means we have to be in relationship with him.

247
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,140
 Not just being a part of a church, not just coming to Sunday services, attending Bible

248
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,140
 studies.

249
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:28,100
 The call here is not to know about Jesus, but to know him in a way that actually shapes

250
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,000
 and directs your life.

251
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,040
 My family in Christ.

252
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,820
 Do you truly know Jesus?

253
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:44,900
 Now, in order to truly know Jesus, you must also participate in this next step, to know

254
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:51,260
 this thing, to know the power of his resurrection.

255
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,580
 The most powerful display of God's love was shown to us when Jesus sacrificed himself

256
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,440
 on the cross.

257
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,140
 But the most powerful display of God's power was shown to us when Jesus was resurrected

258
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,960
 from the dead.

259
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,400
 And so if we truly want to walk in the life-changing relationship with Jesus in a way that actually

260
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,900
 shapes and directs our life, if we really want that, we have to understand that we do

261
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:25,980
 that by the power, the same power that raised Jesus from the dead lives in you.

262
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:32,180
 That's what empowers you to live a life-changing relationship with Jesus.

263
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,220
 But again, I think this is something we sometimes underestimate or forget about.

264
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
 We do.

265
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,220
 We underestimate what we can do in the name of Jesus.

266
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,780
 So we forget about this resurrection power.

267
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,500
 It makes us timid in our faith.

268
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,260
 We get scared.

269
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,940
 We start to think that there's certain things that God can't do.

270
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,340
 But let's not forget, church, with God, what things are possible?

271
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,660
 All things are possible.

272
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,460
 The biggest mountains of struggle in our lives that seem so insurmountable, God can move

273
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,740
 that mountain.

274
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,740
 All things.

275
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,280
 But here's the great mystery.

276
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,700
 At the same time, the power of resurrection in our lives also works in more subtle ways.

277
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,860
 Resurrection power might work in your way, in your life, like giving you encouragement

278
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,420
 in time of need.

279
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,820
 It might give you the courage to have that conversation with the person that you know

280
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,100
 is struggling in their faith.

281
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,620
 It might give you the wisdom and the patience to sit next to someone who's going through

282
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,060
 pain.

283
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,860
 It might give you a generous spirit to give away things, to help someone without anyone

284
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,100
 ever knowing a thing about it.

285
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,740
 It might not be as loud, but it's definitely as powerful.

286
00:18:52,740 --> 00:19:01,140
 So my question for us in this, do you want to know the power of resurrection in your

287
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,940
 life?

288
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,380
 Do you want to know Jesus, and do you want to know the power of his resurrection in your

289
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,260
 life?

290
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,560
 All this, of course, is gonna ask something for us.

291
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:22,340
 And it's going to require you to, and Paul says, participate in suffering.

292
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:27,680
 Now why would we want to participate in suffering?

293
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:34,020
 If we truly want to know Jesus and his power, then it's not just all about warm, fuzzy feelings,

294
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,700
 walking in his blessings, being encouraged, gathering community, as beautiful and as necessary

295
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,100
 as these things are.

296
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,640
 There is also, church, a call to suffer.

297
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,980
 To know Jesus fully means we must be able to relate what it means to suffer.

298
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:56,640
 Jesus himself says this, "Don't be surprised if people hate you.

299
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,760
 Take up your cross, then follow me."

300
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,400
 To the rich young ruler, he says, "If you want to follow me for real, sell everything,

301
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,620
 then you can come and follow me."

302
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,700
 Suffering is one of those Christian characteristics, one of those things of Christian life that

303
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,440
 we would like to conveniently ignore.

304
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,080
 But scripture tells us clearly we must be willing to embrace it.

305
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,160
 In other letters of Paul, in other books and parts of the Bible, it tells us that we have

306
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:33,720
 to go through things like endurance, refining, and perseverance, things that are not pleasant

307
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,980
 at the time when we go through them.

308
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:43,560
 They are painful, but is necessary for our righteousness.

309
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,100
 Now don't hear me wrong.

310
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
 I know, okay?

311
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,760
 We need to look after ourselves.

312
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,240
 Practicing self-care is an essential skill for our lives.

313
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,360
 I'm not calling us to look, search for suffering and just go through suffering for the sake

314
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,240
 of it.

315
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,360
 However, I do think there comes a point sometimes when self-care turns into selfishness or even

316
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,200
 self-indulgence, which means that every time something hard comes up, everything, you know,

317
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,320
 a tough road is up ahead, our natural inclination might be to avoid it.

318
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,400
 And we start to think, "Well, surely God's not calling me to step into this direction.

319
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,560
 That's gonna be hard.

320
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,940
 That's gonna cost me something.

321
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,940
 It's gonna be difficult."

322
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:35,480
 But church, let's not forget, we follow a Savior who was always willing to step right

323
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,620
 into the middle of suffering, who wasn't afraid of the storms.

324
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,960
 We follow a Savior who never shrunk back from doing the difficult thing.

325
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,640
 Therefore, as His followers, we need to learn how to embrace suffering as a way of getting

326
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,800
 to know Jesus better.

327
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,640
 We need to learn to be comfortable in navigating through the difficult things in life because

328
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,560
 the truth is the world around us is in a constant state of groaning.

329
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,080
 And the effects of sin in this world are still very much at play.

330
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,480
 Therefore, learning how to go through suffering means learning how to see Jesus in the midst

331
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,520
 of pain and inviting others to do the same.

332
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,520
 And the key to all of this, Paul tells us, it's becoming like Him in death.

333
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,800
 Again, it doesn't seem to make sense.

334
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,400
 If we want to gain something, we have to die.

335
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,720
 If we want to gain Jesus, we have to die.

336
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,640
 How does death lead to gain?

337
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,320
 Well think about it this way.

338
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,400
 What was Jesus' biggest achievement when He was here on this earth?

339
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,080
 What would you say that was?

340
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,120
 He did a lot of miracles, fed 5,000 people, walked on water, healed people, healed the

341
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,780
 sick, even resurrected the dead.

342
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:03,480
 But the biggest achievement, I might put to you, that Jesus achieved on this earth was

343
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,840
 in fact His death.

344
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,400
 Because Jesus dying was a shock to everyone.

345
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,200
 Nobody expected Jesus to die.

346
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,800
 Not even the enemy expected things would work out that way for Jesus on this earth.

347
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,780
 But He had to die.

348
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,400
 He had to die so that we could live.

349
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,320
 He had to die so that sin could be defeated.

350
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,920
 And so brothers and sisters, in the same way, in order for us to truly know Christ, we too

351
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,280
 have to die to the sins in our lives.

352
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,400
 To be in a true relationship with Jesus is to die to the things that hold us back from

353
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
 Him.

354
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,000
 Why is death so important?

355
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,440
 Because without death, there could never be resurrection.

356
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,780
 Without dying to the sin in your life, you will never be able to experience what a changed

357
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,140
 life looks like.

358
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,000
 You want to break free from the sins that were holding you back in 2023?

359
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,560
 The only solution is to die to them.

360
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,840
 And we do this by renouncing and repenting of our own selfish desires so that we can

361
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,560
 say yes to the path that Jesus wants us to walk down.

362
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,140
 And unless we do, we will never know freedom.

363
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,520
 You will never know what the new and resurrected life feels like.

364
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,980
 You will never know what it feels like to live life and life in the full as Jesus has

365
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,880
 promised us.

366
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,800
 We embrace these things.

367
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,880
 We embrace suffering.

368
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:39,120
 We embrace even death because we know that death does not have the final word.

369
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:46,160
 And resurrection is a reality, a promise that is to come for those who are in Christ.

370
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,520
 We can embrace death.

371
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,000
 We don't have to be afraid because death has been defeated.

372
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,840
 Now, if all that sounds challenging, it is.

373
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,120
 These things are challenging because these are things we'll never be able to obtain,

374
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,700
 to embrace, to fully grasp in our lifetime.

375
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,360
 You see, what we've been talking about is not just goals for 2024.

376
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,100
 These are goals for life.

377
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,440
 This is how Paul describes it.

378
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,480
 Not that I've already obtained all of this or have already arrived at my goal, but I

379
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,000
 press on to take hold of that which Christ Jesus took hold of me.

380
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,440
 Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it, but one thing

381
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,280
 I do, forgetting what is behind, straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the

382
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:45,340
 goal to win the prize which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.

383
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:52,480
 The journey to intimacy with Christ, the path of discipleship, a relationship with Jesus,

384
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,820
 the goal of knowing Him is going to be a lifelong pursuit.

385
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:03,000
 It's something that we have to be willing to walk in daily, which is why Paul tells

386
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,680
 us three times, "Press on, strain toward, press on, keep going."

387
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,080
 And in order for us to press on in this journey, we cannot let the things of the past hold

388
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,560
 us back.

389
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,880
 Forgetting what is behind, we strain towards what is ahead.

390
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,280
 This is why this is a message and a challenge, like I said, hopefully for everyone.

391
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,600
 Because if 2023 was the most amazing year for you, good for you, and what a blessing

392
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
 that was.

393
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,080
 And I don't mean that in a condescending way, really.

394
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,880
 But even so, even if 2023 was the most amazing thing for you, press on.

395
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,360
 Don't sit back and bask in the glory of the past, but be reminded that there is still

396
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,140
 so much more ahead, that God can do things that you haven't even seen or imagined.

397
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:02,560
 Be thankful for the things God has done, but keep looking forward to what is yet to come.

398
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:10,240
 And if 2023 was a tough season for you, the encouragement is the same.

399
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,460
 Press on.

400
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:19,880
 And I know the pain must have been real, and the loss you suffered was unimaginable, and

401
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:27,740
 it cut so deep, and you don't really even know how to take the next step forward.

402
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:38,220
 But know this, Christ Jesus has taken a hold of you, and He will never let you go.

403
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,960
 And I hope that you are walking in a community around you, a community that truly is able

404
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,300
 to walk with you through pain, so you are not alone in this.

405
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:55,220
 And as you look ahead, as fuzzy and dark as the future seems, as painful as you might

406
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:03,840
 anticipate it to be, be encouraged too, to know that there's a prize that awaits you.

407
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,600
 And in the great mystery of God's love and grace, I pray that you will find peace and

408
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,960
 healing in Jesus.

409
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,560
 So this is the challenge for us as we walk towards 2024.

410
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,240
 This is what God is calling us to, not just for this year, but for our lives as we continue

411
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,640
 on in this journey.

412
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,940
 So as we end, actually, I want to open up some space for God to speak to you, right?

413
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,340
 This is just a message from me.

414
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,040
 I'm just a person here speaking to you guys.

415
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,800
 I don't know what you've been through, but God does.

416
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,560
 And there's something that God wants to speak to every single person here tonight, here

417
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,680
 this morning, watching online, wherever we are.

418
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,720
 So we need to open up some space for God to be able to do that.

419
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,720
 I have no idea, but I do know that God wants to speak to you.

420
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,000
 So if you have something you can take notes with now, maybe it's on your phone or something

421
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,240
 that you write with, there's going to be some questions, reflections that we can use to

422
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
 guide our time in this.

423
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,680
 We're going to take some time actually right now to do this, but you can also take a picture

424
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,560
 if you want some more time throughout the rest of the day as we look toward 2024 to

425
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:29,300
 do this.

426
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:36,260
 And the team are going to play some music, but let's just open up our hearts right now

427
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:48,340
 and put distractions aside and ask God to speak to us.

428
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
 So Lord, here we are.

429
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,560
 Lord, we want to put aside some time right now.

430
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,260
 Every single person in this room is precious to you.

431
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:05,140
 Every single person in this room is a child of yours, whether they've realized it yet

432
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,940
 or not.

433
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,180
 And you are holding out your hand.

434
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:16,900
 That's the picture we got this morning, church, of Jesus holding out his hand, offering it

435
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,300
 to us.

436
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:28,420
 Father, I pray that you would give us the strength and the courage now to take you by

437
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,420
 the hand.

438
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:39,860
 Holy Spirit, I pray that you would come speak to us as we look ahead, as we strain towards

439
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,620
 the remaining time we have on this earth.

440
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,520
 Help us to put you first.

441
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:54,100
 Help us to know what a true and intimate relationship with you looks like.

442
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,740
 Help us to die to the things that have held us back from you.

443
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,220
 Walk with us through our suffering and help us to be a comfort to those around us as they

444
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,260
 are suffering.

445
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,940
 Speak to us in this time, Lord.

446
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:16,180
 We open up space for you to guide us and to lead us.

447
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:44,820
 Let's just spend some time in prayer on your own, church.

448
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,400
 (gentle music)

449
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,820
 (gentle music continues)

450
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,240
 (gentle music continues)

451
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,660
 (gentle music continues)

452
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,080
 (gentle music continues)

453
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,500
 (gentle music continues)

454
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,920
 (gentle music continues)

455
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,340
 (gentle music continues)

456
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,760
 (gentle music continues)

457
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,180
 (gentle music continues)

458
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,600
 (gentle music continues)

459
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,020
 (gentle music continues)

460
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,440
 (gentle music continues)

461
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,860
 (gentle music continues)

462
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,280
 (gentle music continues)

463
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:43,200
 (gentle music continues)

464
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,320
 (gentle music continues)

465
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,320
 (gentle music continues)

466
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,740
 (gentle music continues)

467
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:08,160
 (gentle music continues)

468
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:17,580
 (gentle music continues)

469
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,080
 (gentle music continues)

470
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:50,400
 Jesus, I thank you for speaking to us.

471
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,040
 I thank you that as we gather together as family, Lord,

472
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,460
 you are in our midst.

473
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:03,120
 The most amazing thing about you, Jesus,

474
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,400
 is that even as we leave,

475
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,560
 you continue to be with every single one of us

476
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,500
 and our families and the people we love

477
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,580
 and the things that we carry in our hearts.

478
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,800
 And so Lord, for the things of 2023,

479
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,460
 we leave them in your hands.

480
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,920
 And I pray comfort where comfort is needed.

481
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,080
 I pray strength where strength is needed.

482
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,420
 I pray thankfulness where thankfulness is needed.

483
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,760
 I pray hope where there's been hopelessness.

484
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,160
 And as we look ahead, Lord,

485
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,620
 as uncertain, as unknown as it might seem,

486
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:46,120
 I pray that you would give us the faith to know that

487
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,260
 if you are guiding us,

488
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,920
 even though if we go through difficult times,

489
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,260
 through difficult things, we are not abandoned.

490
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,460
 It may be part of your plan,

491
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:04,820
 but I pray that every decision we make,

492
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,260
 each and every day as Jethro was praying just now,

493
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,620
 as Justin's been praying,

494
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:14,960
 would be a decision to walk hand in hand with you,

495
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,380
 to get to know you better.

496
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,300
 (gentle music)

497
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,440
 So Jesus, thank you that you never give up on us.

498
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,640
 No matter what comes ahead, Lord, we trust you.

499
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,440
 We trust you fully.

500
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,140
 Lead us, guide us, protect us with your love.

501
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,880
 And we pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.

502
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,240
 Let's respond by worshiping Jesus together, church.

503
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,360
 You can stand or you can remain seated.

504
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,600
 And the worship team's gonna continue to lead us

505
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,860
 in some songs of worship.

506
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
