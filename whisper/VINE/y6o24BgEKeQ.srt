1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
 - Amen, hey church, it's such a privilege to be with you

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,200
 as it is every week and just to be a part

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,700
 of what God is doing amongst us.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,760
 And I just wanna echo Carla's words from earlier.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,240
 You know, it's been a really difficult week in Hong Kong.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,620
 It's impacted all of us in different ways.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,480
 And we're standing with you, we're praying for you.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,000
 We wanna walk together in this season and in this hour.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And I do hope that you know that amongst the brothers

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,460
 and sisters of faith, you have a community

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,560
 that's cheering you on, no one is alone, no one is isolated.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,560
 We're all part of one family together.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,600
 And that's the joy of being able to do this together.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,720
 To listen to God's word, to encourage each other

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,400
 and to see what God's gonna do amongst us.

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,720
 And I'm really excited about that today.

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,240
 I wanna tell you a little bit as I start

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,780
 about my experiences as a young Christian.

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,000
 You know, for a number of years

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,880
 when I first became a Christian,

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,040
 I was really skeptical about the more charismatic

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,040
 expressions of the Christian faith.

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,000
 In particular, I was very skeptical about speaking in tongues.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
 I actually came to faith

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,600
 when I was studying philosophy at university.

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,440
 And I was somebody who prided themselves

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,440
 on rational thinking.

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,320
 I saw the world actually through the lens,

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,960
 through the framework of rationality

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,640
 that actually debate and understanding

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,800
 and rational things were important and true.

32
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,320
 And that in order to really understand things,

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,520
 we needed to see the facts.

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,000
 We needed to understand things

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,040
 with our rational minds and brains.

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,400
 So therefore, as a younger person,

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,400
 I was pretty sceptical of emotional people,

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,320
 particularly sceptical of emotional people at church.

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,360
 I thought emotional people at church

40
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,320
 were just kind of going through the motions

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,480
 or just kind of being a bit strange.

42
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,360
 And that actually the only way that we truly come

43
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,880
 to understand the power of God is through our minds,

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,160
 through how we think.

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,200
 And that theology and rationality

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,580
 was the most important thing.

47
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,300
 This was actually a bit of a problem for me

48
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,920
 when I graduated university,

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,360
 came back to Hong Kong and joined the Vine.

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,200
 'Cause the Vine, as you know, is a charismatic church.

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,800
 But back in those days, I would say on Sundays,

52
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,960
 our charismatic expression was even more than it is today.

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,480
 It was quite regular back in those days

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,800
 that during worship,

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,680
 somebody might get slain in the spirit.

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,920
 That's falling down on the ground

57
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,720
 through the power of God's spirit.

58
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,800
 A lot of people would pray out loud

59
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,760
 or sing out loud in tongues.

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,300
 I remember this one particular week,

61
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,200
 and this is etched in my memory forever.

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,440
 This one particular week, this older lady in our church,

63
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,440
 she crowed like a rooster for five minutes during worship.

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,280
 Everybody else was completely uncomfortable

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,520
 with the reality that this lady, bless her,

66
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,040
 was crowing like a rooster.

67
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,180
 And so we had some pretty strange things taking place.

68
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,600
 And I have to say, I was very uncomfortable with it all.

69
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,760
 It didn't sit well with me.

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,320
 I believe that God didn't bring chaos into the church,

71
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,340
 that the church was a place of safety,

72
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,960
 of comfort, of security,

73
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,440
 that we came to church to feel like that.

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,560
 And that in those moments in worship,

75
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,680
 I wasn't comfortable for me.

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,920
 And I felt like God wouldn't be a part of something

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,280
 that was chaotic like it was.

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,260
 Well, there was this one particular Sunday

79
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,560
 where things were particularly frustrating and bad.

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,880
 On this particular Sunday, actually,

81
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,420
 I was standing right behind in the row,

82
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,720
 right behind of that old lady who had crowed like the rooster

83
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,920
 just a few weeks before.

84
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,800
 And I'm standing right behind her and worship is starting.

85
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,160
 And I can tell she's getting set to do something,

86
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,640
 some sort of animal noise

87
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,080
 I knew was gonna come out of this woman.

88
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,240
 She started to shake back and forth.

89
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,760
 She started to kind of do this.

90
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,400
 And I was just preparing myself

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,800
 for the eruption that was to come.

92
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,560
 And I was kind of frustrated by it all,

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,400
 if I'm honest with you.

94
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,000
 So I just sort of decided I was gonna close my eyes

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,880
 and just try to block everything else out

96
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,160
 and just try to connect with God.

97
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,740
 So as I closed my eyes,

98
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,040
 I received what I can only describe to you as a vision.

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,380
 It was a vision because even though my eyes were closed,

100
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,460
 I could see with 100% clarity a picture.

101
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,760
 And in this picture, it was like a movie.

102
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,320
 And it was like I was suddenly in this movie set.

103
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,380
 And the set was like this dusty street

104
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,940
 with lots of little narrow alleyways

105
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,260
 and lots of homes side by side,

106
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,260
 small white houses with flat roofs.

107
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,420
 And I could see these things just very clearly.

108
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,180
 And I could almost walk amongst those streets.

109
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,980
 And actually the houses reminded me

110
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,420
 of the kind of houses that I was seeing

111
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,080
 in the little pencil drawings

112
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
 that were found in my Bible in those days.

113
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,820
 I knew that this was Israel,

114
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,500
 that I was seeing some street,

115
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,660
 perhaps in the old city of Jerusalem.

116
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,260
 And as I'm looking at this,

117
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,740
 I noticed that on every doorframe of every building,

118
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,340
 there is Hebrew words,

119
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,500
 Hebrew script written over them.

120
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,740
 Now, this was years before I went to Bible school.

121
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,100
 And as I looked at the doorframes,

122
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,220
 I could see the Hebrew and immediately I could read it

123
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,580
 just as if it was English.

124
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,300
 I knew exactly what it was saying.

125
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,580
 The words over every house was this,

126
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,180
 it's time to come home again.

127
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,320
 It's time to come home again,

128
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,260
 written over every single doorframe of every single home.

129
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,180
 And I could read it just like I say,

130
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,260
 just like it was English,

131
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,420
 like it was my own language.

132
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,580
 And as I'm reading the Hebrew,

133
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,340
 knowing exactly what it means, not only that,

134
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,380
 but also knowing how to pronounce the word,

135
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,420
 if I was gonna say it.

136
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,860
 This all happened like just immediately.

137
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,820
 I also found in me the Spirit of God

138
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,700
 just working towards me a place of peace and shalom,

139
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,580
 like this place of being right where I needed to be

140
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,740
 with God in that moment.

141
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,300
 And I knew that the words over those homes

142
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,080
 was for that old lady standing in front of me.

143
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,060
 So I, without really perhaps even thinking about it,

144
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,060
 I leaned forward, I put my hands on her shoulders

145
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,660
 and I start to get this,

146
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,340
 I start to sing those Hebrew words over her

147
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,540
 in Hebrew, not in English, okay?

148
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,220
 I start to sing Hebrew.

149
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,860
 Now that's amazing for two things.

150
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,300
 Number one, I don't speak Hebrew, let alone sing it.

151
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,180
 But number two, if you know me,

152
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,560
 if you know me, you know that I don't sing,

153
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,060
 that I do not have a good singing voice.

154
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,980
 So I'm there singing my heart out in Hebrew,

155
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,580
 a language that up into that moment,

156
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,020
 I did not know, didn't understand,

157
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,740
 but knew exactly what I was singing over her

158
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,940
 in the perfect pronunciation.

159
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,380
 She starts weeping, like deep weeping,

160
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,100
 like just weeping and weeping and weeping.

161
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,340
 And I keep singing and singing those words.

162
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,960
 It's time to come home again.

163
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,440
 It's time to come home again in Hebrew over her.

164
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,080
 Well, a couple of days later, she reached out to me

165
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,440
 and she let me know what was going on.

166
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,760
 She had visited Israel many, many times in her life,

167
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,320
 but she had stopped going for a bunch of different reasons.

168
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,720
 And she didn't feel like she wanted to go there anymore,

169
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,880
 but she really deeply missed being amongst the Jewish people,

170
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,840
 even though she herself was not Jewish.

171
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,200
 And as I was singing over her in that church service,

172
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,120
 she knew that God was saying those exact words to her.

173
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,640
 She understood Hebrew.

174
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,680
 She knew what I was singing over her

175
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,820
 was it's time to come home again.

176
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,760
 Here's an interesting thing.

177
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,320
 There's me, sceptical,

178
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,000
 totally driven by rationality in those days,

179
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,280
 kind of feeling awkward

180
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,880
 when the Holy Spirit would move upon people.

181
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,880
 And God gives me a vision and I step out in faith

182
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,080
 and everything in me changes.

183
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,320
 From that moment onwards,

184
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,960
 I've had a really interesting relationship

185
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,840
 with the Holy Spirit.

186
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,960
 Things have shifted and changed in me.

187
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,800
 And while I haven't had visions like that very often

188
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,280
 throughout my Christian life,

189
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,960
 that moment was a changing moment.

190
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,420
 It was like the breaking down of a barrier

191
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,520
 that I had put in my mind

192
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,160
 to what the Holy Spirit actually wanted to do.

193
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,080
 And I realised that so often my customs, my traditions,

194
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,480
 the things that I am comfortable with

195
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,400
 can become a barrier to the thing

196
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,560
 that the Holy Spirit might actually want to do.

197
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
 As we enter into this final week

198
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,200
 of our Dreaming Again series,

199
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
 I wanna speak a word today

200
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,760
 that I believe is important for all of us.

201
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,880
 I think there's a need for all of us

202
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,840
 to receive a fresh revelation from God.

203
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,920
 The kind of fresh revelation

204
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,880
 that actually shakes and disrupts and breaks down

205
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,360
 some of those unhealthy barriers,

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,560
 unhealthy customs and traditions

207
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,520
 that we can sometimes hold onto

208
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,520
 even above what God might wanna do amongst us.

209
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,560
 Now, don't get me wrong.

210
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,480
 Having some customs, having traditions is fine.

211
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,400
 Okay, here at the Vine, we have a theology,

212
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,080
 a framework of theology, a statement of beliefs.

213
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,320
 You can find it on our website that we believe passionately.

214
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,040
 But here's the reality that I've come to see

215
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,520
 in my Christian life and experience.

216
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,280
 And perhaps you've seen this too,

217
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,800
 is that so often we can embed ourselves,

218
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,520
 so often we can embed ourselves

219
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,960
 in the kind of thinking about our church practices,

220
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,920
 our customs and traditions that we feel comfortable with,

221
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,520
 that those things actually begin to define

222
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,120
 how we think about God.

223
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,760
 And so actually it is our customs and traditions

224
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,200
 and practices that become to shape our theology.

225
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,360
 And when that happens, we're in danger, I think,

226
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,360
 of putting our personal preferences over God's truth.

227
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,040
 And when that takes place,

228
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,040
 I think God so often must step in with a fresh revelation

229
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,240
 because it will take, like it did for me on that day,

230
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,360
 a profound move of the Holy Spirit to shake us out

231
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,520
 of some of the entrenched thinking that we can find

232
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,760
 through our personal preferences,

233
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,920
 our comforts and our securities.

234
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,760
 You see, it's interesting

235
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,480
 because Jesus understood this deeply

236
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,680
 when he began his own ministry here on earth.

237
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,360
 He knew that he was bringing a message

238
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
 of the kingdom of God,

239
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,880
 a message that was gonna come and shake things up.

240
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,160
 He also understood that that message

241
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,700
 was not gonna be very easily received

242
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,360
 by those that were entrenched

243
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,360
 in Judaic thinking at the time.

244
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,800
 In fact, right at the start of his ministry,

245
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,720
 Mark records for us a teaching Jesus brings the crowds.

246
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
 I wanna read this to you from Mark chapter two,

247
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,720
 starting in verse 22.

248
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,720
 He says this, "No one pours new wine into old wineskins.

249
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,320
 If he does, the wine will burst the skins

250
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,920
 and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined.

251
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,320
 No, he pours new wine into new wineskins."

252
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,360
 I think so often the reality is this,

253
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,880
 that when it comes to our idea of dreaming,

254
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
 God gives us these dreams and they're amazing.

255
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,920
 And it's like this new wine is being poured into us.

256
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,960
 But here's the reality.

257
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,800
 So often we take the new wine of God

258
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,080
 and we try to fit it into the old wineskins

259
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,200
 of our traditions and customs.

260
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,560
 When actually what we need is a new wineskin

261
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,320
 that is able to retain the new wine that God is giving us.

262
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,720
 See, the reality is this,

263
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,040
 sometimes to move forward in our dreams

264
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,360
 that God has given us will require

265
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,880
 a new fresh way of thinking,

266
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,960
 a fresh way of believing that is only possible in us

267
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,000
 through a profound movement of the Spirit of God.

268
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,720
 That's what we need sometimes,

269
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,360
 to shake us out of how we always have thought,

270
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,920
 how we always have tried to put God into a little box

271
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
 when God actually wants to break forward.

272
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,800
 We put that little metal gate in front of the fire

273
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,440
 so we protect ourselves

274
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
 'cause we're happy with the God that we know

275
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,840
 rather than the God that actually wants to show up.

276
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,120
 The one who might actually want to shake us up.

277
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,480
 The one that we actually need to come to set us on fire.

278
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,920
 Again, I feel like for some of you watching this,

279
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,600
 this is gonna be a word for you in season.

280
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,840
 And here's the reason.

281
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,000
 It's because God has given you new dreams.

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,320
 He has, if you will, poured out his new wine,

283
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,560
 but you've been frustrated

284
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,920
 because you've been trying to fit that new wine

285
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,280
 into the old wineskin

286
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,960
 of what you're comfortable with in your life right now.

287
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,680
 And while this might not be always easy to hear

288
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,380
 when God brings his new wine,

289
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,480
 it's 'cause he wants to put it in a new wineskin.

290
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,560
 That means some things might need to change.

291
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,960
 That means we might need to be open to fresh revelation,

292
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,160
 fresh way of thinking, fresh way of understanding,

293
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,600
 fresh way of actually practising our belief and our faith.

294
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,120
 Perhaps even, dare I say, fresh theology,

295
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,120
 fresh ways of truly understanding who God is amongst us.

296
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,260
 I wanna challenge us with this idea

297
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,840
 of what it is to embrace fresh revelation today

298
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,600
 by taking us to a passage from the early church.

299
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,400
 It's a passage actually where the early church

300
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,040
 has this dramatic encounter with God

301
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,860
 that procures and creates a new wineskin in the church.

302
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,080
 That is the very reason why,

303
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,440
 if you're watching this right now and you're a believer,

304
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
 that you've become a Christian.

305
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,480
 It's because of what God does in this particular story

306
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,740
 I wanna take you to.

307
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,560
 It's from Acts chapter 10,

308
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,680
 and I'm gonna start reading in verse one.

309
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,840
 I hope you're with me.

310
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,040
 I hope you're awake.

311
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,600
 I believe honestly that God's got some fresh revelation

312
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,680
 for you today.

313
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,800
 And I wanna pray actually just before I open the Word.

314
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,720
 I wasn't planning to do this,

315
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,040
 but I feel like this is important just to break off

316
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,360
 any distraction that there might be out there.

317
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,240
 Let me pray for this.

318
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,580
 Father, as we open your Word, we do so with hunger.

319
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,180
 We do so Lord willing to shake off our traditions,

320
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,840
 to shake off even our religion,

321
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,160
 if it means that we've missed you along the way.

322
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,180
 And Father, we wanna ask for a fresh revelation, Lord,

323
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,180
 of your power, of your spirit, of your love, of your Word.

324
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,040
 And I pray you would do this amongst us

325
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,720
 in such a beautiful way today.

326
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,820
 Let me pray this in Jesus' name.

327
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,660
 Everyone says.

328
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,600
 - Amen. - Amen.

329
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,000
 All right, I wanna read to you from Acts chapter 10,

330
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,600
 starting in verse one.

331
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,520
 At Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius,

332
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,120
 a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.

333
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,360
 He and all his family were devout and God-fearing.

334
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,920
 He gave generously to those in need

335
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,480
 and prayed to God regularly.

336
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,840
 One day at about three in the afternoon, he had a vision.

337
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,120
 He distinctly saw an angel of God

338
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,720
 who came to him and said, "Cornelius."

339
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,660
 Cornelius stared at him in fear.

340
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,840
 "What is it, Lord?" he said.

341
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,400
 The angel answered, "Your prayers

342
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,680
 and the gifts of the poor

343
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,760
 have come as a memorial offering before God.

344
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,280
 Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon,

345
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,920
 who is called Peter.

346
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,800
 He is staying with Simon the Tanner,

347
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,760
 whose house is by the sea."

348
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,880
 When the angel who spoke to him had gone,

349
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,600
 Cornelius called two of his servants

350
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,240
 and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.

351
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,800
 He told them everything that had happened

352
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,640
 and he sent them to Joppa.

353
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,580
 Luke starts the story by introducing us

354
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,120
 to this main character in the story, Cornelius.

355
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,360
 He tells us three quick things.

356
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,840
 He's a Gentile, he's a centurion.

357
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,120
 In other words, he's a Roman soldier

358
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,720
 that has a hundred soldiers under his command.

359
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,840
 And most importantly, he says he's devout and God-fearing.

360
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,480
 This was somewhat common in the times

361
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,640
 that Gentiles might have become aligned

362
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,000
 to the Jewish way of thinking,

363
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,680
 and even perhaps aligned to the worship of the Jewish God.

364
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,440
 A God-fearer was a Gentile

365
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,740
 who took on the beliefs of the Jewish faith.

366
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,640
 Not perhaps in every way in their life,

367
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,640
 but perhaps in an openness, as we hear in this story,

368
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,440
 to give money to the poor

369
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,360
 or to pray to this God from time to time.

370
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,000
 And here we have a picture of Cornelius

371
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,720
 praying to the Jewish God,

372
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,440
 and God shows up and gives him a new dream.

373
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,280
 He actually says to him,

374
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,560
 "Okay, I want you to go to Joppa.

375
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,440
 I want you to get this apostle, Peter, who's a Jew.

376
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,440
 I want you to invite this Jewish man to come into your home."

377
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,280
 Now on paper, that doesn't seem like a big deal to you and I,

378
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,600
 but in the first century, that's completely revolutionary.

379
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,040
 We need to understand two quick things in context here.

380
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,360
 The first is this, that actually it was illegal.

381
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,240
 It wasn't right in Jewish thinking for a Jewish person

382
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,720
 to go into the home and share a meal

383
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,640
 with a Gentile in those days.

384
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,600
 That was outlawed in the rabbinic law.

385
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,480
 It's really important that you know

386
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,800
 that there were two types of law.

387
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,480
 There was rabbinic law and Torah law.

388
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,120
 Torah law was the law that was found

389
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,800
 in the first five books of the Bible,

390
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,440
 the law that came from God's word himself.

391
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,760
 But there was also rabbinical law.

392
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,000
 Rabbinical law was the law that had grown up

393
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,240
 through the rabbis over the years

394
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
 as they sought to interpret God's word.

395
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,800
 And rabbinical law, not Torah law,

396
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,160
 had outruled the idea that a Jewish person

397
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,520
 could go into a Gentile's home for a meal.

398
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,040
 Now here's the reason why.

399
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,160
 It's because in Jewish thinking,

400
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,920
 there was things that were seen as both unclean and impure.

401
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,800
 Unclean and impure.

402
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,000
 An unclean thing was a Gentile,

403
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,320
 the Gentiles by their very existence,

404
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,440
 being foreign, being ethnically other from the Jewish people,

405
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,640
 not under that Jewish covenant,

406
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,540
 not part of the chosen generation.

407
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,600
 They were seen as unclean in God's eyes.

408
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,940
 And if a Jewish person associated

409
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,880
 with someone who is unclean,

410
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,040
 while the Jewish person could not become unclean themselves

411
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,640
 'cause they're under the new covenant,

412
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,960
 they could become impure,

413
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,080
 tainted by the unclean person that they were with.

414
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,940
 Think about this in COVID terms.

415
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,680
 This is like a Jewish person becomes a close contact

416
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,880
 with a Gentile, they have to go in quarantine

417
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,400
 before they're allowed to be released

418
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,880
 back into the Jewish community.

419
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,020
 You following with me?

420
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,840
 That was what was happening here.

421
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
 So when God says to Cornelius,

422
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,480
 "Invite this Jewish man to your house,"

423
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,200
 he's thinking to himself, "Hang on a sec.

424
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,800
 God is asking me to do something

425
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,440
 that's against the rabbinical law.

426
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,160
 And if I invite this Peter over and he comes,

427
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,240
 he'll become impure."

428
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,640
 Like this doesn't make any sense.

429
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,600
 This is God bringing fresh revelation

430
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,560
 to disrupt the rabbinical law,

431
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,860
 the customs and traditions that had gotten in the way

432
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,680
 of what he wanted to do.

433
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,420
 Cornelius as a God-fearing devout man says,

434
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,680
 "All right, Lord, if this is what you're doing,

435
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,280
 if this is what you're gonna say, I will trust you.

436
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,760
 I'll go out and I'll invite this Peter to come."

437
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,480
 Let's see what happens next.

438
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,880
 Verse nine, "About noon the following day,

439
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,940
 as they were on their journey and approaching the city,

440
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,760
 Peter went up onto the roof to pray.

441
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,240
 He became hungry and wanted something to eat.

442
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,680
 And while the meal was being prepared,

443
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,200
 he fell into a trance, a vision, if you will, a dream.

444
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
 He saw heaven open and something like a large sheet

445
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,760
 containing was being let down to earth on its four corners.

446
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,480
 It contained all kinds of four-footed animals,

447
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,360
 as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.

448
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,960
 Then a voice told him this, 'Get up, Peter, kill and eat.'

449
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,040
 'Surely not, Lord,' Peter replied.

450
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,380
 I have never eaten anything," notice this,

451
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,680
 "that is impure or unclean."

452
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,060
 The voice spoke to him a second time,

453
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,060
 "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."

454
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,640
 This happened three times.

455
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,640
 And immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.

456
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,060
 Just like for Cornelius, now for Peter.

457
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,740
 Peter receives a similar vision.

458
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,780
 He's up praying and a vision comes.

459
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,480
 And in that vision, the sheet's let down.

460
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
 And it's really important, it says here

461
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 that he saw all kinds of four-footed animals together.

462
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,320
 Now this is really important because Peter's hungry

463
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,080
 and he sees all these animals in front of him in this dream.

464
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,680
 And he sees, notice, four-footed animals all together.

465
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,280
 Now in Jewish dietary laws,

466
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,320
 there were animals that were deemed clean and unclean.

467
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,240
 Clean to eat and unclean not to eat.

468
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,960
 Unclean animals were things like pigs and horses.

469
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,640
 Clean animals were things like cows and chickens.

470
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,340
 You can eat those, but you can't eat what's unclean.

471
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,520
 However, if the clean animals,

472
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,100
 like the cows and the chickens,

473
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,860
 come into close proximity with the unclean pigs and such,

474
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,520
 then they became impure and also could not be eaten,

475
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,840
 even though they were deemed clean to begin with.

476
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,980
 Are you following with me?

477
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,800
 All right, so what that means is this.

478
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,740
 When Peter's seeing all these animals on this sheet,

479
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,940
 even though some are theoretically clean,

480
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,200
 because they're mingling with those that are unclean,

481
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,420
 they've become impure and he can't eat any of them.

482
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,680
 He's hungry, staring at all these things,

483
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,480
 and he's realising he's not allowed

484
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,940
 to eat any of them at all.

485
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,840
 So when God says, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat,"

486
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,100
 he is totally taken back.

487
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,820
 This goes against everything he understands

488
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,400
 about the law of God.

489
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,580
 This goes against everything he would understand

490
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,360
 that God would ever tell him to do.

491
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,760
 He can't get his head around the idea

492
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,020
 that God would want him to go and kill and eat something

493
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,160
 that either is unclean or is impure,

494
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,200
 which is why he says to God, "Surely not, Lord.

495
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,040
 I have never eaten anything that is unclean or impure."

496
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,880
 I love this.

497
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,360
 He says, "Surely not, Lord."

498
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,560
 In other words, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Lord.

499
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,760
 You can't be asking me to do that.

500
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,380
 You can't, because that's not of you.

501
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,000
 That's surely not of your character.

502
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,100
 That's not the box that I've got you in.

503
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,780
 That doesn't fit right.

504
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,580
 I don't want that.

505
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,320
 Surely not, Lord.

506
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,600
 I think the reality is this.

507
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,600
 All of us have a tendency to say, "Surely not, Lord."

508
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,180
 When God so often moves in a fresh revelation,

509
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,780
 when he brings a word to us,

510
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,340
 it's so perhaps different from what we thought

511
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,900
 our initial reaction surely is, "Surely not, Lord."

512
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,120
 Particularly when those things

513
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,320
 go against our personal preferences,

514
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,280
 the things that we've made,

515
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,780
 our customs and our traditions and the ways.

516
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,860
 See, here's the reality.

517
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,140
 There is a comfort, isn't there,

518
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,420
 to our customs and traditions.

519
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,620
 We like a no surprises kind of God,

520
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,700
 one who is stable and understandable,

521
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,380
 one who is relational, who is reasonable, predictable.

522
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,260
 That's the kind of God that we like.

523
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,740
 We like a religion that's nicely tied up

524
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,980
 with a sweet little bow

525
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,940
 that helps us to understand everything.

526
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,020
 We like to have answers, don't we?

527
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,940
 We don't like uncertainty.

528
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,480
 We like certainty.

529
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,420
 I've noticed that as I've gotten older in life,

530
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,380
 I want stability and certainty more than ever before.

531
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,860
 I know that I can find myself

532
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,820
 rooted in my personal preferences

533
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,820
 as I get older more and more.

534
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,140
 And the reality is this,

535
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,940
 that so often when we are entrenched

536
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,140
 in those customs and traditions,

537
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,940
 when we're seeking a God that we fully understand,

538
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,060
 where we try to get out mystery,

539
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,680
 where we try to get away doubt,

540
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,580
 when we try to run away from the things

541
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,340
 that might confuse us about God

542
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,980
 and try to put God in a little box

543
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,500
 that we can tie with a bow and fully understand,

544
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,380
 when that happens, here's the reality,

545
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,380
 so often we find ourselves acting more from a place of law

546
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,020
 than a place of grace.

547
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,300
 You need to follow with this, church,

548
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,340
 'cause this is really important.

549
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,180
 So often we find ourselves in a place of law

550
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,620
 more than a place of grace

551
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,420
 because law is comfortable.

552
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,380
 Law creates boundaries.

553
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,100
 Law gives us safety and security.

554
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,260
 Grace is risky.

555
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,900
 Grace shunts us out of the things that are comfortable

556
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,060
 and puts us in a place of higher risk,

557
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,700
 of unpredictability, of at times uncertainty.

558
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,280
 And we need to realize that so often

559
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,220
 we find ourselves like that.

560
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,680
 And here's the reality,

561
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,680
 so often those of us who are comfortable in man's laws

562
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,880
 are really uncomfortable in God's grace.

563
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,080
 I'm gonna say that again, church,

564
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,480
 'cause I think that's super important right now.

565
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,200
 So often those of us who are comfortable with man's laws

566
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,960
 really struggle with God's grace.

567
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,360
 We struggle because God's grace

568
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,720
 turns some of those things outside of what we're expecting,

569
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,960
 rips open our customs and our beliefs,

570
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,400
 rips open the things that we have created

571
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,120
 to help us to feel comfortable and safe and secure.

572
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,120
 God's grace is risky by its very definition.

573
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,920
 We're like the elder son

574
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,000
 in the parable of the prodigal son

575
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,600
 who can't understand that our father would reach out

576
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,640
 and bless that person.

577
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,600
 Oh God, I don't understand why you would bless,

578
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,160
 haven't you seen their lifestyle?

579
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
 Haven't you seen how they live?

580
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,240
 Haven't you seen the mistakes they've made?

581
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,160
 Haven't you seen the way they're treating their spouse?

582
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,400
 Haven't you seen all of this stuff

583
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
 that's going on in their lives?

584
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,240
 How could you bless them

585
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,840
 in the same way that you're blessed to be?

586
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,120
 Surely not, Lord.

587
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,440
 When we find ourselves entrenched this way,

588
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,800
 we really struggle with the reality

589
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,440
 that God's grace is here.

590
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,560
 And I want you to know this,

591
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,160
 so often Christians are so judgmental towards one another.

592
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,680
 We are some of the worst when it comes

593
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,120
 to judging one another,

594
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,360
 to judging our faith based on our actions,

595
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,980
 judging our churches based on their expressions,

596
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,720
 judging theology based on denominations,

597
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,600
 judging who we think should be in

598
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,480
 and who we think should be out.

599
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,880
 And this is something that God wants to disrupt in us

600
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,000
 in this time, I believe.

601
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,640
 He wants unity across the brokenness more than ever before.

602
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,080
 And that will take some fresh revelation for us.

603
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,040
 'Cause the sad truth is this,

604
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,240
 that so many Christians who have been saved through grace

605
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,840
 end up becoming judgmental through the law.

606
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,900
 So often that takes place for us.

607
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,740
 So often that happens.

608
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,380
 And we need to be shaken where some of our customs

609
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,820
 and traditions have put our personal preferences

610
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,460
 over God's truth and His word.

611
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,380
 And this is not just for the church.

612
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,700
 This is for our city, for our society as well.

613
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,820
 You know, we cry out,

614
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,620
 surely not, Lord, in society often all the times.

615
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,140
 And we put barriers up between those

616
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,540
 that we think are worth it

617
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,580
 and those that we don't think are worth it.

618
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,160
 And we can see things like racism and in classism

619
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,680
 and kind of tribalism at work and around us all the time.

620
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,880
 And we can see even our city and our society say things like,

621
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,760
 well, that person's not quite as valuable as that person.

622
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,400
 And our laws and the way we treat one another

623
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,760
 and the way that things happen

624
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,880
 can actually put ethnic groups amongst each other,

625
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,200
 can actually put ethnic minorities

626
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,160
 against those that might be in a majority.

627
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,660
 And that some get privileged and some don't.

628
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,220
 And we're aware that this happens

629
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,080
 even here in our beloved city of Hong Kong.

630
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,920
 I think we're honest,

631
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,340
 some of the stuff we've seen in the news this week

632
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,900
 about how some of our Filipino sisters in this city

633
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,060
 have been handled is disgraceful.

634
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,020
 We should call out the reality

635
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,260
 when these things take place.

636
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,940
 I experienced this personally in my life

637
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,240
 just a few weeks ago.

638
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,500
 My wife and I, along with our helper, Lizelle,

639
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,940
 wanted to get our booster for the vaccine.

640
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,020
 We'd already been double-dosed

641
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,460
 and we wanted to get our booster now.

642
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,140
 And so I jumped on the website

643
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,140
 to be able to sign the three of us up to get boosted.

644
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,580
 And the cases were increasing here in Hong Kong.

645
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,260
 And so we wanted to get it done sooner than later.

646
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,380
 And here's what happened.

647
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,980
 As I filled in the forms,

648
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,780
 I realized that for my wife and I,

649
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,820
 I was able to book a time

650
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,980
 that was just two days after the day that I was booking.

651
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,860
 But for my helper,

652
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,340
 I wasn't able to book her a time for three weeks.

653
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,180
 Why?

654
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,060
 Simply because she held a different ID card

655
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,140
 than what I held.

656
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,300
 Simply because helpers

657
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,220
 were not allowed to get vaccinated first.

658
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,340
 I thought that was disgraceful.

659
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,740
 And the reality is that so often in a crisis,

660
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,020
 it reveals where our true values are.

661
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,860
 So often crisis can show us what's actually inside of us.

662
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,460
 And we need a fresh revelation, not just in the church,

663
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,160
 but in our city and in society as well,

664
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,160
 that shakes us out of some of these racist,

665
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,080
 some of these tribalistic, classist impressions that we have.

666
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,480
 And we need to be grounded again in the word of God.

667
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,000
 New wine into new wineskins.

668
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,080
 You still with me, everyone?

669
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,800
 Still following with this?

670
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,120
 Now, this is exactly what Peter needed.

671
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,000
 And that was exactly what Peter received.

672
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,480
 So much so that I wanna show you

673
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,720
 what he says here in verse 23.

674
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,040
 He says it this way.

675
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,120
 He says, "Then Peter invited the three men

676
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,800
 that had been sent by Cornelius

677
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,680
 into his house to be his guests."

678
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,840
 That sounds again like a very normal thing.

679
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,680
 That is revolutionary.

680
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,800
 Peter is taking three Gentiles

681
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,640
 into his house to be his guests.

682
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,480
 Why?

683
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,280
 Because through the dream he had received,

684
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,120
 he now has a fresh revelation about the heart of God.

685
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,280
 He knows now that God is not seeing Gentiles

686
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,600
 as unclean anymore.

687
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,880
 He understands that if he's in relationship with Gentiles,

688
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,000
 if he's sharing food and fellowship with them,

689
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,600
 he's not gonna be seen as impure anymore

690
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,920
 'cause we should not call unclean or impure

691
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,640
 the things that God has called clean and pure.

692
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,480
 And so he invites them into his house.

693
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,400
 And in fact, later on,

694
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,000
 when he shows up at Cornelius' house,

695
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,960
 he explains why he has done that.

696
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,160
 Let me read this to you from verse 28.

697
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,040
 He says this.

698
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,480
 "He said to them, 'You are well aware

699
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
 that it is against our law for a Jew

700
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,560
 to associate with a Gentile or visit him.

701
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,680
 But God has shown me that I should not call

702
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,880
 any man impure or unclean.'"

703
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,720
 I love this.

704
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,080
 He says, "You know that it is our law."

705
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,120
 Notice he doesn't say God's law.

706
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,520
 He says, "Our law, our rabbinical traditions,

707
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,360
 our customs and our traditions

708
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,120
 has created a barrier ethnically between the ethnic other.

709
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,280
 And it is not right.

710
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,920
 And God has broken in by the power of his spirit

711
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,200
 to help me to understand that that isn't right.

712
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,160
 And I now know that I shouldn't call anybody unclean

713
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,560
 or impure that God sees value in, that God loves,

714
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,440
 that God has created in his image."

715
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,680
 This is Peter beginning to totally cross over

716
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,880
 to the other side.

717
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,880
 This is completely new thinking for him.

718
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,840
 So much so that he can sit there in this room

719
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,160
 and preach the gospel to these people.

720
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,340
 And so much so that this happens.

721
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,680
 Have a look in verse 44 and 46.

722
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,920
 "While Peter was still speaking these words,

723
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,360
 the Holy Spirit came on all who heard his message.

724
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,320
 The circumcised believers who had come with Peter

725
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,800
 were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit

726
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,760
 had been poured out even on the Gentiles."

727
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,600
 I love that.

728
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,240
 "Even on the Gentiles, even on those unclean ones,

729
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,120
 even on those ones that we had rejected,

730
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,640
 even on the ethnically other,

731
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,240
 the ones that we thought were disgusting in God's eyes,

732
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,640
 God's spirit has poured out even on them.

733
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,720
 For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God."

734
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,520
 This dramatically changes everything.

735
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,820
 God does something in their midst

736
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,280
 that he had never done before.

737
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,000
 Peter sees the Holy Spirit come upon those

738
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,680
 that up to that point he had seen as unclean.

739
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,680
 This is Peter going from the elder brother to the father,

740
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,560
 realizing now that he is the one

741
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,760
 that should throw a party for everyone

742
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,040
 because God's grace has broken over man's laws.

743
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,160
 That God's grace is always greater

744
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,940
 than our customs and traditions.

745
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,400
 That God's law has come

746
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,120
 and he opens his heart to a fresh way of thinking.

747
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,660
 A fresh way of thinking, my friends,

748
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,880
 that completely transforms the church.

749
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,480
 In fact, this creates a new wine skin for the church.

750
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,280
 And Peter is able to connect vision to mission.

751
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,040
 And from this point, they can take up Jesus' words

752
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,920
 that says, "Take the gospel, not just to Jerusalem,

753
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,280
 but to Judea and Samaria and the ends of the earth."

754
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,080
 That this was Genesis 12,

755
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,040
 the calling of Abraham come to its fruition.

756
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,320
 The idea that, "Oh, look up into the skies

757
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,960
 and all of these people, the Jewish people,

758
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,620
 will be a blessing to every nation."

759
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,800
 This is the moment where Peter and the early church

760
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,520
 finally understood what was on God's heart

761
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,780
 from right at the beginning of all time,

762
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,380
 that the Gentiles, anyone, you and me,

763
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,620
 are able to receive the power of the Holy Spirit

764
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,580
 for salvation and life.

765
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,980
 If you're watching this right now,

766
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,740
 you're not Jewish and you believe in Jesus.

767
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,300
 That's because of this moment right here.

768
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,620
 This moment where the new wine of God's power pours out

769
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,840
 and the church decides to build a new wine skin.

770
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,740
 Now, it wasn't easy for them.

771
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,860
 In fact, they would have a lot of arguments about this.

772
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,660
 You can read later in Acts 14 and 15

773
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,340
 about the Jerusalem council and how they wrestled

774
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,180
 with this new theology,

775
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,420
 with this new reality of the presence of God

776
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,380
 poured out on people that they didn't think

777
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,820
 the presence of God should pour out on.

778
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,620
 It wasn't an easy transition for them,

779
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,820
 but that transition certainly took place.

780
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,620
 And I want you to see why that transition took place.

781
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,100
 Notice this, track with this.

782
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,180
 See, God gives a dream to two people

783
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,960
 that causes a dramatic shift in their thinking

784
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,700
 that breaks down the dividing walls between them

785
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,420
 through an outpouring of the Holy Spirit

786
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,820
 that changes all history.

787
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,220
 Isn't that amazing, church?

788
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,980
 A dream comes, the dream changes their thinking.

789
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,820
 The change in their thinking breaks down the walls,

790
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,020
 the dividing walls between them,

791
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,920
 and that results in the spirit of God

792
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,800
 being unleashed on earth like never before.

793
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,480
 And the question we've got to ask ourselves

794
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,960
 when we read a passage like this is simply this,

795
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,960
 what dividing walls are there still existing in us today?

796
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,600
 What dividing walls are present for us

797
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
 that the Holy Spirit right here in Hong Kong

798
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,120
 might by His power want to bring some new dreams,

799
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,840
 some new wine for the old wineskin,

800
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,320
 new wine that gets placed in a new church,

801
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,920
 a new people, a new people that are open

802
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,960
 to hearing God's new word who are saying,

803
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,240
 "This is the way we now need to live."

804
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,680
 That these dividing walls,

805
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,960
 the other that we were once afraid of,

806
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,660
 we're gonna break down those walls

807
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,640
 because the spirit of God brings unity.

808
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,480
 Where are our dividing walls in Hong Kong right now?

809
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,760
 I wonder if there's a future where yellow and blue

810
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,120
 could find unity through the spirit of God.

811
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,400
 I wonder if there's a future where Hong Kong people

812
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,040
 and mainland Chinese might find unity

813
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,800
 through the spirit of God.

814
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,140
 I wonder if there's a future here

815
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,220
 where the ethnic minority in our cities

816
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,120
 might be seen with the same value as everybody else.

817
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,120
 I wonder if new wine is being poured into new wineskins.

818
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,840
 How can we respond with this fresh revelation?

819
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,560
 How can we receive it?

820
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,920
 'Cause if you're listening to this right now

821
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,040
 and you're anything like me, I'd be like,

822
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,520
 "Well, this sounds really good.

823
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,960
 I wanna have a Peter moment."

824
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,080
 Or maybe I wanna have a moment like Andrew did

825
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,320
 and got that vision and was able to speak in Hebrew.

826
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,640
 Maybe some of you are younger here,

827
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,880
 got a Spanish test coming up

828
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,480
 and you're praying for that dream right now.

829
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,320
 I'm with you.

830
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,480
 Okay, how do we position ourselves

831
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,720
 to receive this from God?

832
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,240
 Well, I think we see three very quick practical things

833
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,460
 in the passages that we've just been reading today.

834
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,400
 The first one is this.

835
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,080
 We have to position ourselves for revelation.

836
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,160
 Position ourselves for that revelation.

837
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,320
 Notice in both Cornelius and in Peter,

838
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,780
 they were both going about their usual activity

839
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,720
 and habit of praying.

840
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,020
 And in that moment of prayer,

841
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,000
 God is able to break in and bring his revelation.

842
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,680
 Notice that not all customs and traditions are bad, right?

843
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,280
 There are many good and healthy ones.

844
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,440
 And our regular practice of praying,

845
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,160
 our regular practice of coming before God

846
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,400
 and relationship with him is exactly part of that.

847
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,860
 Both Cornelius and Peter going about their normal,

848
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,640
 everyday committed, habitual relationship

849
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,800
 with God in prayer positions themselves

850
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,240
 for receiving revelation.

851
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,400
 Some of you are wanting revelation for God,

852
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,240
 but you're not doing anything practically

853
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,760
 to bring it about in your life.

854
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,560
 Some of you need to re-engage

855
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,920
 in a prayerful relationship with him.

856
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
 God wants to bring his dreams,

857
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,640
 but so often those dreams come when we close our eyes

858
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,560
 and position ourselves to hear from him.

859
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,960
 So first of all, position yourself for revelation.

860
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,960
 Second of all is this, look for confirmation.

861
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,880
 Look for confirmation.

862
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,200
 It blows my mind that Cornelius, the Gentile,

863
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,380
 and Peter, the faithful Jew,

864
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,940
 receive the same dream from God.

865
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,200
 God is trying to connect the two of them together

866
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,360
 by giving them the same dream at the same time.

867
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,080
 And both of those dreams disrupt the ways

868
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,000
 in which they traditionally thought

869
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,300
 to bring them into a new relationship

870
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,600
 together with new thinking.

871
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,760
 Look for confirmation

872
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,440
 when God brings a fresh revelation to you.

873
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,860
 Don't just jump out and start acting on it.

874
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,040
 Look for the confirmation that God is gonna bring

875
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,960
 that that fresh revelation is truly from him.

876
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,480
 And so often that confirmation comes,

877
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,840
 particularly if it's about repairing any dividing walls,

878
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,880
 that confirmation will come

879
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,760
 because God will be preparing that other person

880
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,380
 to receive also that reconciliation,

881
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,880
 that crossing over the divide to them.

882
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,000
 And I wanna encourage you to be on the lookout

883
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,920
 for that kind of confirmation.

884
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,280
 God moves, not just by giving you a dream,

885
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,520
 but by preparing the people around you for the shift.

886
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,680
 And I believe this is what the Holy Spirit's doing

887
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,240
 with the church in Hong Kong right now.

888
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,640
 I think he's shifting us.

889
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,960
 He's shaking us up.

890
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,620
 He's bringing fresh revelation around us all

891
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,100
 so that we can begin to truly be the new wineskin

892
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,060
 that Hong Kong needs in this hour and this time.

893
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,380
 Here's the third and final thing.

894
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,420
 Look for the fruit of the Holy Spirit to be present.

895
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,140
 We know that we can judge something by its fruit.

896
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,720
 And both here, we have Cornelius and Peter

897
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,220
 gathered in that room and the Holy Spirit pours out.

898
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,340
 And Peter immediately knows,

899
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,060
 well, that is the fruit that I need to know

900
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,980
 that this is truly a work of God,

901
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,240
 that this is truly a move of God,

902
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,940
 that it's not just my new thinking,

903
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,880
 it's not just my fresh understanding,

904
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,020
 but God is truly in this

905
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,620
 because I can see the fruit of his Spirit in it.

906
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,700
 How do we know that the revelation we received

907
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,140
 is fresh from God, that it is truly his,

908
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,220
 that it is confirmed by those around us

909
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,260
 while we look for the fruit?

910
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,340
 Does it bring the fruit of the Spirit in our lives

911
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,980
 and in the lives of those around us?

912
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,840
 Does it bring more love and joy and peace and patience

913
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,540
 and kindness and goodness and faithfulness

914
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,500
 and gentleness and self-control?

915
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,460
 Because if it does, then we know

916
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,780
 that this is God's work amongst us.

917
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,540
 We look for the fruit of the Spirit

918
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,380
 and that helps us to understand

919
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,500
 that the fresh revelation we have

920
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,880
 is truly from the source of God himself.

921
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,820
 Friends, we need new wine to be poured into new wineskins.

922
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,100
 What that means is a number of things for us.

923
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,860
 It means that we need to be ready and prepared to change.

924
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,580
 It means that we need to be open

925
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,700
 to the ways in which we might need to think differently,

926
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,300
 to adapt to the times, to let go of some of the things

927
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,580
 that we had previously held tightly onto

928
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,520
 so that we can grab a hold

929
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,080
 of the new thing God is bringing.

930
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,180
 It means that we need to be willing

931
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,940
 to take a good, hard, honest look

932
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,020
 at some of our traditional customs and practices

933
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,160
 that we've just always done

934
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,320
 that are actually creating a dividing wall

935
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,420
 between us and the other, whoever that might be.

936
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,280
 It means that we need to ask ourselves

937
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,780
 the difficult question of who is the Gentile to us?

938
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,200
 Who is the one that we think if we spent time with them,

939
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,700
 we would become unclean, we would become impure,

940
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,120
 we would be in the wrong?

941
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,640
 Who is the other that we are afraid of,

942
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,400
 the one that we're not sure about,

943
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,320
 the one that we try to avoid?

944
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,640
 Who's become the Gentile?

945
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,000
 Because perhaps God wants to bring

946
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,400
 some fresh revelation to us about them.

947
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,000
 One thing we learn from this text above everything else

948
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,600
 is that there is no human being in God's eyes

949
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,560
 who is unclean and impure,

950
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,380
 that there is no one that we should reject,

951
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,220
 shun, turn our backs on, walk away from,

952
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,560
 that everyone, as it says in this passage,

953
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,160
 everyone is treated equitably by God,

954
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,960
 that God has created us in His image

955
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,160
 and He loves every single one of us.

956
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,240
 And I think this passage also does this for us.

957
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,560
 It challenges us in this way,

958
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,240
 that like Peter, we have to realise

959
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,180
 that in order to learn some new habits,

960
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,960
 we actually have to, first of all, unlearn some old ones.

961
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,960
 And sometimes the unlearning of the old requires repentance,

962
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,200
 requires us being honest that we had it wrong,

963
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,260
 requires us being honest about the dividing walls

964
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,840
 that our personal preferences had created

965
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,120
 and around our lives.

966
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,360
 It requires us getting on our knees

967
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,560
 and saying the rabbinical law, Lord,

968
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,720
 I had allowed to stand over the Torah law, Your word,

969
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,560
 that my desires became more important to me

970
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,620
 than Your true word.

971
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,640
 Perhaps as we close this series,

972
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,400
 as we think about what it is for us to truly dream again,

973
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,300
 as we receive this new wine of God's dreams,

974
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,720
 we have to say, Lord, I remove that metal gate

975
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,480
 from in front of Your fire.

976
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,000
 I don't wanna be protected from the things

977
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,720
 that Your Spirit truly wants to do

978
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,260
 in and through me right now.

979
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,160
 Lord, I wanna be open to the fresh revelation.

980
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,920
 Lord, forgive me where I've put some dividing walls down,

981
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,960
 where I've made my personal preferences

982
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,320
 more important to me than Your truth.

983
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,480
 Forgive me, Lord, where I've come to look

984
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,880
 at the ethnically other differently,

985
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,420
 where I've put more value on myself than I have on them.

986
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,340
 Lord, would You come and bring such fresh revelation

987
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,420
 that I actually am now thinking

988
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,920
 about the kingdom of God differently.

989
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,580
 Bring Your Spirit, bring Your power

990
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,980
 so we can dream the sort of dreams

991
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,460
 and be the kind of church God wants for Hong Kong

992
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,140
 in this time and this hour.

993
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,260
 Church, it is time for us to dream again.

994
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,260
 May His new wine be poured into our new wineskin.

995
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,360
 Lord, bring Your fresh revelation for each one of us.

996
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,600
 Would you pray with me?

997
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,320
 Let's pray together.

998
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,040
 Father, we just thank You so much for this truth today,

999
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,260
 that Lord, You bring at times a new way of thinking,

1000
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:03,280
 a new way of believing that enables us to let go

1001
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,620
 of some of the things that have created barriers

1002
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,300
 between us and the fresh thing that You're doing on earth.

1003
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,380
 Lord, I wanna pray that where this might be a reality

1004
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,740
 for many of us watching this right now.

1005
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,380
 Lord, I wanna pray that You would challenge us deeply

1006
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,940
 to be open, positioned

1007
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,160
 for Your fresh revelation in this season.

1008
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,560
 Lord, would You enable us to unlearn some old habits?

1009
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,500
 Habits that may not be the best

1010
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,500
 for what it is that You're doing at this time.

1011
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,080
 Lord, would You give us the courage to embrace grace?

1012
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,740
 Lord, would Your grace enable us to let go

1013
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,720
 where we've put our traditions above You?

1014
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,140
 And Lord, I wanna pray, Father, that Your fire would fall,

1015
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:03,140
 that we would let go of the things, Lord.

1016
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,460
 That actually hold us back,

1017
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,320
 that the sparks that we've protected ourselves from

1018
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,980
 that are designed to set fire to our lives, Lord, would come.

1019
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:17,400
 Lord, that new wine, Your dreams.

1020
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,920
 Forgive us, Lord, while we stuff those new wines

1021
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,320
 and new dreams into the old wineskins

1022
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,260
 of the way that we've always done things as a church.

1023
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,120
 Lord, I pray for those that need it,

1024
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,700
 that Lord, You would completely revolutionise

1025
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,380
 their thinking about Your Spirit.

1026
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,480
 That You are good, God.

1027
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,320
 That You love us so much.

1028
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,900
 And Lord, if we've ever put You in a box,

1029
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,180
 or if You're in a box in our lives right now,

1030
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,540
 Lord, would You break out of the box, Lord?

1031
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,560
 Lord, we thank You that Peter and Cornelius

1032
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,660
 were able to allow You to break out of their boxes.

1033
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,340
 And in them coming together

1034
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,540
 and the power of the Spirit at work in that moment,

1035
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,260
 the whole church was changed forever.

1036
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,620
 Lord, I believe we need another moment like that

1037
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,780
 in Hong Kong right now.

1038
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,140
 I believe we need a pouring out of Your Holy Spirit, Lord,

1039
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,780
 that would shake us out of the boxes

1040
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,080
 that we put ourselves in,

1041
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,100
 so that we might be able to truly bring unity,

1042
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:32,100
 reconciliation and hope to this place in this time.

1043
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,840
 So Lord, come now, bring Your new wine

1044
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,200
 and may it find its fertile soil

1045
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,620
 in the new wineskins of our heart.

1046
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,900
 And we thank You for this, in Jesus' Name.

1047
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,280
 Everyone says, Amen.

1048
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:57,280
