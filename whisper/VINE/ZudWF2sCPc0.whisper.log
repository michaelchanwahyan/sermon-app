[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   - In your name, Jesus.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.200]   - Amen.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.040]   - Amen.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.920]   When I was in university, my senior year of university,
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.760]   I had quite an amazing senior year.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.600]   And it was a lot of spiritually quite rich experiences.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200]   And one of them was, I started this conversation
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.720]   with a childhood friend.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.480]   Now, he was not a Christian, but we were talking about faith
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.560]   and this was almost weekly.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.200]   And he asked a lot of like challenging questions.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.160]   This was, were not easy conversations,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.060]   but they were very enriching.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.160]   And it culminated with my friend coming to know Jesus,
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.560]   which was amazing.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.120]   And actually he's a pastor here in Hong Kong as well.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.620]   So I got my German buddy here.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.800]   And so for me, my senior year was something
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.200]   where I grew in faith and it was just incredible.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.560]   Then I graduated, I started a job with Sherman Williams,
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.380]   a paint and coating manufacturer distributor,
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.280]   one of the largest ones in the world.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.680]   And at first things were going well.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.360]   Then the company moved me from Central California.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.300]   We had a lot of friends, I had a network.
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.720]   I went one year to high school there.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.620]   They moved me to the California coast, to Monterey.
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.560]   And Monterey, if you don't know California,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.040]   it's along the coast, it's a beautiful place.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.400]   But for me, it actually turned out to be
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.080]   a really challenging time in my life
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.880]   where I made a lot of bad choices
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.840]   that I'm not very proud of.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.040]   You could also say I was living in habitual sin
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.800]   and just brokenness.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   And so I went from this mountain peak experience
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.720]   my senior year in university,
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.560]   and this first year of working coming out of college,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.560]   I found myself in this bottom pit in the valley.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.460]   And I was not the person that I wanted to be.
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.280]   I knew this was not the life I wanna live,
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.380]   but I just was there and I was stuck there.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.020]   And it was also not the life that God called me to live.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.340]   And I wanted to change, I wanted things to change,
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.780]   but I didn't really know how or what to do.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.000]   So what do you do when you find yourselves in those places,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.560]   when you're not living the way
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.680]   that you know God is calling you to live,
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.000]   when you're not the person that you wanna be?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.600]   You know, what do you do?
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.320]   Well, as you have been going through the series on Ephesians,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.440]   God's word is quite clear,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.240]   that especially in the chapters one through three,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.800]   it talks about how Jesus is saving,
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.160]   healing work in our lives.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.720]   You know, that we were dead in our sins,
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.040]   but that we have been made alive in Christ.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.660]   And then last week, Pastor Andrew,
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.880]   he talked about that God was shaped a community,
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.880]   a church community, that it has become a maturing community
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.900]   where we can grow, where we can change,
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.800]   where our lives can be transformed,
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.180]   where we can attain to the full measure
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.800]   of the wholeness of Christ Jesus,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.640]   that we can start reflecting his character.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.880]   You know, and that is amazing news, if you think about it.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   Like, we can really change.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.800]   We don't have to stay the same.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.200]   Now, I think that some of us here,
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.480]   you know, maybe we have family history of,
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.720]   you know, whatever is broken, relationship, addiction,
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.360]   and maybe we find ourselves stuck in that as well.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.040]   And perhaps we've bought into this lie
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.600]   that life cannot change.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.160]   This is just the way it's going to be.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   And so what God's word says, and also the church community,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.640]   and the testimonies of people says that you can change.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.120]   And so here at Divine, we believe that Jesus has the power
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.680]   to transform and change your life.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.200]   And one thing I love in Ephesians 2.10, it says this,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.760]   for we are God's handiwork created in Christ Jesus
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.680]   So that means that when God looks at you,
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.220]   he sees all your potential.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.200]   He sees all that you can be that he created you for,
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.880]   and his heart longs for that in your life to unfold.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.620]   He desires to see that unfold in you.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.160]   And so he can bring that about this transformation
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.520]   and change, so just really sense for the day
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.080]   that some of us, some of us maybe have gotten comfortable
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.520]   where we are, and today maybe the Holy Spirit
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.160]   is gonna bring some conviction
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160]   and just calling us to something better.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.760]   But for others of us, we've bought into the lie
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.680]   where we're like, you know, I don't know if I'll ever change.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.200]   I tried, but nothing happened.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.960]   And I believe that Jesus wants to say,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.200]   I can bring true change in your life.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.120]   You do not have to continue in this way.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.220]   You know, I can bring wholeness,
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.160]   where there's brokenness, where there's pain.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.000]   And so what I wanna do with you today in this message,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.840]   I wanna explore a question with you,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.520]   'cause we all have a choice.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.020]   Do we remain in immaturity?
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.900]   You know, as Christians where we live ineffective lives,
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.520]   actually last week, Pastor Andrew said something
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.400]   quite powerful, he said this.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.840]   He said, if the enemy can't keep you from being a Christian,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.280]   then the next best thing for him to do
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.140]   is to keep you from being a mature and effective one.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:03.560]   And so what I wanna look with you at today is,
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.160]   you know, how can we be a mature and effective Christian
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.840]   and continue the conversation
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.980]   that Pastor Andrew started last week?
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.000]   You know, how can we say yes
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.480]   to the Holy Spirit's transformed work in our lives?
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.980]   Now, what does that look like?
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.000]   How do we engage this change process
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.040]   where Jesus just wants to bring wholeness
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.900]   into your life, into our lives, into my life?
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.200]   Well, let me take you to Ephesians 4,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.240]   we're starting with 17, it says this.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.920]   So I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord,
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.860]   that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.740]   in the futility of their thinking.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.760]   They are darkened in their understanding
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.100]   and separated from the life of God
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.100]   because of ignorance that is in them
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.660]   due to the hardening of their hearts.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.900]   Having lost all sensitivity,
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.460]   they have given themselves over to sensuality,
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.300]   so as to indulge in every kind of impurity
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.480]   and they are full of greed.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.920]   That, however, is not the way of life you learned
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   when you heard about Christ and were taught in him
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.040]   in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.760]   You were taught with regard to your former way of life
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.680]   to put off your old self,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.720]   which was being corrupted by deceitful desires,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   to be made new in the attitude of your minds,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.680]   and to put on the new self,
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.560]   created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.280]   Now, this all starts out with Paul saying, "So."
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.300]   So all of this builds on what Paul has said before,
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.380]   and this is really important
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.180]   because in the first three chapters of Ephesians,
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.700]   Paul talks about the incredible saving work
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.460]   that Jesus has done.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.460]   He talks about all the blessings that flow from Jesus.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.820]   We're adopted, we're justified, we're made righteous,
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.180]   we're brought together as one family of God,
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.340]   and you create a new humanity
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.020]   where people from all walks of life
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.620]   become a spiritual family.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.500]   And it's all these incredible things that Paul talks about
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.140]   because he wants Ephesians
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.540]   to understand their identity as Christians.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.420]   They have a new identity,
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.300]   and they need to understand the love of Jesus
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.180]   before he moves into how to now live.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.300]   Because how we live is always a response
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.820]   to the love and the work and the grace
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.460]   and the mercy of Jesus.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.980]   So that's always a starting point.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.900]   We have to keep that in mind
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.800]   as we go through the message today.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.100]   So Paul is now telling the Gentile Christians
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.100]   that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.340]   Now, that's interesting.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.460]   He's talking to Gentiles.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.540]   He tells them you must no longer live as Gentiles do.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.820]   So what does he mean by that?
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.340]   He doesn't want them to return to their old life,
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.060]   their old way of living,
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.740]   their old patterns of brokenness, of sinfulness.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.620]   He wants them to make a clean cut
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.940]   and to live in a new way
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.740]   'cause Jesus has done something new in them.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.380]   They are a new creation.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.860]   They've been given a new identity,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.660]   and he wants them to live out that new identity.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.020]   So verse 17 through 19,
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.580]   it describes basically their life before they knew Jesus.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.780]   And one of the main characteristics that Paul describes
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.420]   and is asking them not to return to
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.660]   is the futility of their thinking
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.300]   because he knows that futile thinking
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.260]   leads to futile living.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.980]   Like how we think about something
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.500]   actually impacts how we live it out.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.140]   And he doesn't want them to go back
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.540]   to their old ways of thinking.
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.900]   Now, the word futility, the Greek word,
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.740]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.140]   means three things.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.300]   Futility, meaninglessness, and empty.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.220]   And Paul does not want Ephesian Christians
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.580]   to go back to empty, meaningless ways.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.620]   But if you think about the word futility,
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.380]   there's actually a lot of pain in that word
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.540]   'cause if you're striving, if you're trying,
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.020]   but you never are satisfied, you never arrive,
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.260]   man, that's tiring.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.700]   It's not a fun journey.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.660]   And so Paul's saying, why would you return to that,
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.060]   to this striving,
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.660]   where you're never truly satisfied?
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.180]   Maybe think, if I reach this achievement,
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.540]   then I'll be truly satisfied.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.940]   So we chase after it, and then we have it,
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.780]   and there is some satisfaction in it,
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.100]   but then soon we want the next achievement
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.740]   because that one's not enough.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.860]   Or maybe it's, we engage in,
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.140]   a relationship, we think that this relationship
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.140]   is gonna satisfy us,
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.860]   but then there's still, it doesn't fully satisfy us,
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.540]   and so then we go into the next relationship,
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.860]   and so on and on.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.780]   So it's this empty chasing.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:14.220]   And so Paul says, why would you return to that?
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.820]   Why would you go back to that?
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.980]   I've given you a new life.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.660]   I've given you a new identity.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.900]   So then in verse 19, Paul says that ultimately,
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.180]   this life, when we live in futility,
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.980]   and we go down that route,
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.820]   is a life that is a life where we're living
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.740]   in separation from God.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.100]   It's a life apart from God.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.660]   And again, why would you go back to that?
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.140]   Now for me, when I was in Monterey,
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.340]   I went into an environment where I didn't know anyone,
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.580]   and so I went back to my old life,
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.380]   to my old patterns, my old ways of living.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.220]   And sometimes there is comfort in that,
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.260]   but it never truly satisfies,
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.340]   and so I went back to these patterns of brokenness,
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.500]   of selfishness, of sinfulness.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.300]   And then for some of you, that might be that way as well,
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.140]   that you've become a Christian,
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.940]   you've been given this new identity,
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.900]   but for whatever reason,
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.340]   you've been going back to your old way of living,
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.420]   and you're also like, I was at that point,
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.020]   you're not who you want to be,
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.140]   and you know you're also not who God is calling you to be,
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.660]   who has created you to be,
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.660]   'cause you're a new creation,
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.220]   he has something good, something beautiful for you.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:32.140]   Now, let's continue verse 20 and 21.
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:32.980]   So there it says,
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.900]   "That, however, is not the way of life you learned
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.620]   "when you heard about Christ,
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.140]   "and were taught in him accordance with the truth
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.860]   "that is in Jesus."
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.340]   So Paul and other leaders,
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.700]   they were teaching the new Ephesian Christians,
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.060]   they were teaching them what it means to follow Jesus,
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.980]   they were not teaching them a bunch of rules to observe,
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.540]   but it was centered around the person of Jesus,
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.500]   'cause our faith has to do
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.980]   with a personal relationship with Jesus,
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.700]   and so they were teaching them
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.380]   how to live in a relationship with Jesus,
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.820]   instead of going back to,
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.620]   like we're not in a relationship with Jesus.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.420]   Now, this did involve the aspects,
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.780]   it talks about truth that is in Jesus,
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.020]   that does refer to his historical life,
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.140]   where he's fully human, fully divine,
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.180]   but he did his miracles, his ministry,
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.900]   he died, he rose,
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.740]   all those things we do need to learn about,
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.180]   but ultimately, Paul was saying,
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.060]   why, that's not what we taught you to go back to your old ways,
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.940]   we taught you to live in that relationship with Jesus.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.780]   So that's what he's inviting them.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.460]   Start relating again,
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.500]   start engaging that relationship again.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.180]   I think that's perhaps something
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.100]   that God is saying to some of us today,
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.860]   start engaging again that relationship with Jesus.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.460]   Don't go back to that old way, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.860]   So the essence of the Christian life
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.820]   is not a rigid set of rules,
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.060]   but a vibrant, transformative relationship with Jesus.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.220]   So as we grow closer to him,
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.060]   and seek to honor him in all we do,
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.700]   we'll discover the true freedom and purpose
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.380]   in found and walking with him.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:27.780]   So that's Paul, he's like reminding them of their identity,
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.780]   he's reminding them, hey, this is what you learned,
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.620]   this is what we taught you, this way of life,
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.820]   now live this way of life,
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.740]   don't go back to the old way of life.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.460]   But then he turns to, how do we put on the old self,
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.900]   the new self, and renew the attitude of our minds,
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.940]   so he turns to all of that,
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.620]   and that's really what I wanna focus on today,
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.820]   because I think that's really where this transformation,
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.980]   this change is found,
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.180]   where God's really telling us something.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.100]   So let me read that, verse 22.
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.060]   "You were taught with regard to your former way of life
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.820]   "to put off your old self,
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.380]   "which was being corrupted by its deceitful desires,
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.180]   "to be made new in the attitude of your minds,
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.260]   "and to put on the new self created to be like God
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.860]   "in true righteousness and holiness."
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.580]   So Paul, in this, he's actually,
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.260]   I think, making a really important point,
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.140]   because he talks about putting off and putting on.
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:30.060]   What it points to is that even though we become Christians,
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.060]   there is still stuff in our lives
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.540]   that needs to be worked out.
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:40.020]   There are still things that are not fully there yet,
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.020]   there is still brokenness in our lives,
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.220]   there is still sin in our lives,
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.860]   and this is true for everyone.
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.780]   We're living in this already but not fully yet part.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.540]   So this is what Paul is talking about,
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.300]   and the word, the theological word for that is sanctification.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.700]   So what I wanna do is I wanna talk about that,
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.420]   but I wanna put it in a broader theological frame
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.460]   or conversation.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.460]   The Bible talks about that we are saved,
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.380]   or we were saved, we are saved,
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.020]   we are being saved, and we will be saved.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.980]   So like past, present, future.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.540]   And so when it talks about you were saved,
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.020]   it's talking about justification.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.500]   When it talks about we are being saved,
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.220]   it talks about sanctification.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.700]   And when it talks about we will be saved,
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.660]   it talks about glorification.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.900]   Now let me unpack those a little bit.
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.900]   So justification is what Ephesians chapter one through three
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.660]   covers a lot.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.380]   It's like Jesus died for your sins,
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.460]   you were dead in your sins,
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.700]   you were made alive in Christ by grace through faith,
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.460]   and you are declared,
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.020]   you're justified, you're declared righteous.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.500]   So there's like a legal metaphor
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.260]   that God has spoken this legal sentence over your life.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.060]   When God now looks at you,
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.180]   he sees the righteousness of Jesus
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.860]   in place of your sinful self that he has forgiven you for.
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.380]   So that's justification.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.820]   And let's move to glorification.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.780]   Glorification is when Jesus,
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.180]   when Christ has completed his saving,
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.020]   his healing work in your life.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.580]   You know, one day God's work with us will be completed,
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.700]   will be completely whole,
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.220]   there will be no more pain, no more tears.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.540]   And so that's glorification.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.100]   But then right now,
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.780]   most of us we're living in a sanctification space
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.060]   where we are more and more
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.620]   becoming who Jesus is calling us to be.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.460]   We're not fully yet who we know we're meant to be,
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.300]   but God is not finished with us yet.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.420]   He's not finished with you yet,
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.300]   and he's working things out.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.820]   And sanctification is really about being made holy.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:57.940]   It's about putting on the character of Christ
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.540]   that we reflect Christ's character more and more
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.820]   in all the spheres of our influence,
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.820]   you know, on all parts of our lives.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.100]   That when people look at you,
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.340]   they can see a bit more and more Jesus in you
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.140]   because you can see your love, your grace,
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.180]   how you treat people.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.260]   So that's what sanctification is about.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.780]   And that's what this passage is really talking about.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.540]   So let's unpack that a little bit.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.300]   So first in verse 22 talks about,
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.620]   "You were taught with regard to your former way of life
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.620]   "to put off your old self."
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.740]   Now, putting off the old self
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.660]   can also be translated, put off the old humanity.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.860]   Like we're, you know, we were saying earlier,
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.220]   death to death, you know, we died to being dead in our sin.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.980]   We've been raised to new life.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.740]   And so we're meant to keep putting that off.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.540]   We don't always live in the victory that Jesus has won,
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.020]   but we're meant to put this off.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.660]   Now, what does it mean to put off our old self?
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.660]   And what does that actually mean?
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.660]   Well, it's like turning away from our sinfulness,
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.700]   our brokenness.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.620]   It's like coming to Jesus, say,
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.100]   "Jesus, this is what's going on in my life, help me.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.420]   "I know I'm not who I wanna be.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.740]   "I know I'm not who you want me to be,
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.460]   "but help me to be that person."
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.100]   It's also has to do with the word repentance
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.660]   where we turn from whatever we're doing
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.980]   that we know doesn't honor God and say,
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.020]   "Jesus, I don't wanna live this way anymore.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.780]   "Forgive me, help me now from this point forward
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.580]   "to live by your grace, by your power, by your strength."
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:44.380]   That's what putting off our old self means.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.220]   And it happens in that relationship with Jesus
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.300]   that Paul taught the Ephesians.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.380]   You do that in a relationship.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.620]   It happens with that intimacy of Jesus
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.300]   that we've been talking about.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:00.860]   But notice verse two also talks about the old self
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.340]   as being corrupted by deceitful desires.
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.660]   So it's a life that seems to be good and enjoyable,
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.980]   but really it leaves us empty-handed and broken.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.860]   It's like false advertisement.
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.140]   You think you're getting something good,
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.420]   but you find yourself in shambles and more pain.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:26.500]   And some of you may feel that way.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.260]   Now, on the one hand, you're excited to be here.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.140]   You're like, "Man, I love worship.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.260]   "I love Jesus.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.900]   "I love this community,
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.260]   "and it's so good always to be here."
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.660]   But then on the other hand,
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.620]   you're still stuck in patterns of the past.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.300]   You've returned to part of your old life,
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.540]   and you're living in some of that brokenness.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.940]   So what do we do?
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.100]   Well, this passage actually provides an answer,
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.020]   a solution for us, and I wanna continue to unpack that.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.340]   That's also where we can address our question.
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.540]   So how do we say yes to the Holy Spirit's transforming
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.420]   and healing work in our lives?
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.820]   How do we say yes to that,
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.300]   that we can experience that change,
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.780]   that we can become more Christ-like,
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.180]   that we don't have to stay the same person?
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.580]   Maybe the ugliness that's in our heart or in our actions,
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.060]   maybe it's anger, whatever it may be,
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.460]   we don't have to stay there,
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.740]   and we can experience this transformation.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.380]   So here it goes.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.300]   While Christ has defeated sin on the cross,
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.180]   we don't always live in that victory.
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.860]   And so putting on and putting off
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.420]   is actually daily discipleship,
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.180]   it's daily relationship with Jesus.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.420]   And so we've already talked about the putting off part,
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.820]   but then in between the putting off the old self
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.380]   and putting on a new self, there's another line,
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.260]   so I wanna look at that with you.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.020]   It says that we,
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.460]   it says this, "To be made new in the attitudes of your mind."
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.300]   So God wants to do some renewing of our mind
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.100]   so that we're not stuck in the futility of our thinking.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.060]   And the Greek verb, "To be made new,"
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.820]   it's in a passive voice,
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:16.820]   and what that means is that we're not the agents
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.900]   that make ourselves new.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:23.460]   We do not renew ourselves,
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.620]   but God is the agent of renewal.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.340]   And I think that's really important for us to know,
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.140]   that whether it's with justification,
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.900]   sanctification, glorification,
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.580]   it is always 100% the work of God in our lives.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.100]   And He's the one that changes and renews us.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.940]   It's His power, it's not us, it's not your effort.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.780]   And I think sometimes we get stuck in our own efforts,
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.580]   where we try to make stuff happen out of our own
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.460]   and we fall short.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.380]   But we need to learn to surrender
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.740]   and rely on the power of God
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.020]   to bring about this change,
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.460]   'cause He's the one who changes us.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.220]   We don't do that ourselves.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.060]   But we are given part in the process
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.540]   where we can say yes to the Holy Spirit's work,
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.900]   and that's the putting off and the putting on.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.820]   Now what does putting on mean?
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.940]   A putting on, just very simply,
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.940]   means putting on the new self as obedience to Jesus.
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.380]   You know, that we do what Jesus says,
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.340]   that we do what the Holy Spirit is revealing to us.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.020]   And we don't always feel like that at first,
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.380]   but that's what putting on the new self means.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.420]   So God has given us this picture,
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.020]   and this actually comes from our daily putting on clothes
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.780]   and taking off clothes.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.580]   Take off the dirty clothes, put on the fresh clothes.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.020]   And that's what this imagery is about and comes from.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.340]   And when we do that,
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.660]   we start reflecting more and more
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.100]   that the true righteousness and holiness
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.220]   that we've been created for,
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.260]   and we give God, we give the Holy Spirit
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.940]   a space in our lives to move and to transform us
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.940]   as we put off the old self and we put on the new self.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.820]   And in that process, the Holy Spirit renews us
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.460]   and conforms our image more and more to Him.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.420]   And that's how we say yes to the Holy Spirit's work.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.620]   It's through daily putting off our old self
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.300]   and putting on the new self.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.860]   Now, through the imagery of putting off the old self
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:30.700]   and putting on the new self,
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.500]   Paul is saying, become what you are.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.100]   Live in line with your new identity
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.940]   that you have been given.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.500]   You're children of God.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.820]   Now reflect God, reflect your heavenly Father.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.420]   That's your identity, your new identity.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.100]   Now, you might again still wonder,
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.380]   like, well, what does that look like?
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.820]   So I wanna share a little bit with you.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.460]   When I was in university,
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.700]   I struggled really with one person that I knew.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.500]   Different personality, there was nothing wrong with him.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.860]   Just different personality, personality clash.
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.700]   And there was a lot of judgment in my heart towards him.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.340]   There was a lot of lack of grace.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.420]   You know, as Christians, we've been shown grace,
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.100]   we've been shown grace by Jesus,
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.140]   but then sometimes we turn around,
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.580]   we don't show grace to other people.
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.780]   Well, that was what was happening.
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.740]   And I knew I had a bad attitude,
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.580]   a bad way of thinking and feeling about this other person.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.660]   And it wasn't honoring God,
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.220]   and I was not the person I wanted to be.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.340]   But at that point, I wasn't admitting that to myself yet.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.380]   I hadn't gotten to that.
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:47.100]   So I received a package from my parents from Germany.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.500]   It was around Christmas, a little bit before Christmas,
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.220]   it was amazing, German chocolate.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.620]   And so he comes into the room,
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.660]   and I'm eating some chocolate,
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.740]   and he's like, "Ooh, I love chocolate."
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:02.300]   It's like, "German chocolate is my favorite chocolate."
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.060]   And I said, "Nein!
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.060]   Du kriegst keine Schokolade,
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.980]   you're not getting any chocolate."
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.420]   So I didn't say that.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.060]   But I knew what he was asking for,
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.860]   but I pretended like I didn't understand.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.820]   So I just kept eating my own chocolate.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.060]   It was not very nice.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.660]   Another occasion, I was trying to walk to class,
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.780]   and I was rushing to get there,
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.100]   and so he was blocking the hallway,
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.420]   and he's like, "You first gotta fight me
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.180]   if you wanna get past me."
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.540]   Now, he was saying this in a playful way.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.220]   So this was not like he was not really trying to fight me.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.460]   So he was just trying to relate to me and engage me.
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.580]   And he's like, "You first gotta fight me."
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.700]   And I was like, "I don't wanna fight you,
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.860]   I just actually wanna go to class."
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.300]   Again, this German anxiety about not being late.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.780]   It's like the biggest sin in Germany is to be late.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.580]   So I'm so anxious.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.420]   And so I asked him several times,
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.540]   and he didn't understand that I was serious.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.060]   And so I was like, I put him down on the ground,
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.780]   I was like, "I'm sorry, I really need to go to class."
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.340]   And so I went to class.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.860]   So it was just some personality things
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.860]   where I was just really struggling with that relationship.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.660]   Now, fast forward a year.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.660]   I signed up for a Christian community group on campus.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.300]   So I had no idea who I was gonna be placed with.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.900]   So I show up to our first meeting,
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.100]   the leader had called me, I show up, guess who's there?
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:31.340]   I felt like quitting right there when I saw him.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.060]   But then the Holy Spirit convicted me in my heart.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:38.540]   I knew that my feeling and my attitudes
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.860]   towards him were not right,
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.940]   and I was not who I wanted to be.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.740]   And it was not who God had called me to be.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.380]   And so I knew that God was asking me to stay in this group,
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.140]   and that there was something I needed to learn,
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.140]   even though I didn't feel like it.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.060]   But in this instance, I said yes.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.780]   So I ended up bringing my feelings, my thoughts,
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.540]   and prayer before Jesus, asked for patience,
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.500]   and grace over all of this.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.940]   And I also did what God was asking me to do,
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.980]   which was go to those meetings.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.100]   And so you see in this, there's the putting off.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.820]   Like I was acknowledging my feelings that were not right,
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.500]   and I was asking Jesus, help me with this.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.180]   I'm giving this to you.
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.380]   I know I'm not feeling, thinking about this the right way.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.420]   And then there was the putting on,
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.460]   the actually doing what was right,
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.260]   to keep going, to be there, to listen.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.020]   And this went on for two years.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.260]   And I can truly say that after two years,
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.980]   like it wasn't a chore for me
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.700]   to go to this community group anymore.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.220]   Like I loved the people there.
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.700]   I loved my brother.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.660]   And my heart had genuinely changed.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.140]   It was transformed.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.900]   Now I could not do this out of my own strength,
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.820]   but it was the power of God working in my life,
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.180]   changing my heart and my attitude.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.140]   Now, if I would listen to IG influencers,
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:13.580]   or YouTube influencers, they just tell you, do you.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.700]   Now, if I would do me in this instance,
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.820]   I would not go through all of that stuff.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.220]   I would not make myself do something
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.220]   I don't feel like doing.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.180]   And so we have to remember,
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.700]   what does all of this flow out of?
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.660]   Well, it's because of the love and grace of Jesus
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.060]   that he has shown me.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.220]   It's the work of the spirit of God in my life,
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.540]   and me just wanting to love Jesus back,
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.500]   and being the person that he has called me to be.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.860]   That's where all of this always flows from.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.380]   It always flows from there.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.980]   And so I want to invite the worship team
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.060]   to come up right now.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:55.660]   And I just want to invite you here today,
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.340]   as I have been sharing about putting off
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.980]   and putting on a new self, putting off our old self,
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.700]   like what things the Holy Spirit
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.620]   has been bringing to your mind?
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.340]   What he's been speaking to you about?
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:16.020]   And I just want to create some space right now
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:20.620]   where you can come yourself before Jesus,
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.100]   can respond to him in a way
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.260]   that he's inviting you to respond.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:29.740]   And I don't want you to play down this moment.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.980]   Like we sometimes, we treat things like this casually,
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.380]   yeah, whatever.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:38.420]   No, Jesus has the power to change and transform your life.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:43.060]   He has the power to change and transform your heart.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:49.740]   I believe he wants to release some faith in us
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.620]   that he can do this work.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.380]   So I have two questions up there
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.460]   to help us prayerfully reflect.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.900]   What are some areas in your life
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.740]   where you need to put off your old self
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.020]   and put on your new self?
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.980]   And the second one is, what are the parts of your life
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.860]   we are longing for God's healing and transforming work?
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:12.540]   'Cause a lot of times where we're living in our old self,
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.940]   there's actually a lot of brokenness.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.300]   We just want, we need God's love, we need God's healing.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.340]   So I just want to invite you right now
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.900]   for a couple of minutes just to pray,
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.660]   to come respond to the Holy Spirit's leading,
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.940]   and then I'll pray over us.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.780]   So let's do that right now.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.340]   Let's take this time to pray.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.940]   (gentle music)
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:48.300]   As we're praying, I'm reminded of the prodigal son
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.860]   in that parable in the Bible,
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.820]   where the prodigal son just returns to the father
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.020]   and he's expecting the father to scold him
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.500]   and tell him all sorts of things,
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.780]   but that's not what the father does.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.180]   The father fully reinstates his son
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.380]   and putting a robe on him,
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.740]   just welcoming back in grace and mercy.
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.180]   So as we're coming right now, there was just a sense
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.300]   that God is just pouring out his grace and mercy.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.660]   And as we're bringing the things,
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.300]   where we're not fully who we want to be,
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.220]   who God is calling us to be,
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.260]   and he's just pouring out his grace
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.740]   and mercy over us right now.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.380]   We say, thank you, Jesus.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.220]   I wanna invite everyone to stand.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:42.460]   And if you long for this renewing,
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.380]   for this transforming work of Jesus in your life,
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.220]   just wanna invite you to stretch out your hands
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.700]   just as a sign of Jesus, I need you.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.620]   I desire for you to work
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.420]   to make me reflect your character more.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.580]   Let me pray over you.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.940]   Jesus, you know all the words
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.860]   that were just spoken right now,
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.540]   all the things that were shared.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.980]   Thank you for you that you meet us with grace and mercy
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.620]   and with your love and your kindness.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.660]   That's what makes it safe to come to you.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:22.220]   And Jesus, I pray for those of us here
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.620]   who've been struggling for a long time with something,
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.420]   or we've lost hope.
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.460]   Jesus, I pray for transformation.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.580]   I pray that, you know, that sin,
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.660]   the power of sin is broken, that chains are broken,
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:41.260]   that you release people into a new and beautiful life
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.860]   that you have saved them and rescued and redeemed them for.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:51.980]   I pray for your beautiful work of sanctification,
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.460]   of making us more holy, of making us more righteous,
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.460]   not because of what we're doing, but because of you.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.620]   And so we bring all this to you,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.980]   and I pray this in your name, Jesus,
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.420]   and all God's people say, amen.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.020]   (gentle music)
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.600]   (gentle music)
