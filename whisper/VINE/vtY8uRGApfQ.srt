1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 As you sit down, say hi to somebody standing around you, sitting near you. Say, "Hey, wow,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,800
 nice to meet you. You're awesome. So good to have you here with us."

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:15,280
 Oh man, I'm so excited. I'm so glad you're here. My name's Andrew. I'm one of the pastors here at

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,680
 the Vine. If you haven't been here for a while or if this is your first time with us, we're so glad

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,040
 you are here. We're completely full today, so if there's a spare seat, you can put your hand up. I

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,200
 know that some people are trying to find a seat still. We're pretty packed. It's great to have

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,240
 you here. If you're online as well, welcome. We have new people visiting online from all over the

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,120
 world every single week that we gather. So if you're tuning in from somewhere around the world,

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,920
 it's great to have you with us. If you're tuning in from Hong Kong, it's great as well to have you

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,360
 here too. Last week, we started a brand new series here at the Vine. Who was here last week? Let me

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,760
 see if you were here last week. Let me see your hands. Okay, a lot of you obviously weren't. Okay,

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,880
 that's a problem. Last week, we started a brand new series called "Will You See?" where I wanted

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,360
 to help us start 2023 with the right perspective, with the right way of seeing what I think God is

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,400
 doing in this critical time of history. One of the things that we said last week is that in critical

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,600
 moments of history, God always does a new thing for his people, a new thing in the world. In fact,

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,560
 you can trace through biblical history the number of times where God steps in and does a new thing

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,920
 in a critical moment of history. I was saying last week that we're in Hong Kong right now in what I

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,200
 think is Hong Kong's most critical moment of its history. Trying to recover from all that the last

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,880
 three years is, trying to find its feet again, work out what its identity is in the world today,

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,800
 how it is in relation with China, all of that unfolding amongst us. This is a critical moment

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,760
 for the city in which we live, and God is doing a new thing. We said last week that that new thing

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:02,480
 is a Greek word. It's the word "kainos." Kainos in Greek means new in terms of never before existed.

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,080
 Not new from something old, as in it's kind of been restored and remade, but completely brand

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,160
 new. Never before existed. That's the kind of new that God does in critical moments of history.

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,800
 We went to Isaiah chapters 40 to 66. In fact, this whole series over the next six weeks,

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,800
 we're going to be sitting in chapters 40 to 66 of Isaiah. But last week we looked at Isaiah 43

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,320
 verses 16 to 21. In there, God declares that he's doing a new thing over a critical time of Israel's

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,360
 history. When they were in exile for 70 years away from Jerusalem, feeling all the pressures of living

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,880
 in exile, in isolation, having a theological crisis, wondering if they're ever going to be

30
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,320
 released to get back to Jerusalem. And God shows up and says, "Behold and see, I'm doing a new thing."

31
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,640
 He says, "Now it springs up." And then he challenges God's people. He says, "Do you see it?

32
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:07,120
 Can you perceive it? Are you able to see the new thing that I'm doing?" And we said last week that

33
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,800
 if God is truly doing a new thing in Hong Kong in 2023, that's the question we've got to ask ourselves.

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,880
 Are we, the people of God, his church in Hong Kong, are we going to be able to see it and perceive it?

35
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,120
 And we spoke last week of two things that stop us from seeing the new thing that God does.

36
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,480
 The first thing is that we think that we must create the new thing ourselves. One of the things that

37
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,400
 stops us allowing God to do the new thing or us seeing God do the new thing is thinking that we

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,800
 have to be the new thing, that we have to do the new thing, that we have to be the ones that create

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,680
 that new thing in the world. And so we put stress and pressure on ourselves to try to think, "Okay,

40
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,800
 I'm in the new year. What resolutions? What goals? What all the things do I need to do so I can be new

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,280
 in the new year?" And God shows up to Israel in a critical moment of the history and said, "It's not

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,200
 about necessarily you being new. I'm doing a new thing. Your role is to perceive it. If you're

43
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,080
 trying to do the new, you will actually miss out on the very new thing that I'm doing." Are you with

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,800
 me? That's the first thing. The second thing we said last week was that one of the main reasons

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:18,240
 why we fail to see the new thing is because we bring old expectations into the new thing God has.

46
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,840
 This is a natural human tendency for all of us to have expectations that help us to interpret the

47
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,080
 present and the future. And our past experiences, all the good, bad, and ugly of our past shapes

48
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,320
 our expectations. You have a good year, you're going to have positive expectations. You have a

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,000
 tough year, often you have negative expectations stepping into the new year. And God says one of

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,880
 the reasons why we fail to see his new thing is because we're actually expecting God to move

51
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,240
 in the ways that we define it based on our past, based on how we've experienced God. Whether good

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,840
 or bad in the past, that creates a box that we put God inside and expect that God is going to act

53
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,360
 like that this year. And God's like, "It's a kainos new thing, completely brand new. And if it's

54
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,880
 completely brand new, your expectations and the box that you've created to put me in is not going

55
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,720
 to actually adequately show you what that new thing is." And so last week we said we need to break our

56
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,520
 boxes as we step into 2023 in order to be able to see the new that God is doing. That was last week

57
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,920
 in three minutes. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Now, if you came last week, you're like,

58
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,880
 "I could have just come this week and got the three minute version. That's so much better."

59
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,640
 No, no. If you weren't here last week, I would encourage you to go back and listen to it if you

60
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:47,520
 can. But as we start week two, here's how we start. We ask ourselves, "Where do we start?"

61
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,080
 Like if God is doing the new and he's calling us to perceive it, then our starting point is,

62
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,400
 "Where do we start in order to position ourselves best to see the new thing he's doing?" In other

63
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,800
 words, what's the posture of my heart that needs to be in the right place at the beginning of the

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,720
 year so that I'm best positioned to see this new thing that he is doing? That's the key question.

65
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,880
 And it's interesting because when God comes to Isaiah and Isaiah speaks over Israel in this

66
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,120
 moment of their exile in Babylon and says, "I'm doing a new thing," immediately Israel goes,

67
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,480
 "We need to get ready. We need to be prepared." And you'll see in chapters 40 to 66 of Isaiah,

68
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,200
 much of Israel trying to prepare themselves for this new thing. And there's one thing that Israel

69
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,280
 always did at the very beginning of a new thing that God is doing. One thing. Do you know what

70
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:54,960
 that one thing is? They fasted. They always started with a fast. And that makes sense

71
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,080
 because fasting for Israel was about preparing themselves for the fresh new thing that God was

72
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,000
 going to do. So they set aside stuff in their lives. They fasted something, put it aside in

73
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
 a sacrifice in order to best be prepared to receive the new thing. So when God says, "I'm

74
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,720
 going to do a new thing," in Isaiah 43, immediately Israel responds by fasting.

75
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:26,640
 But there's an issue. There's always an issue, isn't there? And there's an issue because the way

76
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:38,160
 in which Israel was fasting needed to be changed because God was doing a kainos new thing. And the

77
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,040
 fast that Israel needed to do to prepare themselves also needed to be new. And as we start week two,

78
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,880
 I want to just say this over you from the very beginning, that I honestly believe if you're

79
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,920
 going to see the new thing that God is doing in Hong Kong and in your life this year, it's going

80
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:03,600
 to start with a new perspective. It's going to start with you having a new posture of your heart.

81
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,960
 And I want to ask you to open your heart to that today. We've got a lot of scripture we're going

82
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,520
 to be looking at. We're going to be unpacking a couple of difficult concepts today. I need your

83
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,440
 brain engaged. Can you do that in church? I know you come to church normally and switch off your

84
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:25,600
 brain. Not today. Brain on and ready because I think God wants to change how you approach him

85
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:33,920
 in order that you might see the new. Now this idea of fasting was so critical in Israel. And I want

86
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,760
 to show you, I've got my trusty whiteboard here and you always know things are going to go down

87
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,360
 heavy with the whiteboard. Right? So I'm going to tell you a little bit as we start, I want to help

88
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:51,360
 define the historical way in which Israel fasted. And when they fasted, they did three specific

89
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,920
 things. And those three specific things had three reasons to them. I want to show you that here real

90
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:08,400
 fast. So the first thing is they did not eat or drink for a certain period of time. Okay. They

91
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,480
 did not eat or drink for a certain amount of time. They sacrificed their normal food that they would

92
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,080
 put in their bodies for a certain amount of time. Now here's why they did that. They did it because

93
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:33,680
 they wanted to be sustained. Keyword, sustained by God. By fasting, food or drink, they were saying,

94
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,680
 okay, I want to be sustained by God. I want God to be my sustenance and my support. I'm going to put

95
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,040
 away the stuff that I would normally feed my body with. And I'm going to ask God to feed me by his

96
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,920
 spirit, right? By his sustenance. It was a way of them saying, God, I want you and you only. So

97
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,640
 that's the first thing. Here's the second thing they did. This one, I don't recommend to you.

98
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:05,120
 They got naked. Well, it's me being a bit facetious. Actually, they put on a sackcloth

99
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:13,040
 and they took off their shoes. Okay. When they fasted, they put on a sackcloth. Now,

100
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,920
 what is that? A sackcloth was like a undergarment. Okay. They would take off their normal clothes.

101
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,240
 They would put on an undergarment. They would remove their shoes. Why were they doing this?

102
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,240
 This was a symbolic way for them to say, we're in mourning. You might know from scripture,

103
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,520
 when they put sackcloths on and put ashes on their head, it was always a symbol, wasn't it?

104
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,600
 Of mourning. It was a symbol of giving their lives to a mourning or a grieving period. So what they're

105
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,160
 trying to do by turning themselves naked, by putting on the sackcloth, what they were saying

106
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,320
 is we're in a time of mourning and we're going to afflict ourselves. We're going to self-afflict.

107
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,120
 Yeah. Afflict ourselves so that we are actually in a position of humility before God. Take off

108
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,040
 my clothes, put on my sackcloth, take my shoes off. Oh, woe is me. I'm mourning. I'm trying to

109
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,840
 put myself in this humble posture before the Lord in order that God would see my affliction

110
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:17,360
 and listen to my prayer. Still okay? Everybody with us? All right, good. Here's the third thing

111
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:25,600
 they did. The third thing was they bowed their head. They actually, literally on the day of

112
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,720
 their fast, would keep their head down on the ground. They would do this because they were

113
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,600
 averting their eyes to the flesh around them, to the people around them. And they wanted to do that

114
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,360
 because they were specifically trying, and this is the key thing here, they were trying to sort of

115
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,560
 shut out the world. Why were they trying to shut out the world? They were trying to get rid of all

116
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,880
 of the distractions of life. Fasting was about not eating so God could sustain me. It was about

117
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,920
 putting on a sackcloth, taking off my shoes so that I could show myself afflicted before the Lord.

118
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,400
 And it was also then about this reality of kind of reaching out to God and saying, "Hey God,

119
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,560
 would you come and respond to me? Would you move in this way where I bow my head, I shut out the

120
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,360
 world, I can't be distracted by any of those nasty things out there in the world. If I can keep away

121
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,480
 from the world, I can stay focused on God and God could respond to my prayer." Are you with me still?

122
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,520
 Some of you right now are doing your 21-day fast. We're doing a 21-day fast here at the Vine. A lot

123
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,400
 of you are fasting social media. That's a way of bowing your head, trying to put aside the

124
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,680
 distractions of the world for a certain period of time so you can focus on God. Now here's the

125
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,520
 absolute kicker to all of this. The whole reason why they did these three very specific things

126
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:50,240
 was so that they could achieve two purposes. The first was to gain God's attention.

127
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,640
 You should be making notes, it's okay if you're not, but I'm going to shame you. No, just kidding.

128
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,000
 So the first was to gain God's attention. They wanted to get God to turn his mind and his heart

129
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 towards them. The second thing was to receive, keyword, God's justice. So they fasted

130
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,400
 to gain God's attention, to receive God's justice. In other words,

131
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,200
 they were like, "Hey, I'm going to sacrifice all this stuff so God, you would look upon me. You

132
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,960
 would see me so that you would understand my affliction. You would understand my humility

133
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,640
 before you. And in all of that, I would get your attention and your attention would be for my

134
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:43,520
 justice, to change the thing that I'm praying for, to come into my life and fix my situation,

135
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,800
 whatever it is that's on my heart, whatever's the reason why I'm fasting, I'm doing these things in

136
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,960
 order to gain your attention and to get your justice. Is that making sense to you so far?

137
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:00,640
 Okay, so when God says, "I'm going to do a new thing," Israel responds with the starting point

138
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:10,080
 of a fast and God shows up and says, "You've got it all wrong." Actually, it's actually

139
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,640
 not really about all of this. There's actually a new way to fast. There's actually a new way to

140
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,640
 start. And in fact, if you want to posture your heart for what it is that I'm doing in the world,

141
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,400
 the kainos new, then there's a new position, a new posture. And God begins to open up in Isaiah

142
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,360
 chapter 58, what the new posture is. And let me tell you before we open it, it's not easy.

143
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,920
 But if we're hungry, if we really want to see God do something new in our city,

144
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,040
 if we really love Hong Kong and love the people of our city, then what we're about to unpack from

145
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:50,640
 Isaiah 58 really means something. And I want to challenge you up front to say, "I'm going to commit

146
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:58,880
 to this, even if this is going to cost me something." Because guess what? Fasting is all about

147
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,520
 sacrifice. Are you ready? We're going to open scripture, Isaiah 58, starting in verse one.

148
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:12,800
 Here's how God starts. "Shout it aloud. Do not hold back. Raise your voice like a trumpet.

149
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,480
 Declare to my people their rebellion and to the house of Jacob, their sins."

150
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:27,840
 God starts by saying, "You are in sin." The way I'm... God's like, "I'm just about to speak to you

151
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,720
 for a whole chapter about fasting, all the things that you're doing right now, all the stuff that

152
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,640
 you do religiously, that you do piously, that you think you're doing. I'm going to start with that,

153
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,120
 but I'm starting from the perspective that you actually are in sin from the very beginning."

154
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,440
 In other words, your heart is not in the right place. You're fasting, but your heart is not

155
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,240
 in the right posture. You're not starting from the right place. And God's basically going to say,

156
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:56,080
 "Therefore, you're blind." Even if you're doing all of what you think are the right actions,

157
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:04,320
 you can do the right religious actions and still be blind. Because it's not actually about what

158
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,400
 you're physically doing. It's about where your heart is starting from. What's the posture of

159
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,520
 your heart and how is your heart at work? God is saying that's what's about to really make the

160
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,320
 difference. Notice what he says in verse 2. He says, "For day after day, they seek me out." He's

161
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,240
 speaking about Israel. "They seek me out. They seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a

162
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,280
 nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God. They ask me for just

163
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,320
 decisions, and they seem eager for God to draw near." Now, all of that sounds pretty good.

164
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,560
 I mean, if you were to say to me, "What kind of community at the vine do you want, Andrew?" I would

165
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,880
 say, "Well, I would love us day to day to seek God out. I would love us to be eager to know God's

166
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,920
 ways. I would love us to seek for God's justice and his just decisions. And I would be awesome

167
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,200
 if we all wanted to draw near to God. I mean, those things are amazing." I mean, it's like

168
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:05,680
 that's a list of a great church community. God says, "You're doing all of this, but you're in sin."

169
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,160
 In fact, he says in the middle of the verse, he says, "They do this as if they were a nation

170
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,080
 that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God." In other words, all the

171
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:22,320
 religious activity is a bit of a sham. Even though it might be right activity, because it's done from

172
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:29,680
 the wrong posture, it's actually resulting in something that God does not honor. And at the

173
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,000
 start of the year, that's sobering for all of us. I mean, that should ask us all some big questions.

174
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,280
 I know it asks me some big questions. I'm a pastor of a church, and I'm thinking like, "Are the things

175
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,600
 that I go through on a daily basis, on a weekly basis?" When I stand before all of you on a Sunday,

176
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,120
 I have to ask myself, "Is this coming from an authentic place of worship of God, where my heart

177
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:01,760
 is in the right place, or am I doing something as a show? Am I performing before you, or am I preaching

178
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,520
 to you?" I have to ask myself that constantly, because I know the temptation of my flesh.

179
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,320
 I know how I can perform before you

180
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,960
 and get away with it. And so I have to constantly say to myself, "Is this just religious activity,

181
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:28,160
 or is this life-giving?" And I think you need to ask yourself that question.

182
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,280
 I think at the beginning of the year, what a great time to ask that question.

183
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,880
 Am I coming to church every Sunday because it's just habit? Am I coming because it's

184
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:45,680
 religious activity for me? Or is my heart really yearning day-to-day to see God? Is my heart

185
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:53,520
 really wanting His justice? Is my heart really wanting to go deeper with Him? Do I really want

186
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,800
 Jesus to be nearer me? That's a really dangerous prayer. If you really want Jesus to be near to you,

187
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:06,240
 be careful, because life's going to get interesting. Whenever God comes nearer to me,

188
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,040
 He always challenges me to change something in my life. Sometimes I'm like, "God, just stay where

189
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,920
 you are." We start the year, we have to ask ourselves these tough, hard questions. God's

190
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,200
 asking Israel because He's got something He wants to encourage them with, whilst challenging them.

191
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,760
 Notice what He does next in verse 3. "Why have we fasted?" they say. This is Israel's voice.

192
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,760
 "And you have not seen it. Why have we humbled ourselves and you have not noticed?" This is

193
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:45,200
 Israel's honest cry before God. They're like, "God, you're distant. God, we're doing all of this

194
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,600
 stuff for you. Why are we doing all of this and you don't seem to answer our prayers? Why are we

195
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,000
 doing all of this, but you're not showing us your attention and we don't seem to have your justice?

196
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,480
 God, what's happening? Why are we going through all this activity and you don't seem to be

197
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,440
 responding?" It's interesting, right? God knows why He's not responding, because their heart isn't in

198
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,680
 the right place. And the reason why their heart's not in the right place is because they're starting

199
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:17,920
 from the perspective of, "Look what I do for you. Look how I'm earning your favor, God. I'm working

200
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,840
 my butt off so that you would answer my prayer and you're not answering it. That doesn't seem fair.

201
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:31,120
 You're not being just to me." I wonder if you've ever felt like that. I know I've felt like that

202
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,920
 many times. Why is God distant? Why is He not answering me? Doesn't He see how many times I

203
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,480
 preach my heart out? Doesn't He see what I do? Doesn't He experience what I experience? Does

204
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,440
 He not know what's happening at the vine? Come on, God, why are you not replying to my prayers?

205
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:53,520
 What God's trying to do here, using this rhetorical moment in this passage, is He's trying

206
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:02,080
 to highlight the attitude of Israel. Here's their attitude. "We're a victim, God. We're victims here.

207
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,080
 We're victims. Can't you see our pain and our struggle? We need you to respond to us, God.

208
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:16,480
 We're the ones who have been wronged, God. You have wronged us, God. We're in exile for 70 years, God.

209
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,920
 Why are we still here? You have not acted on our behalf." Their mindset, their mentality is

210
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:30,400
 victimhood. "I'm a victim here, and God, I'm doing all of this stuff so that you would change me from

211
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,800
 a victim to a victor. And I'm a victim." And God's looking down on Israel, and He's saying, "You

212
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:43,760
 haven't got it, have you? Because you think you're a victim, which means that you have no concept

213
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,720
 that it was actually your own sin that led you into exile. You're blaming me still for the very

214
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,040
 reason why you are where you are. You guys screwed up. There was idol worship. There was all this

215
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,320
 stuff happening in you, and these things took place to respond to the reality of what was in

216
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,360
 your heart. And now, 70 years later, you're still going, 'Oh, I'm the victim. I'm the victim. I'm the

217
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,280
 one who's been wronged.'" And God's like, "Hang on a second. You want to know who the real victims are

218
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,760
 here? You want to know who really has been wronged? You want to know who's really suffering in this

219
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:34,080
 world? Let me show you." Yet on the day of your fasting, you just do as you please, and you exploit

220
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,400
 all your workers. Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife, and in striking each other with wicked

221
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:48,560
 fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high. "Is this the kind

222
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:56,240
 of fast that I've chosen? Only for one day for a person to humble themselves?" God says. "Is it only

223
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:05,360
 for bowing one's head like a reed or for lying in sackcloth and ashes? Is that what I call a fast,

224
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,080
 a day acceptable to the Lord?" God goes right to the heart of it here. And he says, "Here's the

225
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,080
 issue that I have with everything that you're doing here in your fast. You think you're a victim

226
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,880
 when actually you, on the day of your fast, have become victimizers. You're exploiting your workers.

227
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,400
 You're treating people around you unfairly. You're getting into fights with everybody, and you're

228
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,600
 supposed to be giving your heart to me. You're supposed to be fasting and preparing yourself for

229
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,560
 the new thing I'm about to do. You're not even treating your neighbor as I've called you to treat

230
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:49,280
 your neighbor." And God's like, "Don't you realize what's happening here? When you are stuck in a

231
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:56,720
 victim mentality, you're always going to be on, or always thinking that you need to be on, the

232
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,560
 receiving end of life rather than the giving end of life." See, this is what happens when you think

233
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:09,040
 yourself always as a victim. You always then need other people to do stuff for you. And Israel got

234
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,800
 themselves so camped in this idea that they're victims of something, that they're now exploiting

235
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,560
 the people around them and asking God to come and give them justice. When God's like, "You want to

236
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,960
 know who the people are that really need justice? It's not you. The people who really need justice

237
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,440
 here are the ones that you're exploiting, the ones that you're downtrodden, the ones that you're not

238
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,720
 giving fair wages to, the ones that you're actually not giving the right rights to. Those are the

239
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,160
 people that my heart is turned for. You want to know what fasting looks like? Fasting looks like

240
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:50,160
 doing something for them. Because if you stay in your current concept of what you think it is to

241
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,760
 get my attention and to get my justice, if you think it's all about me, me, me, me, when my heart

242
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,560
 is about everybody else out there in the world who desperately needs my attention and my love

243
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:07,520
 and my gospel and my freeing and my release out of oppression, man, that's where the fast really happens.

244
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:16,000
 It's very challenging because God says something here which just blows my mind. He says in verse 4,

245
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:24,240
 "You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high."

246
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:32,480
 Just pause on that for a second. God's saying you cannot ever get what you want to get

247
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:40,720
 and fast the way you are, exploiting your workers, treating people around you in your city

248
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,000
 like they're secondary citizens. You cannot do that and expect me to respond to you. That's some

249
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,600
 big words. God's trying to shake Israel's perception of how they see themselves and see the world.

250
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,040
 If I was to rephrase this in a way that would help us think about our context in Hong Kong,

251
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,680
 I would say it like this. God would say, "You cannot expect me or you cannot expect to

252
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:13,280
 to keep the current state of your life, to approach me in the way that you're currently approaching me

253
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,120
 and expect to see the new thing that I'm doing. You can't expect to see that new thing from the

254
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,600
 current posture of your heart. Your heart has to change in order for you to see the very new thing

255
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:36,800
 I'm about to do." And I wonder whether if we're really honest with ourselves that we would

256
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:46,240
 kind of connect to this in a deep way. How am I actually living my life? What is my posture

257
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:56,160
 towards God? Is my primary relationship with God what he can do for me? Do I relate to God in such

258
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:03,120
 a way where I'm often the victim in our relationship? Are these some of the ways in which as I step into

259
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,440
 2023, that's the way I'm going to be communicating with God? That's the way I'm going to be seeing

260
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,600
 him from a posture of victimhood, from a posture of, "Well, it's all about me." When God is looking

261
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:22,000
 over Hong Kong and saying, "There's so much injustice happening here. There's so much

262
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,720
 of the poor and the vulnerable and the hurting and the mistreated that I'm on behalf of and I have a

263
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:41,440
 sleeping church." Will the church open their eyes to see the very thing that God is actually doing

264
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,080
 here? It doesn't mean that he doesn't care about your needs. It doesn't mean that he doesn't want

265
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,800
 to actually change you and help you, of course. In fact, we're going to see in a little moment

266
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:58,560
 that he does that. But the starting point of our heart, our approach and posture to him,

267
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,880
 must be from a new perspective. What is that new perspective? Well, let me show you some of the

268
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,280
 ways that God breaks this down. Is this helpful for some people so far? All right, here we go.

269
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:15,760
 Look at verse six. "Is this not then the kind of fasting that I have chosen? To lose the chains of

270
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:24,000
 injustice, to untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? Is it not

271
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,480
 to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter, when you see the

272
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,720
 naked, to clothe him and not turn away from your own flesh and blood?" God shows up and says, "Let

273
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,920
 me show you what the fast actually looks like. Let me show you what the posture of the heart

274
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,160
 actually does." And he takes all of the three things that Israel were currently doing and he

275
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:54,960
 inverts every single one of them. He says, "Here's what the real fast looks like. Rather than you

276
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,800
 not eating and drinking, you're to feed those who can't eat and drink."

277
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:08,000
 Oh, that's a different kind of 21-day fast. "Rather than you setting aside your own resources

278
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,360
 so that you yourself can feel hungry and in that think you're going to be closer to me,

279
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,560
 what about if you took the resources that you were thinking of setting aside and actually just use

280
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,680
 those resources to actually feed the people that are really hungry? What if you actually tried to

281
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:34,000
 serve the poor people around you?" You see, the fast that God chooses is not us religiously trying

282
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,960
 to make ourselves more hungry and afflicted, but to actually make the poor less hungry and afflicted.

283
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,200
 That's the fast. That's the attitude. That's the starting point of the heart.

284
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,160
 God says, "What are you doing about the starving people in your neighborhood? What are you doing

285
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,080
 about the poor in Hong Kong? What are you doing about those that don't have enough to put food

286
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,000
 on their tables? What are you doing for the refugee families, for asylum seekers in the city?

287
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,920
 What are you doing for those who are domestic workers mistreated here? What are you doing for

288
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,960
 the many poor people in the city who actually can't afford or their parents are working crazy jobs

289
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,000
 24 hours just to put some food on the table and you have an abundance of resource and you're just

290
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,800
 going to put that resource to one side so you feel hungry?" God says, "Wake up. Use those resources

291
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:32,720
 so that the poor are no longer hungry." That's a fast. He then says, "And when you see naked people,

292
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,600
 when you see the really naked people, the ones that can't afford clothes and stuff,

293
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,560
 you should use your resources to actually clothe them. You should actually bless them. You should

294
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,160
 actually take what you've got, the abundance that you've been given, and use it to use. Don't take

295
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,920
 your clothes off and put some sackcloth on and try to symbolize some mourning. Come on, wake up.

296
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,120
 You're not mourning. They are in trouble. Get up, get your clothes and clothe them," he says.

297
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:04,640
 And what about bowing our heads? Oh yeah. What about turning away from the world? God says, "No,

298
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:11,040
 do not ignore," he says here, "your own flesh and blood, the human beings around you, the poor and

299
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,480
 the vulnerable and the naked and the hurting, those that are being mistreated by human rights,

300
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,040
 those that don't feel like they're equal in the eyes of everybody else in the city. Those ones

301
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,280
 we should be turning our eyes towards. Those ones we should be reaching out and loving. Those ones

302
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,360
 we should be working hard to make their lives better. We shouldn't be turning away. We should

303
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:36,880
 be turning towards." The fast that God chooses is not to turn your eyes away from the world,

304
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,040
 but to turn your full attention to the injustices being suffered by others in the world.

305
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,800
 Now that's really a fast, God says. That will really show that your heart is in the right place,

306
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:58,080
 that you're willing to do the work, the sacrifice. Remember, fasting is about sacrifice,

307
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:08,320
 the sacrifice of truly serving those that need it the most. Oh man. And it gets even better.

308
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,280
 Are you ready for even better? Because that's already hard enough work. Gets even better than

309
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:20,320
 that. God, in setting up this new fast, he creates basically three buckets in which he wants his

310
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:28,480
 people to respond. The first is to bring freedom. Bring freedom. God's people should be setting

311
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,840
 people free, not burdening them. And he uses all these languages, "Untie the yoke, loosen the

312
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,320
 chains, break the bonds." He's saying, "Look, there are people oppressed in this world. There

313
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,880
 are people held back. There are people with chains of slavery around them, whether that's physical,

314
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,120
 whether that's metaphorical, emotional, mental, whatever it might be. There are people that are

315
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,640
 struggling in this world under oppression, and the church should rise up and say, 'We're on behalf of

316
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,280
 freedom. We're going to break some chains, loose some cords. We're going to set some people free

317
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,160
 in the name of Jesus, because that's what we've been called to do.'" And he doesn't say this. Note

318
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,720
 this, very important. He doesn't say, "Just cease oppressing people." That would be important,

319
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,040
 but he doesn't say, "Just stop an activity." The words he uses here are proactive words. "Untie

320
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,960
 the cords, break the chains." In other words, it's not just good enough to say, "I'm no longer going

321
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,680
 to oppress people. I now need to be a part of the solution. I need now to rise up and say,

322
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,240
 'What is it that I can do to actually make just distribution of resources better in my city? How

323
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,280
 do I actually stand against systemic injustices that we see in various areas of our city? What

324
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,760
 can I proactively do to not just stop oppression myself, but actually be an active engagement

325
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,800
 member? If I'm going to be righteous and justice-minded in Hong Kong, then I need to be

326
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:56,800
 proactively working on behalf of setting people free." And that involves sharing the gospel.

327
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,640
 That involves bringing the good news of Jesus to people. It involves preaching and teaching

328
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,920
 and showing people a new way of life so that they can receive salvation in Jesus. And it also

329
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:14,400
 involves standing against people who are trafficking people into our city. It also involves

330
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,760
 speaking about the systemic issues of gender inequality in our systems and structures in our

331
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,360
 city. It also involves us being proactive and thinking about what are the ways in which God's

332
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:32,320
 kingdom can be seen in the fullness that it wants to be seen here in Hong Kong. That, my friends,

333
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:40,160
 is fasting. Are you with me so far? Then, number two, we meet the needs. Because when you free

334
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,480
 somebody, you've got to meet their needs. Because when somebody is free, they're often at a point

335
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,200
 where they have nothing. "I've been in slavery. I've been in bondage. I've been set free. Now we

336
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,480
 need to meet their needs." And we've already looked at these things, things like feeding the hungry,

337
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,560
 clothing the poor, providing shelter for the homeless. These are the things that we do to

338
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,960
 help people meet their needs. Now, the only reason we can bring freedom and help people with their

339
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,240
 needs is by the third important thing, shifting our attitudes. Oh, man. When God says, "Do not

340
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,720
 forsake the young," the flesh amongst you, the people of your own flesh and blood, when he says,

341
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,240
 "Do not forsake them," that word actually in Hebrew means more like, "Do not hide from them."

342
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:27,280
 It actually brings echoes of Genesis 1 and 2 and 3, where Adam and Eve hide from God because of

343
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,920
 their shame. And it's actually challenging Christians that so often we hide from people,

344
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,440
 and rather than help them, we judge. In fact, God laid this on. We haven't got time to look at it,

345
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,720
 but God laid this on in the same chapter. It says, "Stop wagging your finger at people.

346
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,480
 Stop judging people, Christians. Your role is not to judge people." That's actually Jesus' role.

347
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:56,720
 He's the judge of the world. God's saying, "No wagging of your finger. Your heart, your posture,

348
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,480
 is to shift an attitude inside of you and say, 'What is it that they're feeling? What is it that

349
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,520
 they're going through? What is it that is broken in them? What compassion, Lord? Give me more

350
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,320
 compassion. Give me more grace. Give me more mercy. Help me to see them as you see them,

351
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,320
 because I'm not to shut my eyes from them. I'm to actually actively engage my life towards them

352
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,400
 with the gospel and the love of Jesus Christ. That's what I'm called to do.

353
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:32,400
 Help me, Lord. Do that." Now, here's a quick thing. Look at this one more time on the screen.

354
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,920
 This is not a job description that God is calling you to do so you can earn favor,

355
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,560
 so that God can give you his attention and give you justice.

356
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,760
 And in our culture and society, we look at a list like that, we take a photo of it,

357
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,360
 and we're like, "I'm going to do this. It's a job description. Pastor Andrew asked me to do it.

358
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,840
 I will do it. Be more just." This is not a job description. Let me tell you what this is.

359
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:07,520
 This is like a doctor's prescription. In other words, this is God's suggestion

360
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:16,880
 of how Israel could heal themselves. I had an age spot on my face. I'm at an age now where I get age

361
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,400
 spots. And I got an age spot on my face the other day, the other week, months ago, actually. And it

362
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,800
 went funny. It went a weird color. And I went to a dermatologist and he looked at it. He's like, "Oh,

363
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,800
 we need to get rid of that." So I went back in for surgery. We had it tested. It wasn't cancerous,

364
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,200
 praise God, but we had to go through all of that. Then he gave me medicine. And he said, "Here's

365
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:42,960
 your medicine. If you take this, if you apply the cream, then you will be healed." And God shifts

366
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,600
 the focus here, having just said, "Here's what I need you to do." He then gives him an if and then.

367
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,880
 He just said, "If you feed the hungry, if you do this, if you clothe this, then," in verses 8 and

368
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,680
 9, he says this, "then your light will break forth like the dawn and your healing will quickly

369
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,280
 appear. Then your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the Lord will be your rear

370
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:13,120
 guard. Then you will call," notice this, "then you will call and the Lord will answer you. You will

371
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:19,440
 cry for help and he will say, 'Here I am.'" In other words, the very things that you wanted out of the

372
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,160
 original fast, I'm going to come through for you and I'm going to do. But it's going to come to you,

373
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,240
 not by doing something like this, because you're putting yourself in a victim mentality space.

374
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,680
 It's going to come as you serve and give yourself wholeheartedly to those around you. As you love

375
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:40,080
 your neighbor, as you love yourself, as you do all of that, then I will heal you. Remember, God starts

376
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:46,800
 this back in verse 1 to say, "You're in sin and the healing is needed." We all need some healing

377
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,000
 in the posture of our heart towards God as we start this new year. And God's saying, "Here's the

378
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,640
 if and then." Like a doctor, "If you take this cream, Andrew, you will be healed. If you fast this way,

379
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:07,920
 then your healing will quickly appear." And God is saying all of this to make a really important

380
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,720
 final point. Can you handle a final point? He's saying all of this, "I am doing a new thing.

381
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,680
 It's already at work. Can you not perceive it? Here's how you start in your heart and your posture.

382
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,960
 Not by focusing in on yourself and thinking that you're the one that needs fixing. Here's how you

383
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,320
 discover the new thing I am doing. Go to the very people that you've been avoiding.

384
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:44,480
 Go to the broken, the poor, the vulnerable, the hurting, the very people that you've been exploiting.

385
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:53,120
 Go to them and do the opposite of what you were doing. Clove them, feed them, love them.

386
00:39:53,120 --> 00:40:01,920
 Don't judge them. Give them compassion and grace. Celebrate them. Share the gospel with them. Do

387
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,800
 that because the new thing I'm doing is going to be discovered in the very people that you've

388
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:21,600
 been avoiding." Big words from God to Israel. Big words from God to the vine at the start of 2023.

389
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:29,600
 That maybe we'll be able to see something that we've never seen of God ever before when we look

390
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:38,000
 into the eyes of the poor, the eyes of the mistreated, the vulnerable amongst us. And we say,

391
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,760
 "I don't have all the solutions. I don't have all the answers. I don't even know maybe how to respond."

392
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:53,120
 But I know that through you, Lord, I can just do one simple thing to take your justice, not for me,

393
00:40:53,120 --> 00:41:02,240
 but for them. And in bringing them justice, I might come to know God like I've never known him before.

394
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,320
 God finishes all of this with one final statement in verse 12. He says, "Your people will rebuild

395
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:14,560
 the ancient ruins. You will raise up the age-old foundations. You will be called repairer of broken

396
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,000
 walls and restorer of streets with dwellings." God says, "Here's what will happen when you do this.

397
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,320
 When you shift your heart, when you start from a new posture, when you don't make it about you as

398
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,560
 the victim, when you think about everybody else around you, when you give your life to serve the

399
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,400
 vulnerable and the poor and the hurting and those that are really under injustice, here's what I

400
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:41,360
 will end up calling you. You will be called repairers of broken walls and restorers of streets

401
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,240
 with dwellings." I love this. He speaks about the city. He's like, "If you do this in people,

402
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,200
 I will restore your city. I will make it a better place. It'll be a greater, better place. It'll be

403
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,240
 felt more with my kingdom than ever before. Your role," he's saying to Israel, "is to be people

404
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:03,280
 that I call restorer of broken walls, repairers of streets for dwellings." Every single time you

405
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,680
 and I focus our hearts on wanting to see the gospel come into our city more, of wanting to

406
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:14,320
 see God's heart for justice in our city more, essentially what we're doing is we're repairing

407
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:22,160
 the broken walls of people. The ruins that are in people, that are even in you and I, we're working

408
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,200
 with the Holy Spirit to see those things repaired. We're ensuring that the streets of our city are

409
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,000
 better places to live in when we're giving of our life to those who need it the most.

410
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:45,360
 God is the architect in the restoring of a city. He is the architect and the one who makes things

411
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,560
 new. Our role is to be his construction workers, the ones that roll up our sleeve and

412
00:42:51,360 --> 00:43:02,480
 get to the job. We need to take off the hat that we wear when we're victims and put on a hard hat

413
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:10,080
 of God's gospel and justice in our city. There and only there will we see the new thing

414
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,240
 that he's doing. Can I pray for you? Let's pray.

415
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:24,560
 Father, I'm so grateful for all the people here in this room, for the men and women that are online

416
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:33,280
 right now, for those that are listening in this moment. Father, we're grateful for your spirit,

417
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,400
 grateful for your work of your presence in our lives.

418
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,240
 And Father, we come,

419
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,000
 Lord, just wanting to be reframed by your spirit today, coming so that we can approach the start

420
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,720
 of 2023 with the right heart, the right mindset. Lord, we do need a new fast. It's not just Israel

421
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,880
 that was getting things wrong. Lord, we recognize in our own approach to you at times,

422
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,720
 we do things with the wrong heart, the wrong starting point.

423
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,800
 And again, it's not that you don't care, Lord, for our needs, you do.

424
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,920
 It's not that you don't look down on us and wanting to help us and restore us. You do, of course.

425
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,400
 But so often it's easy for us to have that thought and that mind that our relationship

426
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,440
 with you is primarily about what you'll do for us. Lord, would you forgive us?

427
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,280
 Lord, we're grateful that your heart is turned towards us, that you will do

428
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,240
 mighty things for us. But Lord, our starting point is not primarily what you can do for us.

429
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:47,280
 Our starting point is the mission that you've given us, to be your hands and feet in the world

430
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:55,120
 around us. Lord, we pray that you would indeed send to us. I purposely did not tell you in this

431
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,440
 message what you should do. I didn't give you three tips on social justice in Hong Kong in 2023,

432
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,440
 because this message is about your own heart and it's about your own response.

433
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,360
 And it's about you considering what it is that God is calling you to do.

434
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,880
 It will look different for every single person in this room, but there are people in your life

435
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,600
 right now, people in your sphere of influence that are in need, whether that's emotional,

436
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:33,200
 social, financial. There are people that you know who are broken inside, who need their own walls

437
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:43,040
 restored. We all have people in our lives like that. And so the prayer today is for you to come

438
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:50,800
 before the Lord and say, God, show me the next simple thing I can do to be somebody more of

439
00:45:50,800 --> 00:46:00,160
 justice in my city, so that I can fast in this way, so that I can sacrifice in this way, not

440
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,680
 for what you will do for me, God, but for what you will do for them.

441
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:13,680
 And in that heart and that attitude, you will see God like you've never seen him before.

442
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:20,800
 The new thing that he's doing right here now will become a revelation to you

443
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:28,880
 as you seek and serve the lost. Lord, I pray that that would be our passion as a church.

444
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,320
 I pray that you would use your spirit upon us and through us,

445
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:38,560
 and that it would be for your glory. In Jesus' name.
