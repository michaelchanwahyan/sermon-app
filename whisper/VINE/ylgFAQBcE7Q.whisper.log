[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   Yeah, well when I graduated from university, the first two years out of
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.960]   university, I had two different jobs and I didn't know really what I wanted to do.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.600]   I didn't know who I wanted to be and I didn't know really where I was heading
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.920]   and I just felt like my life was drifting but I didn't know what to
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.200]   do about it. And if somebody would have asked me at that point in time, "How is
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.400]   God at work in your life right now at this moment?" which I think is a good
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.320]   question, but at that time I would have said, "I have no idea. I don't know." As a matter
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.120]   of fact, it actually even felt like that God is absent, that nothing special,
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.360]   particular seems to be happening. And perhaps some of you are feeling that
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.920]   same way or you would answer that question the same way if I were to ask
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.720]   you, "What is God doing in your life right now?" I don't know. Maybe we
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.520]   just have our weekly routine where we're just going through the motions and it
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.600]   always seems to be the same kind of thing and we're just like, "I don't know
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.880]   what God is doing in that or where God is in that." Maybe you actually are going
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.080]   through a difficult season and it certainly doesn't feel like God is at
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.880]   work in this difficult season. And so you're also wondering, "Where
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.680]   is God in that or is God in that at all?" And so I want to, today with you, through
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.280]   this message, I want to explore a couple of questions. The first one is, "Does God
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.360]   work in our lives even when we don't see it happening?" Is God at work in those
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.680]   moments that just seem mundane or even where there's pain and struggle even if
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.960]   we can't see it? And is God weaving a story together that we cannot see yet? Is
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.400]   there a deeper meaning that perhaps God's going to bring out of the mundane
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.160]   or even the difficult and the suffering that one day we get to see? And then of
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.560]   course the question is, "How do we see it? How do we know or how can we know what
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.520]   God is doing? How do we actually find that out?" So that's what I want to
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.600]   explore with you today. We are in the final sermon of our sermons here, the
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.520]   story of Joseph. I don't know about you, I've been enjoying it thoroughly. Anyone
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:41.960]   else? Yes? Okay, good. Thank you. Front row, come on. No, even for myself, whether it's
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.240]   been in preparing or even listening to others preach, God has spoken to me and I
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.280]   trust that God has been speaking to you through his Word, by Spirit, you know,
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.760]   through the community. And so it's been an incredible journey. Now let me set the
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.400]   context for us for today's message. So the last two weeks we had Pastor Justin
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.160]   and we had Pastor John and they talked about forgiveness and reconciliation,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.840]   a process of working through forgiving someone. And then Pastor John talked
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.520]   about reconciliation and repentance and how Joseph devised these tests
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.440]   for his brothers to see whether or not they really could reconcile. And they
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.080]   passed the test with flying colors because Judah and his brothers, they
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.480]   didn't just throw Benjamin under the bus, they actually went back to Pharaoh with
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.240]   Benjamin when he was accused of stealing his silver cup and they showed
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.520]   that there was a repentance of their sin in their hearts for what they had done.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.720]   And then Judah even offered himself as a substitute to take the place of Benjamin
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.200]   when he was supposed to be enslaved, which was quite different than what he
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.480]   did to Joseph all these years earlier where they had sold him into slavery. Now
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.680]   he was offering himself. So it was amazing. So Joseph was finally at this
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.120]   point where he felt like he could show them the forgiveness, he could reconcile with
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.720]   them, the relationship could be restored, and he makes himself known and that's
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.840]   where we're gonna pick up the story. So in Genesis, sorry, Genesis 45 verse 1 it
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.120]   says this, "Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.000]   attendants and he cried out, 'Make everyone leave my presence!' So there was no one
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.880]   with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers and he wept so loudly
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.040]   that the Egyptians heard him and Pharaoh's household heard about it.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.640]   Joseph said to his brothers, 'I am Joseph! Is my father still living?' But his
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.960]   brothers were not able to answer him because they were terrified at his
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:12.320]   presence." Now this is a highly emotional moment. Joseph didn't know if this
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.240]   moment would ever come in his life. But now he could see that he
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.720]   could restore this relationship, there could be reconciliation, and so he makes
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:33.400]   himself known to his brothers. "I am Joseph!" Now what's amazing with this
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:40.080]   is before he's been actually speaking with an interpreter. So he's not speaking
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:48.640]   Hebrew but now he's saying in Hebrew, "I am Joseph! Is my father still living?" And I
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.240]   also love that after revealing his identity, he right away
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.400]   wants to know what's going on with his father and that just shows how important
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.880]   his family is to him. I think we can relate to this because these
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.080]   matters when it comes to reconciliation and forgiveness. It's
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.480]   just so important to us. But I don't think that his brother heard that part,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.600]   "Is my father still living?" I think they were just so shocked by Joseph suddenly
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   who's been working through an interpreter, suddenly speaking Hebrew and
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:27.760]   saying, "I am Joseph!" That anything after that they couldn't hear. And let's put
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.960]   ourselves in the shoes of Joseph's brothers. They sold Joseph into slavery. I
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:42.360]   mean that was a heinous thing. They thought he was dead. They didn't think he
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.720]   was alive anymore, let alone did they think they would ever cross his path. And
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:55.960]   now they're standing here in front of the Prime Minister of Egypt and he
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:03.160]   reveals himself to be their brother. Now they're fully at the mercy of him. He has
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.680]   so much power, so much authority and they don't know that he's had these tests and
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.000]   that his intention is to reconcile. They don't know that at this point in time. So
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.560]   we were told that they are terrified. And I think we can understand why because
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:28.600]   they're thinking, "Oh no, oh no, this is it." But let's see how things continue.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:39.200]   Verse 4, "Then Joseph said to his brothers, 'Come close to me.'" When they...
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:52.200]   Okay, perfect timing. You can say a quick prayer that my cough doesn't keep coming
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.720]   otherwise I'm going to keep coughing this whole time. Thank you Chapman. So let's
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.600]   continue in verse 4. "Then Joseph said to his brothers, 'Come close to me.' When they
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.080]   had done so, he said, 'I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt. And
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.600]   now do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.840]   here because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. For two years
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.200]   now there has been famine in the land and for the next five years there will
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.360]   be no plowing and reaping. But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:41.440]   remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So then it was
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:49.240]   not you who sent me here but God. He made me to Pharaoh, Lord of his... He made me
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.360]   father to Pharaoh, Lord of his entire household and ruler of all of Egypt. Now
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.080]   hurry back to my father and say to him, 'This is what your son Joseph says. God
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.960]   made me Lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don't delay. You shall live in the
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:12.520]   region of Goshen and be near me. You, your children and grandchildren, your flocks
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:19.040]   and herds and all you have, I will provide for you there because five years
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.200]   of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.640]   belong to you will become destitute.'" In other words, if you don't come, everyone
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:37.160]   is dying. So Joseph, he recognizes that his brothers are totally freaked out
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.360]   when he had made himself known. So he tells them to come close. And I think
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.480]   this is so powerful if you think about the distance there had been, you know,
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.720]   between his brothers when they, at the time when he sold them in slavery. I mean, I
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.520]   don't think you get much further apart from that when you want to kill your
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.240]   family member and then last second you decide to sell them into slavery. And so
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.080]   but now there's this drawing near and there's the restoring, you know, of this
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.160]   relationship and there's in Joseph and this intimacy of being close to each
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:17.560]   other. He says, "I am Joseph, your brother." Wow. That's amazing.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:26.560]   Now, what I also really appreciate, and I think this is really important, is Joseph
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.440]   does not ignore what actually happened. So even though he wants to
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:38.200]   reconcile, even though he has forgiven them, he still speaks truth. He still
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.240]   acknowledges what happened. "I'm your brother whom you sold into slavery." And
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:49.920]   he actually mentions that twice. "The one you sold. I'm that guy." And I think
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.640]   that's important for us because when we forgive and when we reconcile, it
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.680]   doesn't mean that we suddenly have to pretend like things didn't happen.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.120]   We can actually still truly name the things that have hurt us and that
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:08.680]   have caused us pain. You know, I think that's really important. But then it's
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:15.080]   immediately after that he reassures them. I mean, that is, you
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.360]   know, I think of this emoji, you know, where the head is exploding. That's like
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.440]   mind-blowing, right? Like, not only is he forgiving and reconciling them, now he's
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.720]   like re-ensuring them in this very vulnerable moment where they're like
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:34.680]   totally freaked out. It's like, wow, what kind of love, mercy, and grace is that?
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.600]   Seriously. I mean, just think of that. Like, he's so concerned for them that
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.880]   he's able to pick up on in this very emotional moment and this thing that
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.400]   he's been waiting for for a long time, that they are totally
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.720]   freaked out, and so he cares for them and he reassures them. He says, "Do not be
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:12:00.240]   distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me." Wow. I mean,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.760]   this just bears witness that this is not some casual, he's really, you know,
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.680]   still making up his mind whether or not he's forgiving him. I mean, this is like
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:15.760]   some genuine love, some genuine grace, some genuine forgiveness, some genuine
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:25.480]   reconciliation. And this really raises the question, you know, how in the world
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:32.240]   is Joseph able to do that? You know, where does this love come from? And Joseph,
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.680]   because Joseph is showing us grace that we know from God, that we know
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:43.320]   from Jesus. It's an undeserved grace, you know, where we sin, we sin against God, we
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.920]   sin against other people, and Jesus forgives us by laying down his life on
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.600]   the cross, you know, dying and rising, and we don't deserve this grace and mercy.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:13:00.320]   Joseph is imaging the same forgiving, loving grace in this moment. Like, how is
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.920]   he, where does this come from? Well, I think it comes from God, because Joseph
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.800]   met God in his journey. There was multiple times when we were going
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.200]   through sermon series where it said the Lord was with Joseph, and he showed him
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.960]   his steadfast love, even in dark moments. So Joseph had his deep encounter with
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   the loving and the merciful and the caring God, even in the midst of
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:31.080]   difficulty. So that's one reason. So Joseph himself has experienced
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:37.040]   this love, and he's now giving this love, this grace that he himself has
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:44.880]   experienced. But there's another thing, and I believe that the other reason
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:50.400]   why Joseph is able to do that is because he's able now, at this point in his life,
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.680]   when he looks back after all these events that have occurred, that seem
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:04.440]   seemingly just like a streak of bad luck, and you know, going from bad to worse, he
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:12.560]   sees God's hand at work in all of that. He sees God working through these
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.280]   situations, something that looked random and just, you know, painful before.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:23.760]   Suddenly, Joseph understands that God has brought him to this point with his
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.520]   brothers, with his family, because he wanted to work through Joseph to save
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:35.480]   his family, to bring about a great deliverance from this famine. And that
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:43.120]   this was part of God working underneath the surface of things all along. And
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.240]   Joseph is able just to see the grace and the goodness of God, even in
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:53.200]   those difficult things. And that is another way why he's able to show love,
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.280]   because he can see the love of God in his life. But I want to look with you at
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:03.160]   those three verses here that are highlighted, where Joseph touches on
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.320]   this providence, this talking about God's sovereignty, basically. So in verse
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.720]   five says, "Do not be angry with yourself for selling me here, because it was to
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.880]   save lives that God sent me ahead of you." You know, God was working in this.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:23.080]   Verse seven, "But God sent me ahead of you." Again, God was working in this to
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.400]   preserve you from a remnant from earth. And then verse eight, "So then it was not
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:36.360]   you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, Lord of this entire
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:42.760]   household and ruler of all of Egypt." So Joseph is saying in all this that
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:49.480]   has happened, he now suddenly has a broader view. He has a bigger perspective
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.440]   to what's going on than he had before. You know, beforehand this just looked
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:59.680]   like painful, difficult experiences. And now he's seeing the hand of God working
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.120]   through all these difficult and painful things and bringing him to this point
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:13.560]   for this purpose in this moment. I mean, this is again, emoji, mind-blowing.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:22.480]   Right? Absolutely incredible. Now, let's just think this through a
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.440]   little bit. If Joseph was not sold into slavery, he would have not been brought
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.280]   to Egypt. If he would have not been brought to Egypt, he would have not been
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.720]   part of his household. If he would have not been part of his household, part of
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.840]   his wife would have not accused him of rape. If part of his wife would have not
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.080]   accused him of rape, he would have not been imprisoned in the prison from the
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:49.040]   guard, the chief of the guard. If he would not have been imprisoned in this
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.520]   prison, he would have not met the cup bearer. He would have not met the baker.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.680]   If he would have not interpreted a dream, then when the cup bearer was released
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.760]   and later on Pharaoh had a dream, you know, he could have not told Pharaoh
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.320]   about this guy in prison who can interpret dreams. And then when he
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.280]   interprets the dream, throughout this whole experience he's been
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.680]   learning administrative skills and so he has got, God gives him the grace and the
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   vision for how this dream about seven years of plentiful, seven years of
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.480]   famine, you know, he has a plan for how to address that. And so because of all of
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:32.520]   the series of events, Joseph, you know, is able to save many lives. Isn't that
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.480]   amazing? And there's no way that he could see that or know that or understand that
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.040]   as he's walking through these things. It's only by looking back that he
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:51.240]   sees it, right? And one of the things that God is doing here, he is, if you,
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:57.240]   you know, think of the book of Genesis. He has, God has made a covenant with
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.480]   Abraham and then he makes the same covenant with Isaac and with Jacob,
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:08.200]   Joseph's father. And it is the promise that, you know, God will bless all nations
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.680]   through this line of family. So God is seeing through that this family carries
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:18.480]   forward because if Joseph would not be in Egypt, his family would die in Canaan.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:25.280]   They would die of starvation. But God cares more than just for the family,
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.400]   actually cares for the whole region by providing food. So this is absolutely
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:39.440]   incredible. Now, what I want you to notice is that, actually, let me go back.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   I actually want to say something else first. So just to summarize the story a
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:48.400]   little bit. So then Joseph does bring his father who thought he would never see
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.600]   his son again. So he brings Jacob to Egypt. His father thought he was dead.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.920]   Now he gets to see him, he gets to see his children, he gets to bless them. What a
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.160]   amazing moment, right? When you thought you would never see your child again and
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:08.280]   now you're able to have this, these sort of moments with him. And so this
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:14.040]   family, you know, is really cared for, is really restored. I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.800]   And in Joseph, when he looks at all of this life, he doesn't say, "Oh, well, I guess
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:25.000]   that worked out good." Like, it's not like, "Well, it was kind of sucked but now it
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:34.360]   somehow came together." That's not what he says, right? He says it was God working
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:40.520]   through these things, bringing this great salvation, this great preservation about.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:48.240]   And when theologians talk about this, they talk about either the sovereignty
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.160]   of God or the providence of God. And so I have a definition for you for what that
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:02.200]   is. Divine providence is the understanding that God actively guides
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:08.160]   history and individual lives, ultimately ensuring the fulfillment of his will and
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:17.240]   purposes. Let me read it again. Divine providence is the understanding that God
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:22.120]   actively guides history and individual lives, ultimately ensuring the
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:31.720]   fulfillment of his will and purposes. And God sovereignly will, in his power, in all
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.640]   of his glory, in all of his might, he will accomplish what he has set out to
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:45.240]   accomplish and there is nothing that can stop him from doing that. That is amazing.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:51.680]   But we have a question. I think some of you probably have been asking this and
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:58.200]   that is in these three verses that we looked at, five, seven, and eight, it raised
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   a question. Here's the question. Does God cause bad things to happen to us as part
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.000]   of this providence in our lives? You know, because it emphasizes so strongly that it
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.240]   wasn't Joseph's brothers but God. So does that mean that God somehow sold Joseph
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:24.320]   into slavery? The quick answer is no. You know, God doesn't do evil acts. He doesn't
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:29.520]   commit sin. Joseph's brothers were truly responsible for what they had done. They
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.520]   had sinned. They actually had to repent of their sin. And it was just that God could
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:42.160]   foreknew what would happen and so he chooses to work through this event that
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.600]   is evil, that is not good, but he's bringing about his good purposes. So
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.760]   that's a huge difference. Now there's a lot to this question. I just wanted to
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:22:00.560]   acknowledge it and give a short answer. But I think that's important.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.760]   Now, divine providence is actually different than God working miraculously.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:16.040]   When God works miraculously, he overrides natural laws. Like if I'm ill and sick
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:22.280]   in a terminal way and there is no medical way to help me and somebody
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:28.120]   prays for me and Jesus heals me and the medical community has no idea how this
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:35.560]   is possible, that's a miracle. But that's not providence. You know, providence is
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:43.640]   God working through everyday life events. It's working through normal occurrences,
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.880]   through natural things happening and moving things along. Like we saw in
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.440]   Joseph's life. He worked through the evil act of his brothers. He worked through
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.320]   him learning how to administer in part of his household. He worked through all
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:03.760]   these things, but yet he's weaving together a greater story and there's a
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:10.240]   deeper meaning and he's bringing meaning, a redemptive meaning out of all
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.600]   these events and he's bringing about his purpose. So that is providence, you know,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:23.440]   versus a miracle. Now Joseph at the end of his life, or actually it's not the end
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.320]   of his life, it's the end of chapter 50, which is the last chapter of Genesis, he
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:34.680]   summarizes his life again and he highlights this providence again. This
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.520]   is the most famous verse actually from the story of Joseph. It's Genesis 50,
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.720]   verse 20, and it says this, "You intended to harm," he's talking to his brothers, "but
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.960]   God intended it for good, to come to what is now being done, the saving of many
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:58.080]   lives." So God can turn other people's evil intentions and he can take them and
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   work in and through them and bring about something redemptive, something good. And
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.720]   then even those who intend to harm, his brothers who intended to harm
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:13.800]   Joseph, you know, God ultimately brought about good. And it's also interesting
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.520]   that this is highlighted again, so I think this is a theme God really wants
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.760]   us to see. He really wants us to know this because it's highlighted so
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:31.080]   strongly in the story of Joseph. But this brings us to the point, what about us? You
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:37.880]   know, Joseph's life invites us to reflect on how can we know, see,
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:43.360]   understand the providence of God in our lives? How can we see these maybe
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:49.640]   randomly seeming events, you know, that there is actually God weaving a greater
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:55.640]   story out of that? You know, what do we do? It's all great that
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.760]   this is written about in the Bible, but what about our lives? How can we see that
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:04.360]   in our life? And I want to just think with us about this and have a few
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:09.920]   thoughts I think are important as we process this. So the first thing is,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.520]   and I think this is really important to say, that not everything that happens to
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:20.760]   you is good. And I think this is absolutely crucial. What Joseph's
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:27.800]   brothers did to him was not good. Being sold into slavery is not good. Suffering
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:36.080]   as a slave is not good. You know, so that is super important. Just because
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.360]   God works through something bad and brings something good out of it doesn't
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.800]   mean that the thing that happened is good. So that's the first thing
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:53.360]   that I think is absolutely crucial. Second, and is going talking a little
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.960]   bit more about the providence. You know, seeing God's providence in our lives, it
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.800]   gives us a broader perspective. It's like we're giving a different set of eyes, or
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:09.320]   it's like if this room was dark, we see very limited things. And it's like seeing
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.840]   the providence of God is like somebody switched on the light switch and
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:17.280]   suddenly we can see so much more by looking at the same place. So the same is
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.640]   true with our lives. When we look at our lives, you know, a lot of times it's like
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.840]   it's dark and we don't see anything that God is doing. But when the light switch
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:33.320]   is flipped on, then suddenly we can see this broader thing that God is doing,
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:40.120]   that God is working out. And we can see his grace and his mercy, and we can see
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.360]   him bringing about good. And so in light of God's providence, there's now a
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.080]   redemptive aspect that emerges that we can see. And I have a statement here I
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.080]   want to share with you. I'm very proud of this one, by the way. It says, "Seeing God's
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.240]   providence in our lives means the goodness of God has become visible
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:06.200]   within experiences that we formerly perceived as only mundane, meaningless,
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:17.360]   dark, difficult, or painful." That's that light switch. And it's amazing when God
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.040]   gives us the grace to see what he's been doing in our lives like he did with
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:28.440]   Joseph. And it's incredible news for us as Christians, if you're a Christian here.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.800]   Because it means that we can, not always, I don't think always, but a lot of times
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:39.160]   by God's grace we can see meaning in our suffering, meaning in something that has
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:46.080]   been painful. That's amazing. Now I think on this side of eternity, we're not going
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.560]   to understand everything. Not everything is going to be clear or make sense or,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.280]   you know, how God was weaving something great out of it. But I think we're going
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.880]   to see, or I know, I'm very confident about this, we're going to see enough to
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.640]   know that God is good, that he's powerful, that he's mighty, that he's sovereign,
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.160]   and that he's bringing about good purposes in our lives that he has set
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:13.920]   forth to bring forth in our life. Can I get an amen to that? Amen. And then now to
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.920]   the question, how do we see God's providence in our lives? Well, we see God's
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.880]   providence in our lives by looking backwards. When we're in the midst of it, I'm sure
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.200]   Joseph didn't see right when he was throwing in the pit. He's like, "I know this is
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.520]   part of God's plan. You know, my brothers are trying to kill me and they throw me
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:36.880]   in here." Or when he's dragged to Egypt, you know, he didn't see in the moment that
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.960]   this must be a greater plan of God in some way or form. So we see God's
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.640]   providence, God's goodness, you know, in our lives by looking backwards over our
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.240]   lives. And I want to share with you one way that I've been able to see God's
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:57.480]   providence, God's goodness in my own life. When I graduated from
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:04.600]   seminary in 2005, I went to Germany. I took a job as a pastor in a local German
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.840]   church, and I was now two hours away from my parents. I'd been 10 years in the US,
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.040]   so I'm back after 10 years. And after a half, actually it was a little bit longer,
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:22.440]   not less than a year, my father was diagnosed with cancer in 2006. And it was a
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.600]   very aggressive, a very rare form of cancer. Now my father was a doctor, so we
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:33.200]   had access to the whole medical community, the best treatments. Even in
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.840]   the church I was serving, there was an expert oncologist who was doing some
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:42.840]   cutting-edge stuff. It didn't matter. My father passed away in less than a year
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:49.880]   from the point where he was diagnosed, and passed away in 2007. In 2008, I
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.480]   moved to Hong Kong. So this was three years, 2005-2008, I was in Germany. So my
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.200]   time there was my first job out of seminary, which was a little bit up and
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.120]   down. There was some good stuff, not so good stuff in my first job. Then there was
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:08.040]   a period of my father being, you know, just in excruciating pain and agonizing,
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.560]   and us walking as a family with my father. And then there was a period of
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:19.120]   grieving and of loss. So it just seemed like a big mess. I didn't see any, I mean
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.320]   in my job, of course, I see a purpose of God. I'm a pastor, right, so I should see
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.720]   some purpose in what I'm doing. But I didn't see like that God was somehow
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:31.560]   providentially working in all of this. I didn't see it. And in Hong Kong, I, you
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:37.560]   know, in the church was a youth pastor, it was a sermon. And it just really sparked
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:43.160]   something inside of me where I prayed more over all that had happened. And then
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.880]   suddenly, and I don't know quite how to explain it, but God showed me his love
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:54.440]   and grace, his providence of how he was working in this very dark and difficult
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:59.640]   moment and season in my life. Now one thing I hadn't told you was, I actually
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:06.800]   had made a decision I will never move back to Germany. I don't know
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.680]   about you, sometimes when you make a certain decision, it's pretty certain. So
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.280]   I decided in the US, I was like, this is not my home, I'm living here, I'm never going
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:23.240]   back. But yet I had gone back to Germany, which I never intended to do. I had been
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.840]   gone for 10 years. Now if you live abroad, if your family lives abroad, and I know
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.280]   some of your families abroad, you don't see them all the time. And so now
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.240]   suddenly I was home and I was able to spend time with my parents. Yes, they were
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.680]   two hours away, but two hour drive is so much easier than paying a million
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:45.240]   dollars to fly over the ocean. And so I was able to spend time with my father. My
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:51.640]   father had to sell his practice quite quickly. And so in part of that process,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.440]   he wanted to write a letter to his patients because he had a
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.280]   close relationship with his patients. And so I helped him write a letter and we
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.240]   wrote a letter together talking about the hope of Jesus, even in the face of
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.280]   death. And it was such an incredible response, that letter. My father was so
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.760]   encouraged. I was able to express how I felt to my father. It's not like always
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.080]   in family you talk about how you love each other and care for each other. And I
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:20.040]   was able to tell him, I'm not always that expressive or that good with
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.880]   words, especially when it comes to that, you know, but I was really able to
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:33.880]   express my heart to him. And he told me that he delighted in me. And he blessed
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:39.640]   me. He prayed a prayer of blessing over all of his children. Isn't that amazing?
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.200]   So even though this was a dark and painful experience, and certainly it
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.960]   wasn't a good experience, I don't have to call my father dying of cancer good, but
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:53.080]   nonetheless I can see God providentially working and caring for me and my family.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.720]   And I was able to help. I was there. My siblings were in the US. I'm the only
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.120]   child home. I was able to be there in this difficult season. And when I saw
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:06.160]   that, I was just overcome, you know, by God's love and care for me. In a time
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:12.200]   when beforehand I could see nothing. Isn't that amazing? You know, God is so
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:17.720]   good and he loves us and he wants us to know his goodness. He wants us to know
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.640]   that even in the moments where we cannot see what he's doing, he is at work on
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:29.200]   your behalf. He is sovereignly at work. Now, again, I just want to get a little
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.040]   more practical. So I want to share with you four ways of, you know, how you can
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:38.000]   engage with God. If you're wondering, "God, how are you at work in my life?" You
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.760]   know, it's great that there's a Joseph story. It's great that Pastor Tim has a
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:46.320]   story. But what about my life? I want to share with you four different ways of
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:54.960]   how you can sort of engage this topic. The first one is take time to
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.860]   assure yourself that God's at work even though you don't always see it, feel it,
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:06.320]   or know it. Now, how do you do that? I think part of that is really meditating
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.880]   on who God is. Going in his word, looking at the story of Joseph, looking at
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:16.240]   promises of God. It's letting the Spirit of God speak to you and assure
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:23.080]   you of who God is. That he's a God who loves you, who's for you, who's not
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:31.200]   against you. So that's the first thing. The second one is pray and ask God for his
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:37.160]   revelation to you about what he's doing and how he's at work in your life. You
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.400]   know, it's amazing when we ask God things, he actually answers us a lot of
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.960]   times. And so we can ask God in prayer. Now, this might not be one prayer. Maybe
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.640]   this is like a season of prayer. But we can ask God to reveal to us, to help us
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:56.840]   understand, to help us see. So that's the second thing. The third one is share your
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:03.000]   journey with trusted community and invite them to help you discern. I shared
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.560]   it before in an even more darker season of my life that I could not see God's
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.240]   love and God's goodness. And I was talking with a friend and he said, "Tim,
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.200]   don't you see how much people love you? They're taking you in their home. You
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:21.480]   know, they're letting you be part of their family." I wasn't able to see it
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:25.560]   myself. So we need a lot of times in community, other people that help us to
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.560]   see God's goodness. They can speak that over our lives. They can point that out.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.680]   Because we're a lot of times like blind. And then the final one is ask God to
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.280]   strengthen you, your resolve, and your trust in times when you are feeling
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.720]   overwhelmed. You know, even though I've experienced God's sovereignly work in my
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:48.480]   life and providentially, it doesn't mean that when I'm facing new difficult
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.720]   circumstances that there is no anxiousness, that there is no worry, and
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:58.920]   that I'm not overwhelmed by what's going on. And so we can ask God to strengthen
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:06.040]   us, to renew our trust in Him, to fill us with a spirit, to give us the courage and
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:11.280]   grace to face even just whatever is going on. And so what I want to do right
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:17.440]   now is actually want to invite you to just take this moment right now to think
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:23.960]   for yourself, "Which one of these four do I want to do this week?" Like, do I want to
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:29.560]   pray? Do I want to actually try to get in community or catch up with a friend? Do I
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:35.240]   want to read God's Word? Do I need to ask God to give me resolve and strength? So
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.840]   I'm just going to give a minute here, and I also want to invite the worship team to
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:43.200]   come up at this point in time, just to prayerfully connect with God around
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   these questions, and then I'll pray over us. So let's do this right now. Let's just
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:54.240]   take a moment and just think about how God is inviting us to respond. Jesus, you
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:37:01.400]   know every single one of our journeys. You know what we have gone through. You
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:09.160]   know what's going on in our lives right now. And Jesus, I thank you that you are
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:15.000]   Lord of our lives, that you sovereignly stand over our lives. I thank you that
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.080]   you love us, every single person here. I thank you that you are at work
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.560]   and places where we can't see it, where we cannot even dream of, that you could
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:33.520]   possibly be at work in those areas. But Holy Spirit, I just want to invite you
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:40.960]   right now. You know we can talk about all these things, Lord, but I just pray that
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:46.360]   you make yourself known in these difficult places that we've been, where
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:53.440]   we have seen no meaning, no purpose, just suffering, just pain. I pray that you
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:38:01.200]   would show us, you know, how you have been there for us, how you are redeeming some
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.080]   of those difficult things that we are going through, that you make them known
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.520]   to us,
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:17.680]   that you reveal your love for us, that you love us, that you love every single
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:28.520]   person here passionately. Thank you, Jesus, that your purpose will be
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.480]   accomplished, that it will not be thwarted. It doesn't matter what evil
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:40.040]   others throw at us. Your purpose for us is going to come to pass. And I pray that
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:45.960]   you would raise faith, that you raise faith in us, that you give us a resilient,
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.560]   a strong and courageous faith in you, not because of us, but because of who you are
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:58.760]   and because of your Spirit ministering to our hearts. And so I thank you, Lord, for your
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:04.000]   sovereignty, for your providence. I thank you, Jesus, for your grace and your mercy
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.400]   over our lives. And I just pray for your revelation now to your church, to your
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:18.400]   people. I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Let's worship church.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.980]   (gentle music)
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.560]   (gentle music)
