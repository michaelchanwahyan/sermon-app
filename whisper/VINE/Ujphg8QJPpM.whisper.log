[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Well, as you have a seat, why don't you turn around, say hi to someone, bless them, love them, be friendly.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   Say, "Wow, you're here. Nice to see you."
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.040]   Wonderful.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.800]   Well, if you're just joining us, welcome to the Vine. If you're just joining us online, welcome as well.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.680]   My name is Andrew. I'm one of the pastors here, and we're in a series called "The Promise of Better Days,"
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.440]   a series looking at Christmas from the Old Testament,
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.400]   looking at the Old Testament prophetic hope for the arrival of Jesus. And I couldn't be more excited
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.520]   that we've got Promise Armstrong with us today. Can we put our hands together as I am, if I promise to be here?
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.160]   Why don't we stretch out our hands? Let's pray.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.440]   Father, we're just so grateful for this family amongst us, Promise, Kayla, Elias.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.000]   Lord, we're so grateful for who they are,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.240]   for the many sacrifices that they've given in their lives to minister in the kingdom as they do.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.840]   Lord, I know that you've placed this word onto Promise today.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.120]   And Lord, as he begins to open up Scripture, both in the New and Old Testament,
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.160]   we pray that you would continue to open up our hearts to the hope that is found fully in Christ Jesus.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.760]   And we thank you for this in your name. Amen.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.920]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.680]   How's you guys doing?
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.840]   Good. It's good to see you. It's good to be here.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.040]   We are in week two of our Advent series called "The Promise of Better Days" and how fitting that a guy named Promise
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.880]   gets to preach in this series.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.600]   This series is designed to help us put ourselves in the shoes of those who are experiencing
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.000]   Advent for the very first time, because we're actually on the opposite end of that spectrum, right?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.600]   We are living in those promised better days. And because of that, we can oftentimes
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.400]   become unaware of the weight that Advent would have had for the first century Jewish people.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.720]   That first century Jewish people would be one who were clothed and drenched in a prophetic hope,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.200]   believing that their Messiah would come and intervene into their world.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.520]   And their world was pretty similar to ours. It wasn't easy-go-lucky, everything working like daisies in sunshine.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.840]   It was pretty messy, chaotic, full of turmoil and confusion, broken and frustrated.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.280]   And the only thing that could save and could fix what they were experiencing was for something like a Messiah to come.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.480]   And so the prophecies that had been made centuries before, they were in anticipation, waiting for that day.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.720]   And the gospel writer Matthew, one of the disciples, he provides us the birth narrative of Jesus.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.160]   But more than that, he lays out for us a logical sequence, revealing and unveiling just who the Messiah would be,
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.840]   but also something even cooler, what that Messiah would mean for those people then, and for you and me this morning.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.920]   Now, last week, Pastor Andrew kicked off our series by examining the detailed account from Matthew.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.360]   And of course, just to remind us, Matthew is speaking predominantly to a Jewish audience,
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.960]   which means that they'd be very, very familiar with biblical prophecy and old promises.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.640]   And it's in this account of the birth story of Jesus that Matthew reveals that Jesus born would be
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.400]   the fulfillment of the hope that they had longed for.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.840]   He pulls from the text in Isaiah 7, some words that we might know.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.160]   It says that the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and you will give him the name Emmanuel,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.440]   God dwelling with us.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.640]   Now, to a people who are heavy with hope for a Messiah to come, this was massive to them.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.080]   Jesus would be that Messiah. God would come and be with them.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.920]   It would be everything to that audience.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.680]   What Matthew was actually saying is that what had been lost in Eden,
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.360]   the closeness and nearness of God was now on the verge of being re-established for God's people.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.760]   God was no longer at a distance.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.120]   He wasn't just, his presence was no longer just going to be in a temple or in an ark of the covenant
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.280]   or in some tabernacle, but it would be dwelling with you and with me.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.120]   It would be with us to stay.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.880]   That was big for them.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.720]   God walking incarnate in flesh for his people, even more available to them.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.800]   That's the hope that they're anticipating for.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.320]   And Matthew doesn't just stop there.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.880]   We get to chapter 2, Matthew ends up building a bit more.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.680]   And I'm actually really, really excited about this passage.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.480]   I found it very, very fun to study and to understand.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.320]   And I can't wait for you guys to see that Matthew just doesn't say that God is with us,
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.880]   but what is God going to do when he's with us?
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.160]   What's that going to be like?
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.520]   How is God going to be like?
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.680]   And Matthew chapter 2 picks up there.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.920]   So if we turn your eyes to the screen, we'll read it here.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.840]   It says, "After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.680]   Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked,
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.160]   'Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews?
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.720]   We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.'
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.240]   When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed and all of Jerusalem with him.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.200]   When he had called together all the chief priests and teachers of the law,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.680]   he asked them, 'Where is the Messiah to be born?'
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.480]   'In Bethlehem in Judea,' they replied, 'for this is what the prophet has written.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.760]   'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.560]   For out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people, Israel.'"
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.960]   And it's a similar vibe to what we read about last week.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.840]   Matthew, once again, is pulling from an Old Testament prophet.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.960]   Like Isaiah, he's pulling from the book of Micah.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.520]   Micah was also an eighth century prophet,
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.640]   living around the same time as Isaiah, a contemporary of his.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.120]   They would have been both prophesying to the same group of people.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.000]   If you remember correctly, Israel had been divided and split.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.720]   There was the 10 tribes that formed the northern kingdom, called the northern kingdom.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.880]   And then there was two tribes, Judah and Benjamin, that formed the southern kingdom of Judah.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.600]   Micah and Isaiah are both prophesying this.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.680]   And actually what happens here is what Isaiah has started and said
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.720]   about a virgin conceiving and giving birth to a child,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.600]   Micah is actually picking up on that and explaining to us
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.640]   just what that child is going to be, who he's going to be,
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.880]   and how his existence is going to impact his people permanently.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.480]   Let's look at Micah to get a bit more of an understanding of the whole of what that passage says.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.800]   So looking at Micah chapter 5, verses 2 through 6, it says this,
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.680]   "But you, Bethlehem, though you are small among the clans of Judah,
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.520]   out of you will come from me one who is ruler over Israel,
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.960]   whose origins are from old, from ancient times.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.480]   Therefore Israel will be abandoned until the time when she who is in labor bears a son,
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.600]   and the rest of his brothers return and join the Israelites.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.200]   He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord,
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.000]   and in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.160]   and they will live securely.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.960]   And then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth."
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.240]   And catch this, "And he will be our peace."
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.400]   See, this passage has so much in it.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.320]   There's so many threads to unravel,
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.080]   but I want to focus on what I see as the three main motifs or themes in this passage.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.800]   There's the small, the ruler, and the redemption.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.400]   So in this whole passage, three big things Micah is pulling out is,
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.360]   there's a small, there's a ruler, and there's a redemption.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.360]   And he relates it kind of like this.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.920]   God is going to intervene in their world.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.000]   God is going to act.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.200]   He's going to act in some small way, seemingly.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.360]   It's going to be out of something small that a great ruler is going to come
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.760]   and impact that entire area.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.120]   And that ruler's way of ruling will be something new and unexpected.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.440]   But in that rule, he will usher in their redemption.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.160]   Now, Micah speaks this, and this is deeply encouraging,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.360]   because for the people that are hearing this,
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.480]   their context is that they have the Assyrians
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.160]   who are waiting to attack them and destroy their cities.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.480]   And the prophecy actually says, not just the Assyrians,
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.920]   but after the Assyrians destroy them, then the Babylonians eventually will come.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.840]   It's not a pretty time to be in that nation.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.800]   It's war, it's attack, it's dangerous, and they are scared and frustrated.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.640]   So when you hear that a Messiah is coming, one will save you,
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.960]   it bubbles up in them a hope.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:45.640]   And Matthew is hoping that they would see that Jesus being born in Bethlehem,
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.200]   that Jesus is the fulfillment of this prophecy.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   So Matthew sets the scene, right?
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.440]   He talks about Herod, and Herod is the king.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.280]   Herod is king, but he's kind of like proxy king,
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.320]   because he's not really Jewish.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.600]   He's been placed there by the Romans, so he might be a little bit insecure.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.840]   And he hears that another king is going to come.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.640]   So obviously, Herod is a bit threatened and frustrated,
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.480]   and he gathers together those who might understand the prophecy well.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.640]   He gathers all of them together in a room, and he says,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.040]   ask them the million dollar question, "Where?"
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.920]   Where is this going to happen?
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.440]   Not because he wants to go and hang out,
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.000]   like he has probably had some bad things on his mind.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.920]   Where is this going to take place?
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.840]   And they point him to that prophecy,
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.360]   and they tell him that it will take place in the little town of Bethlehem,
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.840]   which leads us to our very first theme, the small.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.680]   So both of the passages in Micah and in Matthew
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.960]   build and begin around this time of Bethlehem.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.200]   This time of Bethlehem is not random.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.240]   It's actually a location that's intentional to signal and reveal characteristics
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.880]   about who the Messiah actually would be.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.280]   So why is Micah using Bethlehem?
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.800]   It's probably the question Herod is asking,
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.200]   because Bethlehem, in reality, is kind of small.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   It's not important.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.640]   Nothing great is coming from there.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.400]   It's not an economic powerhouse.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   It's not a good military space.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.440]   There's nothing really great about Bethlehem.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.880]   It doesn't have a big population.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.000]   It's not like the capital.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.680]   Like, why Bethlehem of all places?
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.960]   Bethlehem is small.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.360]   It's a place that has more sheep than people.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.200]   It's like the equivalent of New Zealand.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.900]   Yikes.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:21.800]   But that reality somewhat is what veils the prophecy from the people and blinds them,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.680]   because the first century Jewish readers would have known about this prophesied location,
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.280]   but they would expect that their king that's coming to save them
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.840]   would come from somewhere of more importance,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.120]   somewhere more strategic,
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.560]   somewhere more fitting of a ruler or of a king,
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.720]   somewhere of honor and benefit.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.600]   Not Bethlehem.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.120]   Bethlehem is too small,
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.760]   and for that reason, the prophetic didn't match with their perspective.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.520]   And although they knew the location,
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.840]   they didn't go and see the birth.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.440]   Think about that.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.960]   They knew the prophecies.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.600]   They could read it and tell you where it's going.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   But because they had a different perspective and a different expectation,
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:11.000]   we don't read about any of them going and seeing the birth of their promised Messiah.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.600]   Because the location was small, the small.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.120]   But the small would have significance.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.600]   It would tie back to the greatest Jewish dynastic family.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.160]   See, there was once a small brother,
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.680]   the smallest of a bunch of brothers,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.600]   and he grew up in the small town of Bethlehem.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.240]   And this small brother in a small town would end up
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.680]   rising and ruling and reigning over a nation in an odd fashion,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.680]   a bit different than what's expected.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.600]   He wouldn't be the first choice for anyone.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.040]   Of course, I'm speaking of David, son of Jesse.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:49.080]   Matthew would see that connection between David and Jesus,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.880]   and he would see that Jesus is a type of David.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.120]   And if Jesus is a type of David,
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.920]   well, what are the two things that David is most famously known for?
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.120]   He's a shepherd, he's a ruler.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.520]   He's a shepherd ruler.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.240]   And Michael would use this very language in making the connection
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.840]   between that great past king and an even greater coming Messiah.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.640]   King David would stand as a bit of an archetype
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.920]   for what it means to be a shepherd and a ruler.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.520]   And if this prophecy is true, then the hope is not just hope.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.800]   It is great hope.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.640]   It is very promising hope.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.240]   Because when David was in power, remember the stories,
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.480]   David was winning battles after battles.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.720]   And there were songs, "David killed his thousands,"
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.240]   or "David killed 10,000, but Saul only killed 1,000."
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.240]   David was a great, strong warrior.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.000]   When he was in power, he was a man close to God's own heart.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.360]   He was a man that loved God.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.240]   And it was so evident for the people to see
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.280]   that when David was in power, man, God was for us.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.320]   God was with us.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.160]   God was moving on our behalf.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160]   The presence of God was available.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.600]   It was the best of days.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.280]   It was the golden age of Israel when David was in power.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.400]   So if this prophecy is true, one coming like David
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:09.880]   would bring absolute hope to a people who are in a tense position.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.520]   Man, if this prophecy was true,
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.560]   it was a prophecy of a promise of greater days,
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.760]   of a great ruler to come and to rule for God's people again.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.520]   So we have to ask ourself when we look in this passage,
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.680]   what will that ruler be like?
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.720]   He'll be like David.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.160]   He'll be a shepherd and a ruler, but exactly what will he be like?
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.080]   So Micah would describe this ruler in a very particular word.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.800]   If we look back at verse four, he'll say this.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.560]   Speaking of the ruler,
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.840]   "He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord."
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.200]   Shepherd his flock.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.000]   This great ruler.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.720]   I mean, remember guys,
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.240]   there are people wanting to attack and destroy this nation.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.880]   This great ruler that we've been wanting will stand and shepherd his flock.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.440]   See, Matthew wants us to see through this Micah passage
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.480]   that this idea of a shepherd is going to catch
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.200]   the first century believers off guard.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.040]   The Messiah coming in the fashion of a son of Bethlehem.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.680]   Yes, from a small place in the likeness of David.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.160]   Yes, he will rule, but he'll rule like a shepherd.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.680]   I think perhaps this is the reason that the angels go to the shepherds
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:32.120]   and they are the first ones to see Jesus when he's born, a shepherd king.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.320]   And I use that combination of words, shepherd and king,
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.160]   because it's actually the word that's used for ruling and reigning in this passage.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.560]   It's different from the expectation
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.160]   because when you're facing such a frustrating time,
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.760]   when you're in the valley,
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.800]   when death might be knocking on the door,
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.880]   the last thing you're looking for is a shepherd.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.960]   Your expectation and their expectation was pretty militaristic.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.480]   They wanted a strong king.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.520]   They wanted a description of someone who would be conquering and reigning,
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.120]   but Micah doesn't give them that.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.920]   See, what they would prescribe to their situation
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.600]   is not someone described as a shepherd.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.520]   To put it bluntly, they're wanting peace and restoration.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.720]   They aren't wanting a shepherd.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.840]   They're wanting a warrior,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.280]   someone to come and bring them peace,
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.800]   to rule over and vanquish all of their enemies,
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.480]   all of the difficulties that they're facing.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.040]   But this Messiah would be different.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.200]   This Messiah wouldn't be like the Herods of the world
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.720]   or the Caesars of the world
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.080]   or any other contemporary leader.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.800]   He is a shepherd king.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.760]   He comes to rule his people the way that a shepherd rules,
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.720]   leading and guiding his flock,
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.160]   to shepherd the flock of Israel, as it says.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.240]   And perhaps that is the reason it's so obvious yet Jesus is missed.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.960]   Perhaps that's why only non-Jewish wise men
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.480]   are the ones to show up at his birth.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:07.880]   They miss what's right in front of their eyes.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.880]   And I think it's something we have to be careful.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.640]   When our expectations are so vast and so great
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.960]   that we might miss the most precious,
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.000]   the gift that provides the most,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.920]   the very gift that we need.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.000]   It was right in front of them and they missed it.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.040]   The shepherd king Messiah born to them
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.640]   as a little boy in Bethlehem.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.880]   This is why Matthew connects the birth story with Jesus
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.320]   to the idea of Emmanuel.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.200]   God is with us as that first promise.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.520]   And Matthew now explains the how,
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.800]   that God is not just with us,
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.000]   but God is with us like a shepherd is with his flock,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.560]   like a shepherd with his sheep.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.920]   This connects and defines the way
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.800]   that this great Messiah was going to rule.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.720]   His style of ruling would not be like Herod's.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.000]   It'd be more closely related to that of Psalm 23,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.200]   which funnily enough is written by David born in Bethlehem.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:06.120]   And if God is with us like a shepherd,
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.320]   he's with us intimately.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.640]   He's with us closely.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.320]   He's watching like a shepherd would to his sheep.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.800]   And that is what provides shalom.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.320]   And that's what provides peace.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.800]   And that's what allows them to be secure.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.400]   You know, I've never seen this.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.000]   Tell me if you disagree.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.960]   I've never seen sheep going crazy,
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.680]   worried about where their meal is gonna come from,
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.120]   worried about the next step,
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.880]   worried about the change in their location,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.920]   worried about the weather,
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.200]   worried about provision,
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.720]   worried about you name it.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.800]   I don't see anxious sheep.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.200]   Be an interesting sight, but I don't see that.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.680]   And I think it's because of this,
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.880]   because the sheep know where their protection comes from.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.680]   It's not up to them.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.560]   They know where the direction comes from.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.520]   It's not up to them.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.360]   They've got a shepherd for that.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.520]   They know where to go because they follow the shepherd.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.840]   They know how to get food because they follow the shepherd.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.240]   Everything that they need, they have a shepherd for that.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.040]   And it's the same with us.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.440]   The peace that we need to live securely,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:14.920]   we only get from the shepherd and the shepherd is with us.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.800]   The hope that we need to keep our heads up,
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.840]   we'll only get from the shepherd and the shepherd is with us.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.720]   The comfort and the provision, the direction,
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.280]   the guidance, the patience,
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.360]   all the things that we need,
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.680]   we can only get from the shepherd.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.880]   And the good news is this.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.560]   The shepherd is with you.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   The shepherd is with you to protect, to lead and to guide.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.240]   God knows us.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   The shepherd knows his flock.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.200]   Every single one of it.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.360]   Scripture would say that God knows the number of hairs on your head.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.480]   That might feel like a weird detail, but he just knows you that well.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.480]   Like there's nothing about you he doesn't know.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.760]   The shepherd would know the flock
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.880]   and he walks closely leading us into green pastures.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.920]   God has stepped into their world
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.560]   and has stepped into our world, comforting and leading us.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.160]   And the reality is this,
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.440]   that Advent reminds us that God has now come
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.600]   and there's a great king who leads like a shepherd
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.880]   but has made himself available to us,
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:27.160]   ruling like a shepherd and giving us the best chance possible.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.000]   And that's good news.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.760]   That's hope.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.520]   It's a precious reality when we can see that this is the promise of Advent,
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.360]   the rule and reign of a shepherd king.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.920]   Now there's still quite a bit of stuff in this passage
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.120]   that Micah is showing us
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.480]   and I wanna make sure we don't miss it.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.120]   So I'm gonna break it down into three words
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.040]   that are highlighted and emphasized in this latter half of the passage.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.800]   Micah would speak about a shepherd,
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.720]   which we just talked about in great detail.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.880]   He would speak about peace or the Hebrew word shalom.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.240]   Thirdly, he would speak about securely or security, living securely.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.480]   And Micah would connect all three of these things
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.520]   into the single idea that the shepherd is the symbol of peace.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.400]   And if we have that peace, we can live securely.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.240]   Hear that again.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.960]   The shepherd is the symbol of peace.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.800]   And if we have peace, we can live securely.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.000]   You know, the flock is at peace if the flock has a shepherd.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.320]   Because a good shepherd does everything the flock needs,
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:39.640]   provides in every way for the flock to gaze and to live in peace.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.040]   And Micah would actually say it like this in verse five,
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.520]   describing the rule and reign of Jesus as,
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.680]   "And he will be our peace."
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.400]   Now I have said two words interchangeably, shalom and peace.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.920]   And I wanna clarify what they mean
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.440]   because shalom is a Jewish word, the Hebrew word.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.640]   We don't go around saying shalom to everyone, last I checked.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.320]   But we do say peace.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.240]   And peace is a part of shalom, but shalom is a much wider ordeal.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.240]   Shalom is maybe one of the biggest concepts within the Jewish scriptures.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.360]   Shalom is this idea of complete rest.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.560]   Shalom is what we find in Genesis one and two.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.000]   The garden of Eden where everything is made right,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.760]   where there's actual calm.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.840]   And there's peace.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.320]   Shalom is speaking of things as they should be, things in order.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.680]   Could you imagine that?
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.480]   How nice it would be.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.640]   Creation at ease.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.440]   The idea of being naked and unashamed,
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.520]   meaning we have no reason to hide, no reason to fear,
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.040]   no reason to constantly look over our shoulder,
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.480]   nothing to be ashamed of.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.960]   So the Jewish people have longed for this existence,
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.840]   this shalom where they could be in this rest,
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.520]   in this peace of God and live their lives to the fullest.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.000]   And the entire story of the Bible from Genesis three onward
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.320]   is humanity's pursuit of entering into God's rest,
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.160]   back into his shalom.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.600]   And they would desire this, not just theoretically,
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.040]   but may I remind us again,
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.480]   because they have enemies knocking on their door.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.800]   They would desire peace to be freed from the Roman occupiers
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.520]   in the first century.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:25.080]   They would desire rest to be freed from the tensions of broken systems.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:30.440]   They would desire for things to be made right in relationships again.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.720]   They would want full restoration to where sin no longer has a hold on them,
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.560]   but instead they are fully restored in relationship with God.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.320]   It's the shalom and the peace that makes it possible to live securely.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:49.000]   Shalom and peace is the very definition of living securely.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.200]   You can't live securely without peace, without shalom.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.640]   This is the point I think Matthew's trying to make here.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.400]   And it's really critical,
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.360]   understanding shalom and our pursuit towards that.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.040]   See, what the audience might've believed,
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.400]   knowing that shalom is such a big deal,
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.920]   is that when the Messiah comes,
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.960]   he will lead us towards our shalom.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.520]   That's good, right?
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.280]   Like this is when the Messiah comes,
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.200]   he will lead us to where we can all be at peace,
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.000]   to a state of peace.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.920]   He will show us how to get to peace.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.480]   He will give us a path, a way towards peace.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.520]   But this passage actually offers a revelation
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.120]   that's significantly more powerful, more permanent than that.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.160]   Jesus comes and doesn't point you to peace.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.320]   It doesn't say peace is that way, go there.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.680]   It doesn't give you three easy steps for peace.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.560]   No, when the Messiah comes, Micah says,
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.200]   he will be our shalom.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.000]   He will be our peace.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.280]   Peace isn't found in the perfect circumstance.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.240]   Peace is found in a person.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:01.160]   And that person has come so that you and I
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.080]   can live securely, to live in confidence.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.360]   And the truth is this, we will wear ourselves out.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.160]   We will drain our hopes if we believe
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.280]   that peace is a status of world events.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.080]   If peace is just getting all of our affairs in order,
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.240]   just ridding ourselves of any trouble.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.920]   No, peace can actually exist
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.160]   when there's trouble around us.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.920]   Think back to the garden, Eden, shalom,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.960]   but there's still a snake.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.760]   Think back to this beautiful imagery of Psalm 23.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.840]   Our great shepherd is leading us, yes, into green pastures,
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.960]   but through valleys of the shadow of death and darkness.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.440]   Peace isn't a setting, it's a person.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.600]   Recognize that we will have trouble in this world.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.280]   We're all gonna have that.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.200]   It's guaranteed to every single one of us.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.560]   But we can still be at peace and live securely
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.960]   because peace is our shepherd that's guiding us.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.920]   Peace is a person that is available to us.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.840]   Peace is Jesus.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:09.240]   And here's how this news gets spread.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.680]   Here's how this news gets a little bit better.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.320]   So lean in.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.800]   We don't have to go looking for peace anymore.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.400]   Because of Advent, we don't have to go searching for peace.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.320]   We don't have to wonder where peace is.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.200]   Peace has actually come to you.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.920]   It's interesting, it's not even like a 50/50 thing.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.720]   Like he came all the way down, 100% of the way.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.440]   Peace is here.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.760]   It's really close, it's really close.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.600]   It's intimately close to us.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.720]   Peace has come and is available to you already.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.520]   He has already begun a restoration in us.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.640]   Shalom doesn't mean an end to our problems,
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.600]   but the profundity of our peace is recognized
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.960]   when we can be at rest,
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.520]   even in the turmoil of a messy world.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:01.160]   Where we can be, as you've heard us preach over this past year,
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.400]   a non-anxious presence in the chaos of this world.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.800]   Advent stands as a reminder that because Emmanuel,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.560]   because God is with us, we can live securely.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.000]   Because he has given us a shepherd to rule and to guide
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.840]   and to walk with us, we can now live where we can take a breath
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.680]   and not have to have every decision and every behavior,
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.360]   a response to fear.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.000]   We can live unashamed and confidently.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.840]   Peace is what will bring us our security.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.240]   And we have this peace, we have this shalom
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.800]   because God has come so close to us.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.520]   I do recognize that it isn't always the way we feel.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.520]   I recognize that hard days are hard days
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.040]   and hard seasons are hard seasons.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.120]   I've definitely had a fair share of them as well.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.560]   But we live now in the promised better days
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.720]   that they were so longing for,
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.480]   where the fullness of peace is so accessible.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.360]   Although we have moments of fear,
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.720]   Advent means that we can choose to slow down,
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.480]   to take a breath and purposely remind ourselves
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.320]   that peace is available to you.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.880]   In this situation, peace is available to you.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:21.080]   Peace in the form of a good shepherd king who knows us,
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.960]   who knows our moments, who walks with us,
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.000]   who is sufficient enough to be everything we need
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.800]   to provide us the strength for every single day,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.040]   for every single journey, for every single challenge
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.240]   we face, we have peace in the form of that shepherd king
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.800]   who leads us through valleys, through,
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.640]   remember through the valleys,
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.000]   valleys aren't permanent, he is.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   The trials will come, no one's immune from that,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.760]   but our peace in Jesus is already here.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.280]   And it will, I promise you this,
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.800]   it will long outlast any set of obstacles
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.480]   that's in front of us now.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:58.600]   So hold on to the gift of Advent, to the gift of peace.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.000]   For those of us here today who are just worn down
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.640]   because it's been a challenging,
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.240]   it's been a really challenging three years,
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.760]   hold on to your peace.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.800]   To those of us who are looking for employment,
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.960]   hold on to your peace.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.240]   For those of us in broken relationships
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.080]   and families that have odd dynamics
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.520]   and things are extremely challenging,
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.840]   hold on to your peace.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.560]   For those of us who are in need, hold on to your peace.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.400]   For those of us who don't know how do we operate
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.920]   in a future version of Hong Kong
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.720]   that's changing geopolitically or through this COVID thing,
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.120]   hold on to your peace.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.680]   Hold on to your peace in your moments of darkness.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.480]   Hold on to your peace in your moments of trials.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.160]   Hold on to your peace when you're broken
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.400]   and when you're frustrated and when you're angry.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.160]   And very soon you'll realize that it's actually your peace
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.280]   that's holding onto you.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.520]   Your peace is holding onto you.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.760]   Hold on to your peace.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.960]   This Advent season, I wonder where God is showing you
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.200]   and me areas that we need to invite his peace
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.680]   to rule and reign again in our lives.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.880]   What are the areas of struggle?
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.120]   If we were to be honest, where are the areas of doubt,
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.240]   of frustration and of confusion,
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.000]   where things are hurt, the sore subjects,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.840]   the things we don't tell anyone about?
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.720]   God is asking us to think about those places,
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.960]   bring them back to mind for each of us
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.000]   and invite his peace to reign there.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.320]   There is no hopelessness when you have this shepherd.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.160]   Your despair doesn't win when you have this shepherd.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.920]   It's available to us now, his peace.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.280]   And we don't have to go looking for it.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.800]   It's chosen to come and be with us.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.400]   We can sit in this tension of already,
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.720]   'cause peace is here, but not yet,
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.000]   'cause everything isn't perfect.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.400]   Knowing that peace has come,
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.920]   but there's a promise of better days
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.280]   where peace will also come.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:07.000]   Where peace will be, where peace will cease
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.520]   all of our oppression, all of the darkness,
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.080]   all of the frustration, all of the things that ail us.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.680]   Where darkness and sin will be forever vanquished.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.120]   There's this beautiful picture
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.040]   at the end of our scriptures in Revelation,
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.280]   where the only reality that we have is shalom,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.680]   is that rest, is that wholeness, is that restoration.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.240]   And I believe God is wanting us to take some time
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.040]   during this Advent season and speak peace
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.960]   and release peace to remember
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.800]   that his peace is available to us.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.840]   So as the band comes up, can we all stand?
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.000]   I know we've done this already today,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.920]   but if you'll just open your hands,
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.920]   just open your hands.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.760]   If you are in need of peace in any area of your life,
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.120]   if there's any area where you feel like
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.760]   you are lacking peace, we serve a God who doesn't lack.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.680]   He'll give you abundantly more.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.200]   If there are any areas that you are confused
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.760]   and you need his peace that passes all understanding,
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.200]   it's available to you.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.800]   And if you're in need of peace,
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.160]   you can just open your hands.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.680]   If you're in need of peace,
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:17.160]   that passes all understanding, it's available to us now.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.040]   So Jesus, we come before you knowing who you are.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.040]   You're not just a baby born 2000 plus years ago.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.720]   You're not just God with us,
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.680]   but because you're God with us, you shepherd us.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.360]   And the way that you shepherd us and rule us
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.240]   brings us shalom and brings us peace.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.880]   You are all that we need, God.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.240]   So we just call upon your spirit now
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.560]   to start doing what only your spirit can do
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.280]   in that loving, kind, compassionate, shepherd way
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.880]   without condemnation, but with restoration in mind.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.480]   Will you bring your peace into our lives, oh God?
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.360]   Will you speak your peace over our situations,
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.480]   over our fears, over the darkest areas of our lives,
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.840]   over the things where we feel like
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.440]   we've run out of hope, Lord.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.400]   Will you be our hope?
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.360]   Will you speak your peace to us again, God?
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.360]   Will you remind us that you are peace,
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.200]   that your spirit makes it well,
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.400]   that if you are there, we can go another day,
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.920]   that if you are there, we can take another step.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:28.360]   Lord, speak to us, show us what areas
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.600]   we need to surrender to your peace, God.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.000]   And may we be a people very much present in this world,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.160]   but ruled by your peace, living securely,
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.200]   living confidently, living on purpose.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:49.320]   We thank you for that, in Jesus' name.
