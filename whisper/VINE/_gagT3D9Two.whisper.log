[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Look, I know what you are thinking.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.160]   This is not Andrew.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.840]   You are not wrong.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.080]   For those of you that don't know me, I'm John.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.080]   I'm one of the founding pastors of the Vine Church.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.400]   But I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say how greatly we have been blessed and more
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.960]   particularly personally challenged by this amazing series.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.840]   I feel humbled and honored to be here today and pray I can do the subject justice.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.360]   And a big shout to those of you who are watching this online as well.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:57.680]   As we see Andrew in Egypt in a moment, we will have a chance to view one of the only
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.840]   remaining of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.780]   But what we will also get is a perspective of the power and the wisdom and the strength
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.680]   of the Egyptians.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:24.500]   So what we'll see is his worldly power and worldly wisdom and worldly strength.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.180]   But can I say impressive nonetheless.
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.660]   So without further ado, let's go over to Pastor Andrew in Giza.
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:54.340]   [Music]
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.660]   There is nothing more iconic of ancient civilization in Egypt than the great pyramids of Giza.
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.360]   These monumental tombs were constructed some four and a half thousand years ago, each taking
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.660]   around 20 years to complete using an estimated 100,000 skilled workers.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.940]   The project was begun by Pharaoh Khufu in 2550 BC and his great pyramid is the largest
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.420]   in Giza, towering some 481 feet above the plateau.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.660]   These pyramids are made of local limestone and the outsides were so highly polished that
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.980]   the stones would sparkle in the sunlight, making the pyramids shine like a huge jewel.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.560]   On a clear day, they can be seen from as far away as modern day Israel.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:47.500]   They were and still are a powerful declaration of ancient Egypt's brilliance, power, and beliefs.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.660]   Belief was indeed one of the primary driving forces behind why these pyramids were constructed
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.660]   in the first place.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.660]   You see, ancient Egyptian pharaohs believed that they would become gods in the afterlife
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.940]   and so they filled their burial tombs with the things that they would want in the afterlife,
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.220]   things like jewelry and art and goods and food and gold.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.780]   And so contrary to what people often think, these pyramids actually tell us more about
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.420]   Egyptian life than they do about Egyptian death.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.180]   And it's this brilliance of Egyptian life that the pyramids really reveal to us when
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:30.980]   we get up and close and personal to them.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.180]   I mean to be here and actually to be standing amongst these incredible structures, I mean
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.780]   it truly is a breathtaking experience.
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.520]   The scale and the scope of these structures is unparalleled in the ancient world.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.980]   And when you begin to understand some of the facts behind how the ancient Egyptians actually
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.660]   constructed the pyramids, I mean you truly become in awe of what those ancient people
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.620]   actually achieved.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.180]   Take for example the engineering precision of these pyramids long before modern day technology.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.940]   Each of the pyramids' sides rise at an angle of 51 degrees 52 inches and are perfectly
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.780]   accurately orientated to the four cardinal points of the compass.
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.660]   They are in fact the most accurately aligned structures in existence, facing true north
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.140]   with only a 360th of degree of error.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.460]   Not only this, but they are located at the intersection of the longest lines of longitude
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.860]   and latitude, meaning they sit at the exact center of the earth's landmass.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.980]   Just stop for a moment and reflect upon that achievement.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.140]   I mean in order for the ancient Egyptians to actually get the accuracy of the placement
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.660]   of the pyramids so correctly, they would have had to have had advanced knowledge of such
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.940]   things like the form and the shape and the weight of the earth, its relationship and
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.900]   distance to the sun, things like the actual length of the solar year, the number of years
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.520]   that are in the precessional cycle, the average temperature of the habitable world, and so
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.740]   many cosmical facts and mathematic formulas that actually weren't going to be invented
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.780]   for centuries to come.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.300]   I mean how the heck did they actually manage to do it?
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.740]   Well scientists and engineers are no closer to discovering today some four and a half
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.980]   thousand years later.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.820]   The brilliance is seen not just in the engineering or the placement of the pyramids, but actually
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.540]   in the very building blocks themselves.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.060]   All 2.3 million building blocks had to be individually prepared, individually cut, then
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.660]   transported, brought here, lifted, placed into the pyramid in exactly the right place
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.260]   where it needed to go.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.100]   And the thing that blows my mind is that actually when you look at the average distance between
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.640]   every single building block on a pyramid like this, the average distance is just 0.5 millimeters
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.640]   in width.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.180]   I mean the accuracy of that just blows my mind.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.980]   But to show us something that any of us who live in a hot climate would deeply appreciate,
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.340]   I actually need to take us inside the pyramid itself.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:19.580]   Come with me.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.940]   Say hello to the most effective air conditioning system in the world.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.540]   Here's the crazy thing, despite the amount of heat that's pounding down on the outside
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.040]   of these structures right now, inside the pyramids the average temperature has never
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.820]   gone above 20 degrees centigrade.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.940]   Never.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.100]   And here's the crazy thing, 20 degrees centigrade is the average temperature of the earth.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.900]   Now how the Egyptians ever knew that, I have no idea.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.500]   But even this is not the most amazing fact about the pyramids.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.120]   There's one more thing that really blows my mind.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.700]   And to tell you about that, unfortunately, I now need to take you back upside to the
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.140]   heat.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.380]   If I was to ask you how many sides the great pyramids of Giza has, you'd say four, just
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.380]   like me.
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.900]   Well, actually we would be wrong.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.540]   There's not four sides to these pyramids, there's actually eight.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.940]   And here's how it works.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.820]   The ancient Egyptians, when they built these, they built them with slight, from bottom to
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.740]   tip, slight concave indentations in each side of the pyramid.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:27.580]   And those concaves are only viewed at certain times within certain lights of the year.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.980]   Now here's the thing that really, really is incredible.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:36.060]   They built something into these pyramids that no one in their lifetime would ever actually
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.380]   be able to see.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.100]   And that's because you can only view the eight sides when you're looking down directly from
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100]   above.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.380]   And of course, no one in ancient Egypt would ever be able to be up and above the pyramids
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.940]   looking down on them.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.100]   So the question we have to ask is, why did they even bother to do that in the first place?
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.740]   Why did they create such a unique thing in the engineering and in the design that no
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.780]   one in their time would ever view?
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:06.780]   Well maybe the answer is, just simply because they could.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.620]   I think it's fair to say that these pyramids are a true human miracle, a testament to the
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.220]   brilliance of the Egyptian civilization.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.900]   And when you're sitting here and you're a part of it and you experience it, you can
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.900]   truly understand why Moses was so terrified to oppose them.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.740]   I mean, how could a shepherd with a lisp stand against a civilization that could do this?
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:44.260]   Well, the answer to that is found in what we see God do next.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.580]   Life is not always fair.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:56.020]   For his part of the talk, Andrew got to go to Egypt.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:11.820]   For my part, I got to go to Legoland.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:19.420]   My nine-year-old grandson, Angus, put this together for me.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:31.380]   But the fact that even this is not your run-of-the-mill Lego model, it's described as an adult architectural
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.500]   model.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:39.460]   On the cover, age 18 plus.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.700]   It gets me how they think that someone who's 19 can actually build it quite easily.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.220]   Someone who's 17 is obviously too young.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.380]   And it was over 1,500 pieces.
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:10:00.380]   It just reinforces Andrew's observations that the amazing background to the pyramids and
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:06.260]   the incredible way in which they have been constructed and some fascinating facts about
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:13.380]   them all show how smart, how really smart the Egyptians were.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:22.380]   And how much fear that must have created in Moses.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.660]   But what we're going to see, I'm going to give you a spoiler alert now, is that despite
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:34.700]   all the worldly power and worldly wisdom and worldly strength of the Egyptians at this
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:42.300]   time, God's power is indisputably the greatest power in the world.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:48.020]   And nothing could ever compare.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.540]   But Moses didn't see this.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.620]   By now he was just a shepherd boy.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.860]   And a shepherd boy with a sistama to boot.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:08.020]   He had experienced the great power of the Egyptians when living in Pharaoh's palace.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:13.620]   But by now, this was over 40 years ago.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:25.140]   We saw last week that God shocked Moses by telling him that he, he was God's chosen agent
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.420]   to bring about the exodus.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:35.100]   Predictably Moses said, "Who me?"
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.740]   As Andrew so clearly showed us.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:43.260]   God said, "Yes, you."
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.120]   In chapter 3 we read this, remember it.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.660]   So now go.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.980]   Go!
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:59.020]   I'm sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:04.540]   In the last two weeks Andrew has shown us Moses at the burning bush and God's call on
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:11.580]   his life to partner with him in returning to Egypt and letting his people go.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:20.860]   Moses has had a lot to say about this and feels very inadequate for the task.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:28.800]   And it is this conversation that we now pick up this week as we head into chapter 4.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.740]   As we begin chapter 4 Moses is still stammering.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:40.740]   Then Moses answered, "But behold, they will not believe me.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:47.980]   They will listen to my voice, for they will say, 'The Lord did not appear to you.'
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:56.420]   Then the Lord said to him, 'What is that in your hand?'"
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.420]   Let's stop there.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:03.500]   I guess many of us have felt like Moses.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:12.580]   "Who Me" has been our theme song, probably being paid on repeat.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:17.900]   I know that certainly that was the case 20 years ago when I felt the call of God to pastor
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.020]   this church.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.860]   I had none of the usual qualifications.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.780]   I hadn't been to theological school.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:32.700]   I hadn't pastored a church and I certainly didn't resemble any of the pastors I knew.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.260]   Thank goodness.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.980]   I was just an insurance man.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:49.580]   I joined the insurance industry at 17 from school and that was all I knew.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.660]   Who me?
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.940]   I found myself in a similar position to Moses.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.700]   I would say to myself, "People won't listen to me.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:05.460]   I'm not a real pastor."
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:10.620]   But in the same way, I felt the same question from God.
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:16.940]   "What is in your hand?"
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:24.540]   And Vine Church, this is the same question that God is asking each one of you today.
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:31.820]   "What is it that is in your hand?"
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:38.740]   In my case, I hastily arranged to have a dessert buffet at the Marriott Hotel with Tony Reed,
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:44.620]   who by the way was just an engineer, with our wives.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.860]   And we resolved that together and with God's grace and provision, we might just be able
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.700]   to do this.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.700]   Who me?
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.500]   Yes, you.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:08.140]   God then shows Moses three signs to help him to be able to prove that God is at work in
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:15.860]   this world and is truly the most powerful thing that there is.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:23.100]   The first sign is a staff.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:30.820]   Verse two says, "The Lord says to him, 'What is it that's in your hands?'
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:36.060]   He said, 'A staff.'"
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:44.180]   In the 40 chapters of Exodus, the word "hand" is used 64 times.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.540]   The hand is associated with a person's activity.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:53.820]   It represents what a person does.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:16:02.180]   So how were Moses' hands made ready for the Lord's work?
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:07.740]   For starters, humility.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:13.380]   You see Moses' staff was that of a shepherd.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:22.340]   The Bible tells us in Genesis 46, 34 that every shepherd was an abomination, was repugnant
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.220]   to the Egyptians.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:33.300]   As Moses stood before Pharaoh and all of Egypt, the staff in his hand would be a constant
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:42.020]   reminder of Egypt's total disdain for him because of his vocation.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:50.260]   This in turn would remind him that without God, he could do nothing.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:17:01.180]   Moses, without God's favor, could do nothing to please Egypt with his ever-present reminder
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:07.020]   of his lowly stature grasped in his hand.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:14.620]   In himself, he was an outcast, a person despised and rejected in the world's most dominant
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.620]   nation.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:27.260]   But, I love that word, the most dominant nation in the world would soon learn that there was
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:32.820]   one more powerful.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:42.020]   In Moses' might, the staff was simply that of a lowly shepherd.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:51.620]   However, as the staff of God was used in this man's surrendered hand, the wooden stick became
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:57.740]   a symbol of authority.
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:05.460]   This represents a precious principle regarding how God uses people.
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:11.780]   God used what Moses had in his hand.
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.700]   Moses' years of tending sheep were not useless.
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:25.500]   Those years had put into Moses' hand the thing he could use for God's glory.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.500]   I love this.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.180]   I'll put this up on the screen for you.
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:35.700]   God did not use the scepter that was in Moses' hand, in his royal hand when he was in the
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:47.540]   palace, but he did use a simple shepherd's staff.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:59.100]   Church, God loves to use what is in our hands.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.620]   Just look throughout the Bible.
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:09.140]   God used what was in Shamgar's hand, what we call a cow prodder, a cow prodder to kill
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.620]   600 Philistines.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:20.780]   God used what was in David's hands, five stones in a sling to kill Goliath.
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:28.840]   God used the jawbone of a donkey in Samson's hand to slay a thousand men.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:37.820]   God used five loaves and two small fish in the hands of a little boy to feed 5,000 men,
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.020]   plus women and children.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.980]   Again, the words of the Psalmist ring true.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:50.940]   Psalm 62, 11 says this, "One thing God has spoken, two things have I heard.
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:56.540]   Power belongs to you, God."
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:04.500]   So after Moses' humility came his obedience.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:10.940]   Verse three says this, "And he said, 'Throw it into the ground.'"
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.220]   Look what happened next.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:19.540]   So he threw it in the ground and it became a serpent and Moses ran from it.
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.140]   I'm not surprised, would you?
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.900]   We all run from it, right?
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.180]   It became a serpent and Moses ran from it.
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:32.020]   But the Lord said to Moses, "Put out your hand and catch it by the tail."
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.180]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.460]   Church don't miss this.
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.900]   This is very, very, very dangerous.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:49.620]   I don't know if we have any snake charmers here, but any trained expert snake charmer
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:58.460]   would take up the serpents by the neck so that they might not be able to bite him.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:05.100]   Moses was encouraged to show his trust in God by taking the serpent up from the tail.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.580]   Yeah, right.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:14.940]   His courage as well as his faith is shown in his ready obedience.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:21.060]   Now this ties in beautifully with what Andrew said last week about God's promises inviting
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:29.540]   us into being active partners in the three areas of obedience, trust, and faith.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.620]   So this is what happened.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:37.300]   So he put his hand out and caught it.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.900]   And it became a staff in his hand.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:45.700]   I'm not demonstrating this one, by the way.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:53.460]   Thus Moses' initial fear was compounded by the command to grab it by the tail, an action
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.580]   that could easily result in a fatal strike.
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:05.500]   But Moses obeyed the word of the Lord, overcoming his fear, and the snake returned to a staff
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.220]   in his hand.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:16.020]   The second sight was Moses' hand.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.900]   Now Moses' hand wasn't bitten off by the snake, right?
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.620]   So it's still there.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.780]   It was the subject of the second sign.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.780]   Let's read it.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.380]   "Again the Lord said to him, 'Put your hand inside your cloak.'
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.140]   And he put his hand inside his cloak.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.700]   And when he took it out, behold, it was leprous like snow.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.540]   And the Lord said, 'Put your hand back inside your cloak.'
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.400]   So he put his hand back inside his cloak.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:52.700]   And when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh."
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:59.860]   After Moses' humility and obedience came his righteousness.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:08.380]   Putting his hand inside his cloak was symbolic of Moses putting his hand over his heart.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:14.100]   The heart represents what a person is and what he speaks.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:19.220]   As I said earlier, the hand is associated with a person's activity.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.100]   It represents what the person does.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:28.780]   The Hebrew word for leprosy here covered a number of assorted diseases, much as our word
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.900]   cancer does today.
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:40.820]   When Moses pulled his leprous hand out of the cloak, it showed him that because man's
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:47.040]   heart is evil, so too will be the work of his hands.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:53.580]   But when Moses returned the second time, returned his hand and it was clean, it signified that
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:58.820]   his hand that holds God's stuff must be cleansed.
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:06.500]   A cleansing evidenced by a clean heart.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:12.900]   Over the past few weeks, we've been looking at the personal journey that Moses has been
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.500]   on the level of his identity and what he thought about himself.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:25.220]   The naked and unashamed invitation by God at the burning bush to come just as he is
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.620]   to receive healing and acceptance.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:44.400]   Now with a pure heart and a pure hand, the Lord is saying, "Take my stuff and do my work."
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.760]   Each of the first two signs had to do with transformation.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:56.960]   Something good and useful, a rod or a hand, was made into something evil, a serpent or
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.740]   a leprous hand.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:04.600]   And significantly, they were transformed back again.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.440]   There was a real message in these first two signs.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:15.220]   The first said, "Moses, if you obey me, your enemies will be powerless."
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:24.120]   The second said, "Moses, if you obey me, your pollution can be made pure."
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.440]   Doubts in each of these areas probably hindered Moses.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:37.340]   And before these signs spoke to anyone else, they spoke to Moses.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:43.960]   This is a pattern with all of us who call ourselves followers of God.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:50.620]   Let me remind you, Andrew has been saying repeatedly that this Exodus series has been
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:57.960]   primarily about your personal Exodus, perhaps even more than the wonderful passage to freedom
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.560]   of the Israelites.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:11.000]   What is saying to us today, right here, right now, obedience.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.820]   Obedience is the key to your personal Exodus.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.520]   Obedience is the key to your personal Exodus.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.640]   Obedience will nullify your enemies.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.000]   Obedience will purify your heart.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.560]   Obedience is your key to deliverance.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:39.260]   The characteristics of humility, obedience, and righteousness that were necessary for
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.560]   Moses are the same for us today.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:54.920]   However, the foolishness of a shepherd's staff used to deliver people has been transformed
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.880]   into the foolishness of a cross.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:05.600]   Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 1.18, "For the message of the cross is foolishness to
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:15.920]   those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:22.160]   On to the third sign, and the third sign was water into blood.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.360]   Let's read it.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:30.040]   If they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, you should take some
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.280]   water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:40.000]   And the water that you should take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.200]   My friends, the third sign was of a different nature.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.320]   The third sign was simply a sign of judgment.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:58.000]   Good, pure waters were made foul and bloody by the word of God, and they did not turn
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   back again.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.580]   Notice that.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:07.020]   This showed that if the miracles of transformation did not turn the hearts of the people, then
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.400]   perhaps the sign of judgment would.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:17.480]   The Bible tells us if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice,
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:25.400]   shows that the sign of judgment was only given when unbelief persisted in the face of the
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.160]   miracles of transformation right before them.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:39.440]   Now the power of Moses to turn the water of the great Nile into blood should be understood
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:47.140]   in the light of the status held by that river in the Egyptian culture.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.560]   The river Nile was honored as divine.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:55.000]   It was a god.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:04.320]   Its waters were held to be the source of all that was good and desirable in Egyptian life.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:10.120]   In a word, it was an idol.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:19.300]   Through Moses, God showed his power and superiority over the pagan gods of Egypt.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:27.340]   As an aside, it demonstrates the need for us to remove all the idols from our life as
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.500]   we work through our personal exodus.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:38.220]   And our idols, as Andrew's told us, can include seemingly good things like our job, our family,
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.920]   our financial security.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:48.360]   It was also a forerunner to the first great plague that we will see later this year in
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.040]   Exodus 7.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.880]   Now the signs may have convinced Israel.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.920]   They didn't convince Moses.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:06.240]   Or at least Moses was not ready to yield yet.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.000]   Look at this in verse 10.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:17.560]   But Moses said to the Lord, "Oh my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:26.040]   you have spoken to your service, but I am slow of speech and of tongue."
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.760]   God's answer to this is astonishing and in a way incomprehensible.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.800]   Verse 11, "The Lord said to him, 'Who has made man's mouth?
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.120]   Who makes him mute or deaf or seeing or blind?
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.160]   Is it not I, the Lord?'"
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:51.400]   My friends, this is a dramatic statement, revealing the sovereignty of God and God revealed
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:58.080]   it in the context of an invitation to trust God and to work with him.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.880]   Now we might feel that Moses had every right to expect healing.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.840]   We believe that healing is included in the atonement.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.800]   Not only does God not give healing to Moses, but he actually seems to take responsibility
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.000]   for the defect.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.480]   God knew as well as Moses that sickness and death, including Moses' impediment, were a
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.720]   result of the fall.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.620]   What God seems to be saying to Moses is the same thing he said to Paul when the apostle
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:35.320]   prayed for the removal of his thorn in the flesh.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:46.680]   "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:53.000]   But this only leads to another round of punches between God and Moses.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.160]   As you know, always wins, right?
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:05.200]   God says, "Therefore go, I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak."
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.280]   Moses, don't you love this guy?
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:17.320]   "Oh Lord, please send someone else."
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.160]   Do you recognize those words?
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.560]   Yeah?
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.500]   I do.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:31.840]   Every time I get an incoming call from my funeral director friend, Car, from White Lily,
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:38.880]   my heart goes in my mouth, telling me that someone has passed away.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.740]   Maybe someone old, maybe someone very young.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:48.660]   Maybe dying after a long illness, maybe a suicide.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.840]   I know what's coming next.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.520]   Can you possibly take the funeral?
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:33:00.800]   And oh, can you go and visit the family?
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.400]   Who me?
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.640]   Is there no one else?
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:13.220]   M'siqw'an dawah.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:18.200]   Moses now shows his true colors.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:24.180]   His problem wasn't a lack of ability.
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.520]   It was a lack of willingness.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:39.940]   If you want to know how to enrage God, practice these words, "Send someone else."
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:47.300]   We read verse 14, "Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against him."
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:52.140]   God wasn't angry when Moses said, "Who am I?"
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:57.180]   God wasn't angry when Moses asked, "Who shall I say sent me?"
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:02.180]   He was not angry when Moses disbelieved God's word and said, "They won't believe me or listen
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.020]   to my voice."
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:12.620]   He was not even angry when Moses falsely claimed that he was not and had never been eloquent.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:21.100]   But God was angry when Moses was just plain unwilling.
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:28.060]   The basic truth is that Moses was unwilling and not unable.
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.340]   This leads us to a fascinating few verses.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.100]   I want to read them as a chunk here.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.100]   I love this.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:38.900]   "Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said, 'Is not Aaron your brother,
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.300]   the Levite?
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.540]   I know that he can speak well.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:47.820]   Behold, he is coming out to meet you and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:52.700]   You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth and I will be with your mouth and
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.260]   with his mouth and I will teach you both what to do.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:03.460]   He shall speak for you to the people and he shall be your mouth and you shall be as God
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.460]   to him.'"
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:10.700]   Now at first sight, it seems that God is helping Moses out.
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.340]   "Ah, don't worry bud.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.740]   I understand how you feel.
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.820]   I'll get your bro, Aaron, to help you."
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:24.700]   Now he's a real talker.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:28.340]   But we've been missing the point.
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:36.180]   When God brought Aaron to help lead with Moses, it was an expression of his chastening to
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.260]   Moses.
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.860]   Not of his approval or giving in to Moses.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:46.300]   Aaron was often more of a problem to Moses than a help.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:52.140]   In Exodus 32, it was Aaron that instigated the worship of the golden calf.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.420]   He fashioned the calf himself and built the altar himself.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:02.120]   In Leviticus, Aaron's son blasphemed God with impure offerings.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:10.220]   In Numbers 12, Aaron led an open mutiny against Moses.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:22.180]   As these episodes unfolded, Moses surely looked back at why God gave Aaron to Moses as a partner.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:26.740]   Because God was angry at Moses' unwillingness.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:33.020]   Now Aaron might have been a smooth talker, but a man weak on character.
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:37.380]   Moses had to put the words of God into the mouth of Aaron.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:43.300]   You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.460]   Now don't get me wrong here.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.500]   Let's put this in context.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:52.980]   We shall see that there were times when Aaron was an incredible help to Moses and was in
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.820]   his own way a great servant of God despite his faults.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:03.900]   When we get to Exodus 17, we'll see Aaron and her just faithfully lifting Moses' hands
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.500]   during the battle, the Israelites' battle against the Amalekites.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:13.060]   But let's go back to Exodus 4.
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.900]   The revelation ends.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.900]   This is great, I love this.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:24.460]   With God reminding Moses about his staff.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.780]   I don't know if there's any irony in God's reminder.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.180]   As if he wants to say, "Don't forget your stick."
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:44.540]   Verse 17, end of the chapter, "And take in your hands this staff with which you will
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:49.060]   do the signs."
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:56.560]   As we conclude, I want us to see this story as an encouragement.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:04.580]   When God calls us in life, whether that's in a marketplace position, in a family, in
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:13.260]   relationships, in whatever sphere of influence we have, he always equips us through his miraculous
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.500]   and awesome power.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:21.060]   We don't see staffs turning into snakes these days.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.840]   But what we do see is God changing people's hearts.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.760]   We do see him anointing us beyond our gifting.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:37.540]   We do see him creating favour we don't deserve and opening doors that we never thought could
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.700]   open.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:48.540]   In the same way that God said to Moses, "What is in your hand?"
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:56.500]   So God says to us, "What is it I've given you?
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.700]   What is it I've equipped you with?
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.140]   I've gifted to you?
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:13.500]   Those are the things that through my Spirit can become the sign to others that I am the
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:18.660]   one true God."
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.500]   What we're going to do in a moment is something special.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.980]   Very simple ministry time.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:28.500]   I'm going to be asking you to stand in a few moments.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.340]   Very simple, I'm going to ask you to hold your hands out.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:42.020]   Now before you do that, am I giving you everything, Lord?
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:45.620]   Am I holding something back?
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:50.540]   You say to me, "I'm not very gifted."
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:56.140]   Whatever you've got, put it in your hands.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:03.420]   We as a church are going to stand before God and we're going to ask for his Holy Spirit
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.700]   to anoint those things.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:13.700]   I believe that as we do so, God is going to do in your life more than you could even
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.320]   imagine.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:20.660]   In the life of this church, in this city, more than we could imagine if we would only
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:26.940]   offer him what is in our hands.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:36.300]   But before we do that, I'm going to ask everyone to close their eyes for a moment.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:40.780]   I'm very conscious there may be people in here, and there certainly were at the first
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:48.780]   service who haven't yet put your life in the hands of Jesus.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:54.980]   You haven't surrendered your life to him.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:41:03.860]   I'm going to give you an opportunity to say to him, "Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.860]   I believe you died upon the cross.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:10.020]   Would you forgive my sins and come into your life?
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.020]   Come into my life?"
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:18.860]   I'm just going to allow a moment as God speaks to you now.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:24.860]   If you need to make that step this morning, I'm going to pray for you and we as a church
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.580]   are going to support you.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:32.820]   Or maybe once upon a time you were walking with God, maybe as a young person, you don't
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.020]   actually know why you're in church today, but something's brought you here.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.340]   Maybe a friend's brought you here.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.900]   You've wandered a long way away from God.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.620]   Today is the day when you say, "God, I'm coming back to you.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:52.780]   Jesus, come into my life again."
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:57.780]   Church, this is potentially the most important time of someone's life.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:03.580]   Let's respect this by keeping our eyes closed.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:09.620]   And if you're that person or those people and you want to use this opportunity to give
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:18.940]   your life to Jesus Christ right here, right now, I'd love to pray for you.
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:23.380]   I'm going to ask you to do one very, very simple thing just so I know who I'm praying
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:27.380]   for.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:32.620]   Could you, Roswa, with every eye closed, could you just raise your hand so I can see?
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.500]   Do you want to give your life to Jesus?
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.740]   Thank you, sir.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.740]   Thank you.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.940]   Anyone up in the balcony?
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.060]   Thank you, I see that hand there.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.100]   I'll give you just a moment.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.660]   I see that hand at the back.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.100]   Don't be shy, just raise it a bit higher.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.100]   Come on, it's good.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:02.020]   It's a good time to do it because we're going to pray for you.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.020]   I'm not going to make you feel embarrassed.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:09.660]   I'm going to just pray for you.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:17.500]   I think it is upon us as a church to really spend just a moment for those people who've
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.140]   raised their hands.
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:25.140]   We never know why someone is raising their hand, but that is a step of faith.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:29.300]   And for those people who've raised their hands, we have people here afterwards who will pray
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.460]   with you and encourage you.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.300]   But just for the benefit of those raising their hands, I just see another hand go up
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.300]   over there.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.140]   Thank you very much.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:45.380]   Would you all pray this prayer with me for the benefit of those people as we welcome
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.100]   in the kingdom?
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.860]   Repeat after me, "Dear Jesus."
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.500]   I think that was a little bit shy, everyone, by the way.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:03.820]   Dear Jesus, I thank you that you died for me.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.740]   I recognise I am a sinner.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.980]   I'm in need of forgiveness.
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:13.140]   Jesus, I believe you're the Son of God.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:26.620]   Jesus, I ask you now to forgive my sins and come into my life and fill me with your Spirit.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:39.100]   Lord Jesus, I know now that I am yours and that I will spend eternity with you and my
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.900]   brothers and sisters.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.420]   I pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.420]   Amen.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:50.740]   Let's welcome the people who've prayed that prayer.
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:45:02.700]   Let's all stand.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.100]   Just take a moment.
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:12.660]   When I ask you the question, "What is in your hands?"
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:16.420]   Don't tell me I'm not as gifted as that person over there.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:24.220]   It's not time to run around and Lord, send somebody else.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.140]   Just put your hands out in front of you.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:34.900]   All across the church, this is amazing.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.580]   This is an act of faith.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:42.060]   Saying Lord, all I have is yours.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.340]   I may not have very much, Lord, but what I have, will you use it?
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:52.860]   And I pray, Holy Spirit, you'll come upon your church.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.860]   Fill this church.
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:46:03.060]   Lord, take these hands which are surrendered to you and multiply the gifts and use the
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:10.860]   gifts Lord, for the benefit of others, for the benefit of this city, for this nation.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:20.340]   Lord, you used a little boy who was a shepherd boy, he wasn't little at the time, he was
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:24.460]   lowly to bring about your exodus.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:34.940]   I'm going to pray that God will give you courage.
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.340]   Courage is the word I have.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:41.020]   That God, by your Holy Spirit, will you just give us courage.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:47.140]   Will you give us courage tomorrow when we go into our workplace?
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:48.140]   Will you give us courage?
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:55.060]   When we go out to dim sum today with our unsaved family friends?
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:47:02.180]   Will you give us courage on the streets of Hong Kong?
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.180]   We are believing, Lord.
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.940]   This is a significant time for our city.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:28.300]   Holy Spirit, fill me afresh.
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:36.980]   I need you.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:49.340]   There's a tremendous sense of God's presence in this place.
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:54.020]   Let's not move from there quickly.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:59.420]   His hand is upon you.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.660]   See His hand upon this lady over here.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:07.500]   This gentleman here.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.300]   God wants to take what is in your hand.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.620]   Change a city.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.700]   Change a nation.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.020]   Who, me?
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.020]   Yes, you.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:27.020]   Thank you, Lord.
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.540]   Let's release ourselves in worship now, say.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.540]   Amen.
