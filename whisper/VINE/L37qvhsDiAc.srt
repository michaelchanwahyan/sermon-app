1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Amen. Thank you, Francesca.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 It's so good to see you all.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Now, I want to share with you about an experience I had about 10 years ago.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 I took a Christmas Bible quiz and I got a really low score.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 So this was a little bit traumatizing for me.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 So I had a lot of sleepless nights.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I woke up, there was tears in my eyes thinking of it.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 But my score was, I was really shocked at how much details of the Christmas story I got wrong.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 So I thought it would be fun this morning to do a little Christmas Bible quiz.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 So are you ready for that?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Come on.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I told you I got a bad score.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 So you're set up for success.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Okay, so here's the first question.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Jesus was born in a stable.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 True or false?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 If you think it's true, raise your hand.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Okay, the answer is false.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 The Bible actually doesn't say where Jesus was born.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 So that's the first one.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 All right, second one.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 There were three wise men who brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 True or false?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 True.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Okay.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 So that is also false because it doesn't mention that there was three wise men.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Good job.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 You did good.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 That was good.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 The next one.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 What animal did Mary ride on during the journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem?

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Was it a donkey?

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Was it a mule, a horse, or does the Bible not say?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So if you think it was a donkey, raise your hand.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 If you think it was a mule, if you think it was a horse, I'm the only one who thinks it's a horse, okay.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Or the Bible does not say.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 The Bible does not say.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Mary probably walked.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 See, I'm serious.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 But a Christmas place always have a donkey or a mule in there, right?

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Okay, and here's the fourth one, last one.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 This is the last one.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Where did the Magi from the East meet Jesus?

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Was it in a cave, in a manger, in a house, or the Bible does not say?

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 So the first one is cave.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Okay, the second one is the manger.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Okay, we got a few.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 The house.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And then the last one, the Bible does not say.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Okay.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So the Magi met Jesus in a house.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Because they actually came almost two years after Jesus was born.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And so Joseph and Mary were living in a house.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Matthew 2.11, you can look it up.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So, okay, I'm curious.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Who got two or more right?

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 How about three or more?

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 What about four out of four?

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Okay, we have one person.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Congratulations.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 We have a Bible scholar among us.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 This is great.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So why am I doing this Christmas quiz?

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Well, what I wanted to highlight through my own experience, but also I think through our experience right now here together is that our knowledge from Christmas about Jesus, it comes from pop culture, from Christmas plays, from tradition, but not really from the biblical account.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And so what happens over time is that these traditions, they have made Jesus into someone he is not really.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 They made him meek and mild.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He's baby Jesus.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And it's like I call it the tamed Jesus.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 It's not the Jesus of scripture.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Where all the rough edges, all the things that might challenge us, they're, what do you call it, sanded off.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And so it's this Jesus that we hear and learn about in pop culture, but it's not really who Jesus is.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And what I want to do with you today is I want to take you to some of the birth narratives of Jesus where we can get a glimpse of the real Jesus, the untamed Jesus, the Jesus that has the power to change people's lives.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 The Jesus that has the power to turn our lives around and the Jesus that speaks authoritatively yet lovingly into our lives and has something to say to us.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And so we're continuing in our message today.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The message series Christmas.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I hope you've been enjoying it.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Have you been enjoying it?

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Has been good?

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Yes.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Okay.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 I think it's been great.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I've been enjoying it.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And our topic for today is of signs and swords.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And so to explain who this untamed Jesus is, the real Jesus, I want to take you to the gospel of Luke chapter 2 and starting in verse 25.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 It says this.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon who was righteous and devout.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 He was waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was on him.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Now Luke introduces Simeon as a devout man.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And we see this devotion because Simeon is waiting for the consolation of Israel.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Now what is that?

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 What is the consolation of Israel?

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Well, in the Old Testament, the prophet spoke of a time where things in Israel will be set right, where things in Israel will be restored, where God will bring wholeness to Israel.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So it's also talking about the Messiah, that the Messiah would come, the anointed king, to set things in order.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And Simeon's devotion is showing that he is patiently waiting for that.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 He hasn't given up on that.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 He's an old man at this point in time, but he's patiently waiting.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And when we think about wanting things to happen, I don't know about you, but we live in this immediacy culture, right?

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Where we want things to happen right away.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 We don't want to wait.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 But a lot of times when it comes to the things of God, actually we have to be patient and wait on God's timing.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And so you see Simeon doing this here.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Now another thing we learn about Simeon is that the Holy Spirit was upon him, which is in the Old Testament, of course we're in the New Testament, but it's a way of describing prophets.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 So we should understand Simeon as a prophet.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And what we're about to read are some prophetic things that Simeon is saying.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 But let's continue.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 So verse 27 says this.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 "Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts when the parents brought the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the law required."

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So Simeon had been brought by the Spirit into the temple, so he's being led by God.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Jesus' parents are also shown as being devout, Joseph and Mary, because they're going to the temple, whether it's the eighth day, the naming of Jesus, or whether it's the 40th day of dedicating the firstborn son to God, they're being obedient to God by bringing him to the temple.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Let's continue.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So in verse 28 through 33, it says this.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 "Simeon took him by his arms and praised God, saying, 'Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 From my eyes I have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel.'

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him."

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 So Simeon takes Jesus in his arms.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I always wonder in that scene, does he explain anything, or do they just let him grab the baby?

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 How does that all play out?

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 But he takes Jesus in his arms, and then he starts to speak prophetically over the identity of who Jesus is.

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And he talks about that Jesus will bring salvation.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 He is the consolation of Israel.

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 He is the one who will restore things, renew things, and put things into right order.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 And he is not just doing that for Israel, but he is doing that for all people.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 And so then we are told that Mary and Joseph, when they hear that, they are marveling.

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Just this music through their ears.

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I mean, what incredible words spoken over your child.

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Amazing.

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 But now you are wondering, like, he talked about untamed Jesus.

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Like, so far, things seem the way we probably know them.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 But now we are going to get into the part that a lot of times is skipped or not talked much about.

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And this is the second prophecy of Simeon.

132
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 And that's where we see a more true picture of who Jesus is and how people relate to Jesus.

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 So let's look at that.

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 So up until now, Mary, this was music to her ears.

135
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 But the next words are actually hard.

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Verse 34. Let's continue.

137
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It says, "Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother,

138
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 'This child is destined, the cause of falling and the rising of many in Israel,

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 and to be a sign that people will be spoken against,

140
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed,

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 and a sword will pierce your own soul too.'"

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Wow. What just happened?

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 This was like positive news beforehand, right?

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And now suddenly there's some heavy words spoken over Jesus and over Mary as well.

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 We're not told how Mary responds, but we can only imagine.

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 That's a lot of the process and the take in and try to understand and make sense of.

147
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 So let's unpack the second prophecy.

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Let's take a closer look at what this is talking about and what it means.

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Just to give the big picture, basically this is about the rejection, how people will reject Jesus.

150
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 How there will be some who accept him, but how a lot will reject the salvation that he will bring.

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But let's look a little bit at it in more detail.

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So we're told that Jesus' destiny calls the falling and the rising of many,

153
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 and that he will be a sign that will be spoken against,

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed.

155
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 So whereas the falling and the rising speaks of the falling is rejection, the rising is accepting Jesus.

156
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 But then the second part, the sign that will be spoken against is just rejection.

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 But it also shows how we relate to Jesus, how we treat him,

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 reveals what's in our hearts and how we relate to God, because Jesus is God with us.

159
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Now I want to especially focus on unpacking the imagery of falling and rising,

160
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 which often is used in the New Testament to describe responses to Jesus.

161
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So Simeon is drawing on this familiar image that you find throughout the Old Testament, also the New Testament as well.

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And it's that of a cornerstone that some accept and they receive salvation, and some reject, and it's their stumbling stone.

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 So in Isaiah 8, verse 14, it says this, "He will be a holy place for both Israel and Judah.

164
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 He will be a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.

165
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 And for the people of Jerusalem, he will be a trap and a snare."

166
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Isaiah 28, 16 says this, "So this is what the sovereign Lord says.

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation.

168
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 The one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic."

169
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And then Psalm 118, verse 22, "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone."

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 So the falling and rising response to people reacting to Jesus differently,

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 those who are falling, they are rejecting who Jesus is, and they're not receiving him.

172
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And they ultimately fall, and there is experience of judgment.

173
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And those who are rising are open to Jesus, accept him, place their faith in the cornerstone, and experience salvation.

174
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Now, the reality is we go between rising and falling a lot of times.

175
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 So for example, Apostle Paul, he was falling.

176
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 He was persecuting Christians.

177
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 He was going after them.

178
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 He was even involved, you know, whether actively or just as a bystander, in that way,

179
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 supporting people being Christians being killed.

180
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Stephen, in Acts.

181
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 But then he had a Jesus encounter on the road to Damascus.

182
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And he was blinded, but got God's attention.

183
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And he went from falling to rising and to being open and accepting Jesus

184
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 and being one of the great proclaimers, you know, in early Christian movement of Jesus

185
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 and establishing churches and planting churches.

186
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And so for us, there might also be seasons where we have been open to Jesus

187
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 but never really reached a conclusion about him.

188
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And then where we were rejecting Jesus for a season, and maybe we're open again.

189
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 So we move between this rising and falling.

190
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 But Jesus, he has come to stake out the claim that he is King of kings, Lord of lords.

191
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Jesus polarizes his contemporaries.

192
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 There were those who wanted to kill him, and they eventually did.

193
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 They nailed him to the cross.

194
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And there are those who believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God,

195
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 and who received him as that.

196
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But what you see in the Bible, what you don't see in the Bible,

197
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 is people simply saying, "Oh, he was a good teacher. He was a nice guy."

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 There is not such a mild response to Jesus.

199
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 People react strongly one way or the other to him

200
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 because Jesus did not leave that option open to just treat him as, "Oh, he's a nice guy,"

201
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 with the things that he said, the things that he proclaimed.

202
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 He was polarizing, of course, with a purpose not just to antagonize,

203
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 but because he had come, he was on a rescue mission to save and deliver.

204
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And a lot of times when we need rescuing, we actually need a shaking up,

205
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 otherwise we don't get it.

206
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 So Jesus came to shake things up and to be very clear about who he is.

207
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 The only way to, or if Simeon's prophetic word is correct,

208
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 if Jesus came to polarize people to cause some to rise and some to fall,

209
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 why is it that most people today don't seem to be rising and falling?

210
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Why don't people today have the polarized response to Jesus?

211
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Well, I think for one, if people never have heard of Jesus,

212
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 how can you have a response to it?

213
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 But part of it is what I brought up earlier, where we have tamed Jesus.

214
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 We have a wrong image of who Jesus is, not the real Jesus.

215
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And that Jesus is fiction.

216
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 They have come to believe in a version of Jesus,

217
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 one that Christmas plays and traditions and pop culture give us.

218
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 People only want to believe that Jesus was a nice guy, a good teacher,

219
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 and a man with moral principles.

220
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 We try to make Jesus into something we can manage,

221
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 that fits neatly into our lives, so that we can be in control

222
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 and just call him when we need him,

223
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 but not deal with Jesus at another point in time.

224
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 We don't really want to deal with Jesus' claims about his identity.

225
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 We want Jesus on our terms.

226
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 This is true for Christians as well, whether you're a Christian or not a Christian.

227
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Everybody does this at one point or another.

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 But there is no historical evidence of a Jesus that was just a good teacher.

229
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 The Bible gives us a different picture.

230
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 There is a famous Oxford scholar from the 20th century called C.S. Lewis,

231
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 and he has a quote that I want to read to you.

232
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 "I'm trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing

233
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 that people often say about him.

234
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher,

235
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 but I don't accept his claims to be God.

236
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 That is the one thing we must not say.

237
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things that Jesus said

238
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 would not be a great moral teacher.

239
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 He would either be a lunatic on the level of the man who thinks he's a poached egg,

240
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 or else he would be the devil of hell.

241
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 You must make your choice.

242
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Either this man was and is the son of God,

243
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 or else a madman or something worse.

244
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 You can't shut him up for a fool.

245
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 You can't spit on him and kill him as a demon,

246
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God.

247
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.

248
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 He has not left that open to us.

249
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 He did not intend to."

250
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 So I wonder if some of us today,

251
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 if we've been preferring this tamed Jesus that C.S. Lewis just talked about is not an option,

252
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 where we keep Jesus at arm's length in our life

253
00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 because we don't really want him to break into lives, to speak into our lives.

254
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 But Jesus, this Jesus is an idol.

255
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 This is not a real thing.

256
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 We create Jesus basically in our own image, the way we want Jesus to be.

257
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 But it's not the Jesus of Scripture,

258
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 not the one who fiercely loves us,

259
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 who lays down his life for us,

260
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 who is worth sacrificing for, giving our lives for.

261
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 But the real Jesus, the untamed Jesus that Simeon profanely spoke of

262
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 causes the falling and rising of people.

263
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 He has the power to transform your life.

264
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 He is the son of God, King of kings and Lord of lords.

265
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 The real Jesus influences our decisions, choices of friends and behavior

266
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 and stirs in us a desire to live sacrificially,

267
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 to contribute to the well-being and flourishing of those around us.

268
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 That's what real Jesus does.

269
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 He speaks powerfully into our lives.

270
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 The real Jesus is worthy of our adoration, worship, obedience and sacrifice.

271
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 He's not a nice to have.

272
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 He's essential. He's King of kings.

273
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 He deserves our worship.

274
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 So accepting Jesus into our lives is not a guarantee of perfect days ahead

275
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 and an easy road in life.

276
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Sometimes we give the impression as pastors

277
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 that if you become a Jesus follower, you will never have a problem again.

278
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Now, Jesus blesses us incredibly and he loves us perfectly.

279
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 But it does not mean that there is not challenges that we face

280
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 or that he allows for us to go through.

281
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 As a Christian, we often find ourselves at a crossroad.

282
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Do we choose comfort and convenience or do we choose obedience to Jesus?

283
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 When you obey Jesus, there might be a cost.

284
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 The loss of money, the loss of a job, the loss of previous plans,

285
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 the loss of reputation, the loss of a relationship.

286
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And Jesus, even today, he speaks challenging things to us,

287
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 calling us to difficult tasks like mediating a conflict

288
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 that you'd rather not get involved in,

289
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 forgiving someone who has hurt you, loving our enemies,

290
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 standing up for something that is not right in your company,

291
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 your organization, and being willing to potentially lose your job,

292
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 leaning into a conflict and working towards reconciliation.

293
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 In a previous role in a church when I was a senior pastor,

294
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 I had a leaders' meeting and somebody just started laying into me,

295
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 "Your sermons suck. Your preaching sucks.

296
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 You're not inspiring. The way you handled it."

297
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 I mean, just went off for 10 minutes and it was so hard.

298
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 I got a little bit defensive because it was so strong.

299
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 I tried not to be, but then other people started getting defensive for me.

300
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And my human reaction, the comfortable reaction would be,

301
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 "Well, if it's so bad, why don't you just leave?"

302
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 But of course that's not what Jesus asked me to do.

303
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 He asked me to lean in, to go to the person,

304
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 to understand what's on the person's heart,

305
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 to communicate that how this person communicated

306
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 was not a way that I could receive it or anyone could receive it,

307
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 and do that hard work. And that was very difficult.

308
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 So Jesus, he calls us to do difficult things, but they are always good.

309
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 When he asks us to do something difficult,

310
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 he is always working through that in us and through it.

311
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Maybe that also means standing up for someone when no one else does.

312
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Giving sacrificially of your time to a person in need,

313
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 even if it's really difficult.

314
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 If Jesus is just at arm's length and nice to have,

315
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 why would you do that?

316
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 If Jesus is your Lord and he asks you to do it, we say, "Yes, Lord."

317
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Or waiting on God to do something that he has promised us,

318
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 and waiting on his timing, and not on our own timing.

319
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Because a lot of times, I mean, I'm the same way.

320
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 I want things to happen right now.

321
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 But sometimes God asks us to wait patiently, to trust him, to rely on him.

322
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 And to just keep coming to him with whatever is going on,

323
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 and asking him for grace and strength.

324
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 And he gives us the grace and strength.

325
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Now, in the early 2000s, I was attending a church.

326
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 I was working at Morgan Stanley. I was a businessman at the time.

327
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And there was three services in a row where they had missionaries share.

328
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And I was so powerful, and I was so moved after every Sunday.

329
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I had tears flowing down my eyes,

330
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 which was not my normal response to a sermon at that time.

331
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 So after the second Sunday, I was like, "Is God trying to tell me something?"

332
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And then on the third Sunday,

333
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I realized that God was calling me to do something else,

334
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 that there was a change of plans,

335
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 and that I needed to act right away.

336
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 So that night, I went into my office.

337
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I cleared out my office.

338
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And then the next day, I went with jeans and a t-shirt to my boss,

339
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 and I told him that God had called me to do something for him,

340
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 and that I had to quit my job.

341
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 To my surprise, my boss commended my courage for doing that.

342
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 He also told me not to show up at a different investment firm anytime soon.

343
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 [laughter]

344
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Because they invested a lot of resources in me,

345
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 with licenses and all that stuff.

346
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Now, this was not what I had planned.

347
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 This was not my plan. I never planned to be a pastor.

348
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Or at that time, I just knew God wanted me.

349
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 I didn't even know exactly what.

350
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And then suddenly, I found myself in this mess,

351
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 because I quit my job.

352
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 I don't know exactly what I'm doing.

353
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I told my parents.

354
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 "Ooooh."

355
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Yeah, my parents, "You make a big mistake. Why didn't you stay there?"

356
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 That's why I didn't ask my parents beforehand,

357
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 because I knew what they would say.

358
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 But my prayer was that they would come around,

359
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 that they would understand,

360
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 that they could see that God had called me.

361
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And then I ended up, in the meantime,

362
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 as I was applying to different roles and things,

363
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I took a job at an old company that worked for a lot lower position.

364
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And I even wondered, "God, did I make a mistake?

365
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Did I hear you wrongly?"

366
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 But I ended up joining Mercy Ships, a medical mission ship.

367
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 I did a discipleship training school with them

368
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 for five months in West Africa.

369
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 They do life-saving surgeries,

370
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 bringing hope and healing through their practical work,

371
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 but also through sharing the gospel.

372
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 I helped out in the finance department and also had that schooling.

373
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And for me, even though it was messy,

374
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 when Jesus calls us to do things, a lot of times they're messy.

375
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 There's a season where stuff gets stirred up,

376
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 but it is always good.

377
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 God always has a good reason and a good purpose for it.

378
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And for me, this was like my key turning point,

379
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 where Jesus set me on a different trajectory,

380
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 because he had different plans for my life

381
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 than I had come up with on my own.

382
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 I wanted to be successful in business.

383
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 My father was successful.

384
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 I wanted to be like him in this way.

385
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 But Jesus had a different plan for me.

386
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 So this is what happens when the real Jesus enters your life

387
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 and is Lord of your life.

388
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 He speaks into your life.

389
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 He calls you to obedience.

390
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 And Jesus comes into our lives and turns things upside down.

391
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 This is messy, but it always is designed to bring life.

392
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Jesus is working out his good purposes in us and through us.

393
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Now, just think also when the Holy Spirit confronts us in sin,

394
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 when he asks us to stop watching pornography

395
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 or to stop cheating on our taxes or whatever it is.

396
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 It's not nice to be confronted in those things.

397
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 It always is messy.

398
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 But when we repent and we do what Jesus asks us to do,

399
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 he brings wholeness.

400
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 He brings life.

401
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 He does something good.

402
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 But that only happens when Jesus is Lord of your life,

403
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 when you give him that space to speak that way into your life.

404
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 But a lot of times we love keeping Jesus at arm's length

405
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 because we want to be in control.

406
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Now, receiving difficult tasks, you know,

407
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 to stand up in your company for something that's wrong

408
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 or to change a career or to lean into a difficult conversation

409
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 with somebody who has not treated you very nicely,

410
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 that's uneasy to get that sort of news and direction.

411
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 It involves not just joy, but there's also some pain in there.

412
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Just imagine how Mary must have felt when Simeon was speaking

413
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 those prophetic words over her and in Jesus.

414
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 He said, "And a sword will pierce your own soul too."

415
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 That is Simeon's prophetic word over Mary.

416
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Now, what does that mean?

417
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Well, it's not a physical sword, but a metaphorical sword

418
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 where she will experience pain because her son Jesus

419
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 is being rejected and because she sees him suffer.

420
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 You know, that's not an easy burden to carry.

421
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 But at the same time, Simeon also had revealed,

422
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 and in other settings as well, that Jesus was the consolation of Israel,

423
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 the Messiah who would bring salvation to all people.

424
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 So even though there is suffering, there is also joy

425
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 in knowing what God is doing.

426
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 And if God calls you to do something,

427
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 he gives you the grace and the strength to do it.

428
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 He never asks you to do something that you cannot do.

429
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 He doesn't set you up for failure.

430
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 He gave Mary the grace and the strength to do it.

431
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 He gave me the grace and strength to do it.

432
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 They go through a messy transition,

433
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 and God will give you the grace and the strength to go through it

434
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 when you are obedient, when he's leading you.

435
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 He will provide for you, and it is always for the good.

436
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 You know, God has good plans and a good purpose for you.

437
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 But if we block him out of our lives or keep him so far away,

438
00:31:49,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 we're keeping Jesus from doing that work in our lives.

439
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 I want to right now invite the worship team to come up.

440
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Now, some of us, you know, we have been keeping Jesus at arm's length.

441
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 We have bought into whether we purposefully wanted to,

442
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 into this tamed Jesus that we can control,

443
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 that is only a nice to have when we need him.

444
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 We call on him like a magic genie, you know,

445
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 help us and give us what we need.

446
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 But we have not surrendered all areas of our lives to Jesus.

447
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 What Jesus deserves are all.

448
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 He wants your whole heart.

449
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 He doesn't just want a little part of your life.

450
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 He wants all of your heart.

451
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 And whatever Jesus does is always for the good.

452
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And so my question is, are you giving him room to speak into your life,

453
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 to speak words of encouragement, to speak words of direction,

454
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 to speak words of correction as well?

455
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Are you giving Jesus that space in your life?

456
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 And when we give Jesus that space in our lives, this is the real Jesus,

457
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 the one who turns our lives around, who takes our broken lives,

458
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 our messy lives, and who turns them into something beautiful,

459
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 who lets us know that he loves us, that he has perfect plans for us,

460
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 and who works them out in our lives in a way we can't even imagine or dream of.

461
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 But it doesn't mean that every part is always easy.

462
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 It does get messy.

463
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 So what I want to do, I want to invite you all to stand.

464
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 And if you, whether it's for the first time or today again,

465
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 want to make yourselves available to Jesus and say,

466
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 "Jesus, I don't want to cut you out of my life or certain parts of my life.

467
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 I want all of you. I want you to speak into my life.

468
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 I want you to mess things up where things need to be shaken up,

469
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 where you have something better than what is there,"

470
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 then I want to encourage you to stretch out your hands,

471
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 and I would just love to pray over you.

472
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 So you stretch out your hands as a symbol of just wanting to receive from Jesus right now.

473
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 "Jesus, I thank you so much that you love us so much that you don't just let us be,

474
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 but that you have come here to reveal who you are so that we can know that you love us.

475
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 You have come to shake us up in areas where we're living in brokenness

476
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 or we're heading in directions where you have something else for us."

477
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 I want to pray right now for those who are stretching out their hands

478
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 that you--yeah, as a surrender to you, Lord, we know that honors you.

479
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Will you meet them? Will you speak words of life, of encouragement, of goodness,

480
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 and direction, correction, whatever it is that they need, that we need, Lord?

481
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 Will you speak those words to us?

482
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And will you shake things up, and will you bring what is good, what is life,

483
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 what is beautiful, because you are working, you are stirring, you're moving.

484
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 And Lord, I ask that you forgive us where we've cut you out of our lives.

485
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Also pray for those who've been struggling with strongholds for a long time,

486
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 where they just seem to not be getting out of patterns of brokenness.

487
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Lord, I pray that in your power and by your name, Jesus, you break chains right now,

488
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 that you break those addictions, that you break those areas where we just keep living in sin,

489
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 that you bring us into your beautiful life, into your holiness, into your righteousness.

490
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 So we thank you, we love you, and we worship you.

491
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 And I pray all this in your name, Jesus. Amen.

492
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
