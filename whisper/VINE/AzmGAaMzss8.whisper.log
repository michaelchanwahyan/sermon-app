[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   Today I wanna speak about reconciliation.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.520]   In simple terms, reconciliation is the process
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.520]   of making two people or groups of people friendly again
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.440]   after they've argued seriously or fought
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.120]   and kept apart from each other.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.560]   But first, let me tell you about Mary Johnson.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.360]   Mary lost her son in 1993 after a then-teenaged O'Shea Israel
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.440]   go into a fight with him at a party in Minneapolis,
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.460]   and he shot him.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.100]   With so many questions unanswered,
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.600]   Mary Johnson went to visit O'Shea in jail.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.880]   After her first contact, she said this,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.840]   "I began to feel this movement in my feet.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   "It moved up my legs.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.640]   "It just moved up my body.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.140]   "When I felt it leave me, I instantly knew
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.040]   "that all hatred and anger and animosity
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.860]   "I had in my heart for you for 12 years was over.
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.640]   "I have totally forgiven you."
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.280]   Unbelievably, the two went on to live as neighbors
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.520]   in the same duplex, and Johnson even referred to Israel
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.240]   as her son in interviews.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.840]   We have a picture of them here.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.480]   Israel told Mary Johnson, "I admire you
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.580]   "for being brave enough to offer forgiveness
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.640]   "and for being brave enough to take that step.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.100]   "It motivates me to make sure
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.340]   "that I stay on the right path."
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.320]   Last year, Mary passed away,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.340]   and Israel served as a pallbearer at her funeral.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.700]   Reconciliation.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.340]   This morning, we come to Genesis 44
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.860]   as we continue through our story, the study of Joseph.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.340]   Not only does the story of Joseph tell us
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.240]   how Israel wound up in Egypt,
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.620]   not only does it tell us how God made this family of Jacob
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.860]   into a great nation in accordance with his promises
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.780]   to Abraham in Genesis 12, 15, and 17,
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.100]   but God also shows us something
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.880]   of his strategy in redemption.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.460]   Redemption with his people to bring blessing
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.940]   where there is alienation,
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.620]   to bring reconciliation where there is intense hostility.
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.280]   Our series has focused on the life of Joseph.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.560]   Joseph began life, as we heard, as a favored son,
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.080]   and in the very context of that rivalry with his brothers,
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   experienced the great humiliation of his life.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.360]   He is sold into slavery.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.220]   He serves well as a servant in the house of Potiphar.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.900]   He finds himself falsely accused
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.360]   and imprisoned in a royal prison.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.380]   He is finally released,
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.180]   and he is made the second-ranking official
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.460]   behind Pharaoh, his prime minister.
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.660]   But just as he has, with his own mouth and heart,
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.060]   uttered these words, look at these.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.240]   God has made me forget my trouble
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.840]   and all my father's household.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.000]   Just as he said that,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.400]   the Lord brings his father's household
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.120]   right into his backyard
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.460]   and begins to do a work that not even Joseph could imagine.
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.360]   And so, as I say, we come now to Genesis 44,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.780]   as Joseph's test reaches its great culmination.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.620]   You remember last week's sermon from Justin.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.020]   Joseph's family had been brought to Egypt
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.220]   because of the famine.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.800]   He had kindly given them grain,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.720]   though he had kept Simeon.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.360]   They had been accused of being spies,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.160]   and as an assurance they would return, Simeon was kept.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.840]   And indeed, they did return as they promised,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.820]   bringing their youngest brother, Benjamin,
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.720]   even though it took a great deal
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.800]   of persuading of Jacob, their father.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.880]   But they did return with Benjamin,
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.800]   and again, they were treated greatly.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.840]   They were feasted royally.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.040]   They were treated kindly by Joseph.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.060]   They brought into his own household.
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.800]   They separated with him.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.040]   And now in this passage,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.100]   they are preparing to depart.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.940]   Let's read it.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:24.000]   But Joseph has one more test to bring to bear
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.080]   on his brothers.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.680]   Now Joseph gave these instructions
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.040]   to the steward of his house.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.400]   Fill the man's sacks with as much food as they can carry,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.540]   and put each man's silver in the mouth of his sack.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   Then, then put my cup, the silver one,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.920]   in the mouth of the youngest one's sack,
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.420]   along with the silver for his grain.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.560]   And he did as Joseph said.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.100]   As the morning dawned, the men were sent out on their way
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.100]   with their donkeys.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.980]   They had not gone far from the city
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.140]   when Joseph said to his steward,
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.060]   "Go after them men at once.
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.380]   "And when you catch up with them, say to them,
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.640]   "why have you repaid good with evil?
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.440]   "Isn't this the cup my master drinks from
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.260]   "and also uses for divination?
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.460]   "This is a wicked thing you have done."
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.980]   When he caught up with them,
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.840]   he repeated these words to him.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.380]   But they said to him, "Why does my Lord say these things?
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.720]   "Far be it from your servants to do anything like that.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.460]   "We even brought back to you from the land of Cain
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.640]   "and the silver we found inside the mouth of your sacks.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.240]   "So why would we steal silver or gold
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.620]   "from your master's house?
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.620]   "If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.000]   "And the rest of us will become the Lord's slave."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.260]   Now what we're gonna see is this.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.980]   We will see that for reconciliation to take place,
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.960]   it involved three steps.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.140]   And the first one is this.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.340]   It involved a conspiracy, a conspiracy.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.420]   Joseph and his brothers
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.940]   had just enjoyed a time of celebration.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.740]   The brothers still do not know who Joseph is.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.700]   But he's dropping hints there and then.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.820]   For example, when he seats the brothers
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.600]   in chapter 43 at the table,
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.620]   they are, we are told,
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.520]   astonishingly seated in birth order.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.300]   And we read that Benjamin, Joseph's only full brother,
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.540]   is given five times,
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.580]   five times as much as the rest of the brothers
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.060]   during the meal.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.100]   All you can eat.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.900]   Now the meal is over and the next day has dawned.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.420]   The brothers are feeling pretty good about things.
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.440]   They've convinced the prime minister of Egypt
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.140]   that they're not spies.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.340]   They have rescued their brother, Simeon, from prison.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.020]   They are about to return home
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.340]   with more grain for the family, all their money,
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.140]   and most importantly,
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.380]   they are returning home with Benjamin,
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.720]   just as Judah had promised his father.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.780]   So the morning dawns
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.540]   and the men take their grain and their animals
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.240]   and they set out towards home.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.180]   No doubt, they are filled with excitement
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.260]   at going home to their families and children.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.540]   No doubt, they are congratulating themselves
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.500]   on their successful mission to Egypt.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.980]   But what they don't know
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.380]   is that God is working behind the scenes
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.900]   to bring them face to face with a sin.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.560]   A sin some 22 years old.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.140]   While the men are preparing to leave,
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.700]   Joseph tells the steward of his house
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.860]   to prepare the grain they need.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.860]   His order is to give them as much as they can carry.
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.380]   In verse one, he tells the steward
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.180]   to give them their money back also.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:21.820]   Then Joseph tells his steward to do something very strange.
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.040]   We see in verse two, he tells the man
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.180]   to take his personal cup
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.640]   and place it in the sack that belongs to Benjamin.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.500]   This is done and the men set out towards home.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.220]   When they've been gone a while,
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.940]   Joseph sets the steward after them to stop them
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:50.000]   and to confront them about the cup in Benjamin's sack.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.340]   The steward follows them and accuses them
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.380]   of rewarding evil for good.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.740]   We read earlier, he accuses them
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.300]   of stealing Joseph's silver cup, that's verse six.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.020]   In verse seven, the brothers deny the charge
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.120]   and seek to defend their honour.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.100]   They remind the steward that they have plenty of money.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.700]   It isn't likely they would steal a cup.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.740]   And in verse eight, they are so sure of their innocence,
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.620]   they make such strong promises.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.900]   They swear in verse nine, that if the cup is found
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.740]   among them, the guilty brother will die
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.700]   and the rest will become slaves to the Egyptians.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.200]   Think about this for a moment.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.420]   This is a very strange way for Joseph
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.000]   to treat his brothers.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.060]   A very strange way for Joseph to treat his brothers.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.900]   In this passage, God uses Joseph as an instrument
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:05.100]   to draw these men to a place of repentance and restoration.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:11.780]   We saw, do you remember in week two, long time ago,
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.580]   22 years before, that these men had conspired,
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.580]   Genesis 37, against Joseph in an effort to get rid of him.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:26.700]   They had conspired to Joseph's harm.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:32.780]   Now the tables are turned and Joseph conspires against them.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:39.200]   But unlike his brothers, he is not conspiring
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.380]   in an effort to harm them.
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:46.440]   He is conspiring for their good.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   Now, we need to remember there are no accidents in life.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:58.280]   If you're a child of God, every event of your life,
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.720]   according to Romans 8, 28, is a product of divine providence
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.560]   that God is working out.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.680]   Isaiah 55 describes his will in your life
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.340]   in ways that you and I cannot begin to comprehend.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.960]   And this even includes the way that God deals with our sins.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.800]   There are times when we allow,
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.060]   we allow sin to abide in our lives.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.000]   After a while, we could get so used to sin's presence
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.700]   to the point where it no longer bothers us.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.180]   Or we may come away thinking, ah, we got away with it,
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.480]   with some sin or other.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.400]   Because we've not faced judgment
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.480]   or chastisement over that sin.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.840]   The fact is, God knows exactly when and how
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.880]   to speak to our hearts.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.360]   When the time is right,
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.440]   He will touch all the right buttons to humble us
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.740]   and bring us to a place of repentance.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.560]   God knows how to get our attention.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.800]   And He is not afraid to touch or take
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.920]   what He pleases to speak to our hearts.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.700]   He has a silver cup, a silver cup,
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.000]   that He can place in our lives to open our eyes
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.700]   when we have walked away from Him.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:31.020]   My friends, sooner or later,
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:36.480]   the silver cup will end up in your sack.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.640]   And I'll say it again.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:45.760]   Sooner or later, the silver cup will end up in your sack.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:53.420]   We've come to believe we can get away with sin.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.420]   Like Adam and Eve, we think we can cover it up
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.760]   with flimsy fig leaves of our own making.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.760]   God, however, will settle for nothing less
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.440]   than total confession and repentance.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.280]   And the best thing a believer can do
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.280]   is to get sin out into the open as soon as possible.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.720]   The best thing we can do with sin,
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.740]   according to 1 John 1:9,
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:29.120]   is to hate it, forsake it, and confess it to Him.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.800]   When we refuse, there will be a high price
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.720]   to pay for our disobedience.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.080]   We may not understand it all,
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.580]   but this is what is happening in these verses.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.960]   God is in the process of burning the barley fields
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.820]   of these brothers of Joseph.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.860]   God is in the process of getting their attention.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:57.600]   He is conspiring to bring them back to Him.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.300]   So yes, it involved a conspiracy.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:05.200]   But secondly, it also involved a confrontation.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.020]   Verse 10.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:13.160]   Very well then, he said, let it be as you say.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.680]   Whoever is found to have it will become my slave.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.080]   The rest of you will be free from blame.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.160]   Each of them quickly lowered his sack
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.960]   to the ground and opened it.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.640]   Then the steward proceeded to search,
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.900]   beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.400]   And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.320]   The cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.960]   At this, they tore their clothes,
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.480]   then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.440]   The sacks were opened and searched.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.520]   These brothers knew they'd done nothing wrong.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.000]   Can you see them standing there
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.160]   with smug expressions on their faces?
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.920]   As each sack is opened and the silver cup is not found,
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.620]   they grow more and more confident.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:16.060]   But when they open Benjamin's sack,
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:21.060]   to their disbelief, their glistening in Benjamin's sack
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.000]   is Joseph's silver cup.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.880]   This is the moment of truth.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.000]   This is Joseph's final test of his brothers.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.360]   All this time, Joseph has been testing them
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.800]   to see whether or not they've changed.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.660]   Now note, they've passed several tests already.
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.720]   They brought Benjamin back, as Joseph has requested.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.640]   They returned for their brother, Simeon.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.320]   They even returned all the grain money
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.300]   they had been given back.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.860]   This is the ultimate test.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   22 years earlier, they had hated Joseph so much
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.680]   that they attacked him, cast him in a pit,
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.280]   and sold him into slavery.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.880]   They had broken their father's heart
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.280]   by lying to him about what happened to Joseph.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.200]   They had maintained that lie for all these years.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.640]   And now, they have the opportunity
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.960]   to get rid of the other son of Rachel.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   It is clear from the text that Jacob loves Benjamin.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:40.000]   It seems clear that Benjamin had replaced Joseph
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.800]   as the father's favorite son.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.980]   But all they have to do is this,
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.980]   allow Benjamin to be arrested, take him back to Joseph.
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.480]   They can simply go home.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.360]   It would obviously break the heart of their father,
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.360]   but he'd enjoyed other heartbreaks in the past.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.640]   This is the ultimate test.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.080]   These men do not know it,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.800]   but they are about to reveal to Joseph
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.280]   what kind of men they have become.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:20.400]   And these men passed the test with flying colors.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.200]   They do not know how the cup got into Benjamin's sack.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.720]   At that point, that particular fact doesn't even matter,
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.000]   but they are determined to face whatever comes together.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.080]   They tear their clothes off as a sign of grief,
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.560]   and they go to face the music as one.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.840]   There are no accusations thrown at each other.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.320]   There are no compromises.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.460]   There is simply a unified resolve to stand by their brother.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.040]   What we see here is a picture of 10 men
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.960]   who are finally ready to do the right thing.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.320]   Here are 10 men who have finally grown up
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.280]   and are willing to face whatever consequences
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.220]   they are together.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.400]   These men have grown to the point
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.080]   when they can see beyond themselves.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.520]   They have a desire to do right
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.600]   regardless of the personal cost.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.440]   My friends, that is the place
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.720]   that God wants us to reach as well.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.640]   He wants us to come to the place
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.560]   where we stop making excuses for our behavior.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.400]   He wants us to come to the place
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.280]   where we are willing to own up to our sins.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.080]   God wants us to stop pointing the finger at others.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.720]   My sins are not my parents' fault.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.180]   I can't blame my evil on my wife or my surroundings.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.480]   If I'm gonna enjoy cleansing and forgiveness,
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.760]   I have to deal with my sins openly and honestly.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.320]   If I'm gonna have the power of God on my life,
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.020]   then I have to do the right thing.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.320]   God wants us to reach the place
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.280]   where we are willing to do the right thing
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.940]   regardless of personal cost.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.400]   Have you reached that place?
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.840]   Have I reached that place?
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.900]   We can with His help.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.160]   I don't know about you, but I wanna get there.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.080]   God is not afraid to confront us
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.960]   at the very point of our sins
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.220]   in order to open our eyes to a need for repentance.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.880]   These brothers are facing the things they are facing
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.480]   because God is determined to get their attention
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.080]   and bring them back into a right relationship with Him.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.380]   He will do the same in your life and mine.
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:03.900]   The best thing we can do with God is to keep short accounts.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.120]   Sin should be confessed immediately,
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.500]   completely, and honestly.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.800]   When it is, it can be forgiven.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.160]   And the blessings of God can freely flow into our lives.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.460]   And this introduces our third step.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.800]   Yes, it involves a conspiracy.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.920]   Secondly, it involves a confrontation.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.620]   But thirdly, it involves a confession.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.480]   When the brothers arrived back at Joseph's palace,
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.600]   they still find him there.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.340]   Verse 14, Joseph was still in the house
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.400]   when Judah and the brothers came in
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.500]   and they threw themselves to the ground before him.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:50.300]   And no doubt, Joseph was waiting to see who would show up.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.760]   Would it be Benjamin alone?
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.320]   Or would the rest of the brothers be with him?
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:01.160]   By the way, this little trick may have been Joseph's way
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.200]   of protecting Benjamin from his brothers.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.480]   When the brothers appear before Joseph,
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.360]   they bow themselves to the ground before him.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.080]   And just like last week, this fulfills the dreams
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.160]   that Joseph had as a young man.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.660]   Go to Genesis 37, five to 11.
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:27.760]   Joseph confronts his brothers about the silver cup.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.720]   At this point, Judah steps forward
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.980]   and delivers one of the most profound
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.960]   and eloquent speeches in the whole Bible.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.120]   A careful examination of this speech
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.640]   will show just how far Judah has matured.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.920]   In verse 16, Judah confesses their sin.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.340]   What can we say to my Lord?
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.040]   What can we say?
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.060]   How can we prove our innocence?
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.080]   God has uncovered your servant's guilt.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.240]   We are now, my Lord, slaves.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.880]   We ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.520]   He doesn't name names.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.080]   But he does confess the fact that they had sin
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.040]   and God was punishing them for their sin.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.680]   He seemed to believe that what they are about to face,
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.760]   slavery in Egypt, is a direct result
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.300]   of their unconfessed sin.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:24.440]   He offers himself along with all the rest of the brothers
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.360]   as Joseph's servants.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:32.440]   In verse 17, we see that Joseph refuses Judah's offer
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.000]   and tells him and the rest of the brothers to go home.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.240]   He tells him that Benjamin,
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.480]   Benjamin will have to stay as a slave.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.120]   The verses 18 to 34, we don't have time to go through them,
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.640]   are the heart of Judah's speech.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.280]   He reminds Joseph that the only reason Benjamin had come
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.400]   was because Joseph had demanded it.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.880]   Judah then tells Joseph that Jacob will die
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   if anything happens to his youngest son.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.720]   Next, and this is important,
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.820]   Judah offers himself in Benjamin's place.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.200]   He offers to stay in Egypt as Joseph's slave
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.480]   so that Benjamin can return to Canaan
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.520]   with the other brothers.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.880]   This is the moment,
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.800]   this is the moment that Joseph has been waiting for.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.560]   He's been waiting and working
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.080]   since his brothers showed up in Egypt.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.240]   He sees that they have changed.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.160]   He sees that the brothers are willing
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.560]   to stand together as one man.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.120]   They had the chance to turn their backs on Benjamin,
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.720]   but they didn't.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.120]   Judah stands up and puts his father, Benjamin,
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.980]   and the rest of the brothers ahead of himself.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.680]   It's interesting, isn't it?
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:53.560]   That the guilty offers himself
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.680]   as a substitute for the innocent.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.520]   But there will be another lion of the tribe of Judah
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.280]   who is innocent,
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:13.680]   who would offer himself as a substitute for the guilty.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:20.200]   And his name is Jesus.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:26.480]   This is a major turning point in the story.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.320]   When Joseph hears Judah's confession
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.320]   and sees his love for the family in action,
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.860]   it's more than he can stand.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.920]   Joseph breaks down before his brothers
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   and reveals his identity to them.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.360]   We read,
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:50.320]   Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:57.200]   Today, there is a lesson that we need to take to heart.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.480]   Judah shows us how sin is to be handled.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.920]   His actions also remind us of the very nature of sin.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.640]   Let's consider those two thoughts before we close today.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:16.520]   Firstly, sin by its very nature is a very selfish thing.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.240]   When sin entered the world,
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.280]   it entered because Eve was selfish.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.900]   She chose herself over the Lord, Genesis 3.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.440]   When sin entered the universe,
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.200]   it entered through selfishness.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   Every sin that we commit is rooted in selfishness.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.880]   Secondly, our sins are all about us.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.080]   When we choose ourselves over every other person
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.400]   and over every other thing, we are saying,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   I want what I want and I do not care about the consequences.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.040]   I repeat, sin is a very selfish act.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:02.920]   When we sin, we are choosing ourselves over God,
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.160]   over His will, over the church, over our families,
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.640]   over everything but our own selfish wants,
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.280]   desires and wishes.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.100]   Sin is rooted in selfishness.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.640]   But when our hearts are as they should be,
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.600]   the Lord, His will and the needs of others
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.040]   will come before our own desires.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.400]   You know you're making progress in the Lord
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.900]   when you refuse to sin
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.080]   because of how it will affect the Lord's work
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.920]   and how it will affect others.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:41.000]   I'll be honest with you, most people turn away from sin
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.960]   because they're afraid of being caught.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.200]   But a mature believer looks at sin
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.960]   and sees the damage it can do to the church,
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.040]   the community, the Lord's work, the family and others.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:59.020]   The only way to get past sin is to deal with it honestly.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.300]   Like Judah, we have to come to the place
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.760]   where we confess our sins and get them out before the Lord
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.040]   and before those we have sinned against.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.360]   Sin must not be hidden.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.320]   It must be confessed openly and early.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.360]   When it is, the Lord can extend forgiveness
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.720]   and restoration.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.480]   The sin can be put behind you
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.440]   and you can move on in the Lord.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.560]   All my friends, if Joseph in this scheme
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.160]   knew how to search out the hearts of his brothers,
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.900]   how much more does God know how to search our hearts?
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.120]   In 3 John verse four, John says this,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.760]   "I have no greater joy than to hear
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.160]   that my children walk in truth."
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.200]   John was saying that his greatest joy as a preacher
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.840]   and an apostle was to see the people he ministered to
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.360]   growing and walking in the truth he had taught them.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.720]   I know how he feels.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.520]   That's the same feeling that must have gripped
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.280]   the heart of Joseph as he looked at Judah,
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.820]   saw his broken heart and heard his heartfelt words.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:15.860]   The brothers of Joseph had finally grown up.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.740]   And they were ready to make things right.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.920]   And the importance of this, my friends, is this.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.860]   There can be no reconciliation without repentance.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.100]   Can I say that again?
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:36.980]   There can be no reconciliation without repentance.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:43.100]   As I bring these thoughts to a close today,
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.740]   let me ask you a couple of questions.
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.140]   First one of this, are you growing in the Lord?
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.940]   How would you know?
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:58.620]   You can know that you are growing in your relationship
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.660]   with the Lord when you begin to hate sin.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.820]   You know you are growing when you are willing
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.900]   to tell the truth about your sins.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.220]   You know you are growing when you reach the place
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.320]   where you are more concerned about others
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.780]   than you are about yourself.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:17.380]   Second question, are there sins in your life
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.920]   that need to be confessed?
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.500]   Maybe you need to get before the Lord today
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.500]   and deal with some sin in your life.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.260]   Maybe you need to go to someone you've hurt
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.940]   and confess that hurt to them.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:34.100]   Things will never be as they could until you do.
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:40.060]   And lastly, are you afraid
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.980]   there might be a silver cup in your future?
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.420]   If you know there are areas of your life
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.340]   that are not where you need to be with the Lord
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.260]   and you fear that he might resort to drastic measures
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.420]   to get your attention, you need to come to him
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.240]   and deal with the matter now.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.800]   Do you know that if sin is on your mind today,
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.560]   it's the Holy Spirit calling you to come to God
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.580]   to deal with the matter.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.060]   In my opinion, it is far better to come before the Lord
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.060]   in humble repentance than it is to wait for him
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.800]   to burn your barley fields.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:27.240]   If the Lord has spoken to your heart on any level,
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.060]   you need to come to him today
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:35.120]   and do what he is telling you to do.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:42.080]   You do what he would have you to do.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.840]   As I ask the band to come back,
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.040]   we're now gonna have an act of reconciliation.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.440]   So could the band come back?
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:58.160]   If there's anyone here today who has no sin,
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.860]   you better come to the front and pray for the rest of us.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.440]   I believe this is a hard word for us,
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.360]   but there's an answer.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.960]   We need to come before God.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:21.920]   I'm gonna ask you if you're able to kneel.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.040]   If you're not able to kneel, just to sit,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.180]   but I want you to take this seriously.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.760]   We're gonna have an act of reconciliation together
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.680]   before God.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.100]   (soft music)
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:42.840]   If I can get down at 72, you can all get down.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:48.920]   The Holy Spirit is gonna do something here now.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:54.280]   And to help me, I'm gonna use some words
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.080]   from the book of common prayer.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.560]   These are the words I was just referring to earlier
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.640]   from 1 John 1, 8 and 9.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.640]   "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.780]   "and the truth is not in us.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:22.700]   "But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:29.380]   "to forgive us our sins and cleanse us
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.280]   "from all unrighteousness."
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.400]   Holy Spirit come.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.560]   Holy Spirit come.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.000]   Holy Spirit come.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.420]   (soft music)
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.280]   Almighty God, our heavenly Father,
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.060]   we have sinned against you and against our fellow men
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.060]   in thought and word and deed.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.120]   Through negligence, through weakness,
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.800]   through our own deliberate fault.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:04.280]   We are truly sorry and repent of all our sins
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.720]   for the sake of your Son, Jesus Christ, who died for us.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.200]   Forgive us all that is past.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.940]   I grant that we may serve you in newness of life.
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.040]   To the glory of your name.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.140]   Amen.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.780]   Just allow the Holy Spirit just to work.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.840]   Just as the Lord brings things to your mind,
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.040]   offer them to Him.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.980]   Allow Him to work.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.600]   (soft music)
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.780]   I believe this is such a significant time for us
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.980]   as a church today.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.820]   As we lay down these things before Him.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:35:00.860]   You know, this was a sin that happened 22 years beforehand.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.060]   And there may be some things
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.940]   that have just been lingering around in your life.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.340]   Just bring them before God.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:17.240]   Holy Spirit, just come as we offer these to you.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:24.780]   Give us assurance of our forgiveness.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.520]   Fill us up, Lord.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.720]   I also feel that while we're on our knees,
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.460]   we need to pray for our world today.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:15.100]   This thing of blame, this thing of conflict,
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:20.000]   so prevalent in our society all across the world.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.880]   Lord, we pray for country leaders, for church leaders.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.300]   (soft music)
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:39.960]   Pray for the need to get before you,
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.060]   to get before each other and say, "Sorry."
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:53.480]   For this church, Lord divine in you alone,
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   I just pray that you will restore relationships.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:04.120]   Lord, that we would see people with different eyes.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.520]   We see them as you see them.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:12.840]   Help us to be people who are more ready to forgive
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.000]   than we are to blame.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:23.400]   Come Holy Spirit and do a new work in our lives.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.800]   Change us from the inside out.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:46.360]   As the band leads us in our final song,
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.520]   if you're happy to stay on your knees, just stay here.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.320]   Let's worship God together.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.000]   He's called us to be family.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.460]   He's called us to be one.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:02.040]   He's called us to be united.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:08.240]   Take away the love of sinning.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:18.000]   Just bring to your body here, your righteousness,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.160]   your peace and your unity.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   Let's worship God together.
