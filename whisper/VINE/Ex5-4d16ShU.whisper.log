[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   So, I'm sure you would agree with me that there have been some pretty incredible inventions
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.880]   over the years, the centuries, right, that really have transformed and revolutionized
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.800]   how we do things, even the simple things, you know, like a light bulb.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.680]   Could you imagine if we didn't have a light bulb?
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.680]   Electricity.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.440]   Even an umbrella.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.680]   Who was thankful for the invention of an umbrella today?
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.440]   The World Wide Web Internet as we know it.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.680]   I mean, sometimes we may not be thankful, but I think the majority of us would say technology
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.720]   has advanced at incredible paces, and if you're watching online, you get to benefit with that
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.520]   as well today.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:57.600]   Well, one of my favorite inventions has to be the Kindle.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.920]   I love the Kindle.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.000]   Now I know all of you book lovers out there, you know, the ones that like to touch and
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.120]   feel and smell the pages.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.160]   Yes, yes, I know, we're getting nods here.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.360]   Heather Rose, I know you're watching online.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.560]   I know you love your books as well.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.840]   Well, I love the books, the Kindles, especially living in Hong Kong, because you know what
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.920]   it's like if we have too many books?
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.480]   Where do we put them?
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.080]   So with a Kindle, you can have hundreds of books, and you do not have to worry about
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.320]   storage, right?
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:43.320]   I love my Kindle because I love reading, and I love stories, and stories can be powerful
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.000]   tools that really do shape how we think and how we view the world.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.200]   Think of your favorite movie or book.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.000]   When you're immersed in that book or that movie, and you are so engrossed with what's
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.120]   happening, you have no idea what's happening outside of that book or that movie, and your
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.840]   brain is telling you that you are part of that story.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   Well, there is a term for this.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.520]   It's called narrative transportation theory.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.240]   Did you know that?
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.240]   It's true.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.120]   It's amazing what you learn here in church.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.920]   Narrative transportation theory, seriously.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:35.400]   This suggests that the power of stories can actually change attitudes and intentions that
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.000]   are reflected in the story.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.360]   I am 100% convinced this is true.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:53.960]   When I watch Tomb Raider, I am Lara Croft, and I am abseiling down the IFC.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.120]   Now if you've never watched Tomb Raider, you have no idea what I'm talking about, but the
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.420]   point is in our 21st century, with social media, we know that stories impact us.
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.760]   It can be negative, and it can be positive.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.600]   I love that Jesus was way ahead of all the philosophers and the psychologists of the
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:27.000]   past and the influencers of the present in understanding how stories draw listeners in.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.320]   They influence thoughts, feelings, and behavior.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:41.680]   As we come to the end of our series on parables, we have seen how Jesus used stories to disrupt,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.260]   to challenge, and inspire.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.580]   Jesus was not just a great storyteller.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:58.160]   Jesus intentionally provoked the imagination of his audience to dismantle their views of
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:07.420]   the world, in particular its value system, so that the true nature of God's world would
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.620]   be revealed, and that would inspire change.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.740]   Jesus knew that the people that gathered around him, those that loved him, those that hated
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:26.500]   him, and those that weren't quite sure what they thought about him, were far more likely
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.620]   to be challenged to look at the world differently when they heard parables, stories that they
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.800]   could help see the world, force them to think, make choices.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:49.820]   Do they embrace this new upside-down value system, or do they ignore it and just continue
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.980]   with life as they have always done and face the consequences?
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.380]   And this week, we are looking at the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, found in the
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.380]   Gospel of Luke.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:11.440]   So as we open up God's word, as we listen to Jesus' words, let's also be willing to
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:20.520]   dismantle our own worldviews, challenge some of our behaviors, so that we are inspired
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.400]   to live a kingdom lifestyle.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.960]   And as I read through Luke now, I want to invoke your imagination.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.260]   We're going to do that through words and art.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.680]   And so as I read, you will see various artistic interpretations of this parable presented
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.580]   over the centuries.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:53.040]   So sit back, look, and listen.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.000]   There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.560]   At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores, longing to eat what fell
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.860]   from the rich man's table.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.920]   Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.500]   The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.360]   The rich man also died and was buried in Hades, where he was in torment.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.560]   He looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.160]   So he called to him, "Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.460]   of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire."
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.360]   But Abraham replied, "Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.800]   while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.360]   And besides all this, between us and you, a great chasm has been set in place, so that
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.440]   those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us."
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.920]   He answered, "Then I beg you, Father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.940]   Let him warn them so that they will not also come to this place of torment."
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.400]   Abraham replied, "They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them."
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.880]   "No, Father Abraham," he said, "but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent."
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.600]   He said to them, "If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced,
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:43.180]   even if someone rises from the dead."
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:50.220]   So what was Jesus trying to convey to the audience of his day?
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:56.100]   From the previous verses, we can assume that Jesus is addressing the parable to his disciples
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:02.400]   and to the Pharisees, who had earlier been sneering at Jesus when Jesus was teaching
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.660]   the disciples that you cannot love God and money.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:14.580]   And as Jesus begins this parable, we know, or we can just imagine, how annoyed the Pharisees
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:19.060]   were beginning to be with Jesus.
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:25.340]   There are two main characters that Jesus introduces at the start, the rich man and Lazarus.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:30.640]   And we have vivid descriptions that leave the listeners in no doubt that we have someone
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:37.140]   very wealthy who's living a life of luxury and indulgence in contrast to a man named
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:42.740]   Lazarus, who is living in inhumane misery.
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.180]   Even the dogs are mistreating him.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:53.980]   He's destitute, isolated, alone, hungry, physically and emotionally suffering.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:09:01.720]   Now interestingly, this is the only parable where Jesus actually names one of his characters.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.960]   And scholars debate various different reasons why Jesus does this.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:14.720]   But what it does show is how significant this suffering man was to God.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.980]   Calling someone by their name is very personal.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.240]   It invokes a connection to that person.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:29.120]   And here, our pearl man is named Lazarus, which actually means God helps, and which
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:35.080]   we see as being prophetic as the story unfolds.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.600]   This is an important reminder to us today.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:50.120]   And it should be a comfort in a world where it is easy to feel nameless and unknown, forgotten,
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.960]   unseen.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:10:00.320]   God does know us, he does see us, and he calls us by name.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.120]   Some of you are here today, and maybe immediately you identify with Lazarus.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.600]   You too are suffering in your own ways.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.440]   You don't feel seen.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.560]   You don't feel heard.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.560]   You don't feel known.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:23.200]   You have huge needs that are crushing you at times, needs that you share and needs that
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.240]   you hold, and only you know the weight of them.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   Well, my prayer for you today is as we unfold this story together, that while you're here,
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.920]   you would experience the Holy Spirit ministering very personally to you.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:49.520]   Because as I stand here and I look out at lots of different faces, God looks out and
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:55.640]   he sees every one of you and knows you by name.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:03.160]   May God minister to you personally, and may you leave here being known, being seen, being
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.960]   loved, and with hope.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:16.920]   Jesus makes this contrast with a nameless rich man who doesn't invoke any sympathy.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.600]   And even though Lazarus is on the doorstep of the rich man, he's lying right in front
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.440]   of him, there is no excuse for not knowing that this Lazarus is there.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:37.000]   But the rich man is portrayed as doing nothing, simply living his life his way every day.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.160]   And then as the story unfolds, we see a dramatic switch in their circumstances, which happens
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.600]   when they both die.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.840]   Death comes to us all.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.840]   This would have been a reminder to everyone, it's a reminder for us today, regardless whether
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:02.280]   you're rich, you're poor, whether you obey the law, you don't obey the law, whether you're
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:10.320]   a good person or whether you're a bad person, nobody can escape death.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.240]   There is no escaping death, and there's no escaping judgment after death.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.880]   But there is also hope, and that's what we see in Lazarus.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:30.120]   Hope also for us as believers in Jesus that despite the challenges that we face now, despite
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:40.280]   the pain or the suffering that we endure, we will know hope, we will know comfort.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.440]   Now Jesus is drawing on the ancient Jewish teachings of that day, which for sure the
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.820]   Pharisees would have been very familiar with.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:57.000]   He introduces his listeners into the afterlife, the concept of paradise and hell, which in
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.840]   the Greek is referred to by Luke as Hades.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:07.280]   It's strong imagery, would have been very familiar, very familiar to the Jewish people
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:15.240]   of Jesus' day, which paints that picture of this great patriarchal figure of Abraham comforting
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:22.760]   and blessing Lazarus while the rich man is suffering and in great torment.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.760]   And again, the power in Jesus' storytelling is that it was relatable to his audience,
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:36.800]   its familiar language, its culture, and its beliefs that were prevalent at their time.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:43.960]   The Pharisees believed in a bodily resurrection with life after death, where good deeds were
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.240]   rewarded and bad deeds punished.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:54.200]   So they would have had no problem accepting that Abraham was in paradise, welcoming the
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.660]   righteous.
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:01.760]   No doubt the Pharisees though, living with an assumed presumption that they were all
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.080]   going to go to paradise one day.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:13.800]   But as Jesus depicts in this particular parable, the one rewarded here and the one punished
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:21.600]   portrays a very different value system, which would have challenged his listeners.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.160]   You see, what is interesting is that the rich man is not portrayed as having committed a
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.000]   particular sin.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.620]   Doesn't look like he actually did anything wrong.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.640]   Having money, being blessed with material wealth is not a sin.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.360]   Jesus never said it was.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.040]   Rather it is how we live with what we have.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:56.760]   And in this case, it is the rich man's inaction and selfish living for himself that Jesus
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.120]   is calling out.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.640]   Jesus is not condemning him for being rich.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.760]   This is not a parable against those that have plenty.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:13.960]   But Jesus' story was showing in the kingdom of God of which Jesus was there to proclaim,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:21.520]   the poor and the suffering would be comforted and be rewarded as righteous and those that
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.460]   lived for themselves would be held to account.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:34.080]   Not only is Jesus highlighting the lack of action by the rich man, he also portrays the
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.720]   rich man's arrogance.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.320]   This is arrogant attitude.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.160]   It continues right after his death.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:50.440]   His language may be respectful to Father Abraham, but he has this expectation that Lazarus should
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.920]   come and serve him.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.860]   It's almost demonstrating this sense of entitlement.
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:04.040]   There is this assumption by the rich man that Lazarus should leave his place of blessing
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:11.520]   by Abraham's side and go over and join him to alleviate his suffering.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.720]   And Abraham's response to this is basically, "No."
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:22.020]   He points out a very different set of values, very different set of values and a sense of
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.800]   justice.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:30.260]   After all, the rich man had already received all his good things on earth as Abraham had
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.100]   told him.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:38.580]   And only then do we see a glimpse of the rich man thinking of others as he pleads on behalf
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.100]   of his brothers.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:46.720]   But again, the response from Abraham implies that the rich man neglected scripture, its
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:54.680]   teachings, and even a miracle of somebody rising from the dead would make no difference.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.760]   I cannot help but imagine how the readers of the Gospel of Luke would have made that
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:06.880]   connection right at the early church between Jesus' own resurrection and how true his words
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:17.360]   would be in their context when even after Jesus rose again, so many refused to believe.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.560]   The kingdom of God was at the heart of Jesus' teaching.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:27.880]   Not only did his parables focus on helping people to understand how the kingdom functioned,
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:34.840]   but he also challenged people to change their behaviors when seeking his kingdom.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:41.240]   The Pharisees, many, many of the religious leaders of Jesus' day, they focused heavily
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.060]   on the law, or they appeared to do so.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:52.540]   But they neglected the spirit behind God's law, the heart of God.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:58.160]   They ignored the real needs of the people around them, and Jesus would not tolerate
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160]   that.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.880]   Jesus was so confrontational to the religious leaders at his time.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.680]   You just need to read Matthew 23.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.840]   I love Matthew 23.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:19.360]   Jesus absolutely slams the religious leaders of his time.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:27.640]   They represented the antithesis of who God is, his heart for the poor and the vulnerable.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:36.480]   The Pharisees themselves played needless burdens on the people, and Jesus called them proud,
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:44.760]   boastful, show-offs, blind fools, pretenders, a brood of snipers.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.320]   The list just goes on.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:53.640]   In the kingdom of God, the poor, the suffering, the downcast, the oppressed are not unknown
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.920]   by God.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.360]   They will be blessed.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:04.240]   Never think that God is not aware or concerned with those living in poverty, those that are
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.480]   vulnerable, those that are suffering or oppressed.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.520]   Scripture's very clear how much God is on the side of the vulnerable and speaks again
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:20.120]   and again for the justice for the marginalized and comfort to those who are in pain.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.720]   And that is a comfort to us.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.960]   The disciples were also present listening to this story, and I wonder what went through
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   their minds.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.760]   Did they relate to Lazarus and his suffering?
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.480]   Some of them would have had to have left their own material comforts as they followed Jesus,
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.880]   suffered their own hardship and persecution along the way.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:51.520]   But they would have witnessed time and time again of Jesus modeling to them what it means
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:57.880]   to reach out and care for the poor, for the suffering.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:07.160]   Jesus didn't ignore it, and his disciples could not either, and neither should we.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:14.720]   Jesus spoke parables to teach about God's world that was in the present and in the future.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:22.000]   And he lived out this new world by healing the sick, setting the oppressed free, caring
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.800]   for the poor, speaking up for the marginalized.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:33.400]   And the disciples were in the midst of seeing the kingdom of God at work in real time with
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:40.800]   Jesus, and they were challenged also to make their own choices in how they responded in
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:46.000]   their own actions and attitudes.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.280]   Those hearing this parable would have understood it to mean inaction and indifference to the
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.640]   poor and suffering were not acceptable in the kingdom of God.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.840]   Never has been, and never will be.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.580]   So what does this actually mean for us?
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:10.280]   How does this parable reshape our worldviews?
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.160]   How does it challenge us?
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:20.120]   How does it inspire us to live proactively with kingdom values, and maybe sometimes those
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   values that are countercultural?
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:32.880]   I think for many of us, we do respond practically to help the poor and the marginalized.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   We use our resources in various ways, whether it's our time, our finances, our skill set.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.320]   And I know many of you here are very generous.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.800]   I just heard recently that there are a group of you that every Monday you're cooking on
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.720]   the first floor in our kitchen, preparing food, and then you're going out and you're
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   feeding the homeless.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.920]   And you've been doing that for years.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:07.920]   I know that many of you work for NGOs or are in professions that care for others, that
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:15.600]   require you to advocate daily for those that maybe are of a lesser social status.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:22.400]   There are many of you here that are providing extra support to the poor and the marginalized.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:28.820]   And some of you are in positions of power, of influence, and you are choosing to make
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:34.400]   a difference, to use your resources to help others.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:40.520]   You will hear us preach and teach from the front about the importance of social justice,
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:46.320]   about how it's important to treat each other respectfully and fairly.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   We will even call each other out when we've witnessed or seen some behaviors that don't
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:59.600]   treat people fairly, and we've spoken about those from the front as well.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.440]   And that's all good.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.760]   And let's keep doing good.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:10.560]   And let's keep using our resources and making a difference and being a light in this city.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:19.620]   But what I want to ask us is a question around how easily it is for our attitudes to subtly
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:27.200]   change which actually will affect our response and our relationship to those in need and
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.080]   our relationship to God.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:36.000]   And we need to be on guard of those so we don't find ourselves suddenly acting like
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.680]   the rich man.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:45.360]   I think the first attitude that we need to watch out for is this indifference.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.520]   Indifference can come subtly towards us.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:55.480]   We see it in this parable, even though the needs of Lazarus are very clearly in front
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.840]   of the rich man every single day, the rich man ignores him.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:07.140]   And I think it can creep into our own lives without realizing it as our hearts can suddenly
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.060]   become a little bit hard.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.120]   The reality is the world has a lot of needs.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.880]   It can feel overwhelming at times.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:25.280]   Many years ago, my husband and I, we set up a charity that was involved in working with
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.120]   a country that was facing huge economic collapse.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.600]   We were specifically working with abandoned children.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.600]   We were newly married.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:42.720]   And honestly, there was a lot of sacrifice that went into setting this up, traveling,
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.880]   and not just the time but the money as well.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:55.480]   And after a while, the demands, the constant demands that we, that I felt, started to get
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.520]   to me.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:03.640]   And it wasn't until after a few years that I realized that actually I had become a little
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:11.640]   bit indifferent to those immediate needs around me, and that a sense of hardened heart had
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.520]   crept in.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:22.560]   And I knew that because I found that I had this subconscious attitude of, "I've done
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.440]   enough.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.720]   I've done a lot.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.840]   I'm tired.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.280]   I've done enough."
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:37.400]   Of course, I wouldn't say it, but I realized that that was something that was very real
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   in my life.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.000]   And it was only when I actually went to God and said, "You know what, God?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.240]   I need you to break my heart for what breaks yours."
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:58.720]   And as Christians, I think that's something that we have got to regularly be asking ourself
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.480]   and praying.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.680]   It's not enough to do it just because it's the right thing to do.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:14.600]   But if we could regularly ask God, "God, break my heart for what breaks yours," then that
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:23.520]   would keep our hearts soft and that attitude of indifference away.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.000]   The second attitude to be mindful of is entitlement.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.360]   Oh, yes, it's a subtle one as well.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:38.440]   And I'm sure at various times in our lives, we have had that sense of entitlement where
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.260]   you think you deserve special treatment.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.840]   Maybe it's, "I've studied really, really hard and I've gone to a great university and therefore
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.360]   I deserve to have that better job with more benefits."
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:58.000]   Or maybe it's a case of, "Well, actually, I come from a first world country and therefore
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.680]   I'm a lot more knowledge educated than maybe somebody else."
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:17.760]   Maybe it's, "I don't have enough and you have a lot and so therefore you should help me."
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:24.920]   You see, entitlement has many different levels, but it does creep in.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:30.360]   The rich man's sense of entitlement, that was clear, seen in his expectation even after
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.880]   death when he thought Lazarus should go over and serve him.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:42.040]   There was no awareness that he had done anything wrong, but rather excuse after excuse.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:49.800]   But in contrast, we see Lazarus who actually doesn't say a word throughout the whole parable.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.900]   He doesn't complain about his life.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:58.160]   He doesn't complain or express any resentment with the rich man.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:04.920]   There's no gloating or suffering now that the rich man is in a different position.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.880]   I'm not sure I would be so gracious.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.920]   So we need to check our hearts.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:18.560]   We need to check our hearts for that entitlement and we need to have that humility where we
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:27.760]   recognize that actually all that we have is given by God and that everything belongs to
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.760]   God.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:34.600]   And that humility keeps us in an attitude where we are constantly again reflecting and
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:42.720]   choosing to follow God's ways, have his heart so that that's the attitude that we're responding
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.280]   to others with.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:54.120]   But imagine in the city of Hong Kong or the place where you're residing now, if we as
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:29:00.640]   followers of Jesus decided to adopt the kingdom principles, which saw us acting in generous
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:07.880]   ways, kindness and compassion to everyone around us.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.200]   Recently the Hong Kong tourism board launched a new campaign to encourage people to be more
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:19.560]   hospitable to each other, especially the tourists, right?
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:24.160]   I don't know why, but apparently we as Hong Kongers can be rather unfriendly and rude.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.920]   I don't think that's true.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:31.240]   But anyway, I actually think it came from this kindness movement that Singapore launched
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.840]   a number of years ago.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:38.280]   They also said that they would like their people to be encouraged to be kinder to each
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.120]   other, especially to the tourists.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.880]   We live in such a transactional world.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.240]   Let's be kind because then more people will like us, then they will spend more money and
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.120]   that will help our economy grow.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.880]   The world that Jesus spoke about was the opposite.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.640]   This is not how the kingdom of God operates.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:09.120]   This is not how we should approach our relationship to the poor or those in need.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:17.840]   Rather when we realize we do not deserve anything and yet God gave everything, that should want
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:27.720]   us to respond in generosity towards each other for no expected return.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:38.440]   Whether we have plenty, whether we have less, we are all able to lead this city and show
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:43.280]   as we represent God's way.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.400]   And how can we practically respond to this message?
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.640]   What does it actually look like when we leave this place?
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:57.920]   Well back in Easter, my family and I, we went to Taiwan.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.640]   We had a couple of days in Taiwan.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.840]   And we were in this particular place one day where we had been dropped off and we were
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:10.320]   looking around a village and we had to then get back to the car that was picking us up
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.320]   at a certain time.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:17.840]   It was a really, really hot day and part of getting back to the car involved walking up
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.960]   a very, very, very, very steep hill.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.400]   It probably is about a 10 minute walk up.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.440]   And as I say it was very, very hot and it was also busy.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.840]   There was a lot of people around.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.040]   And I'm there with my son.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.680]   My son is 16.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:38.000]   And we're walking up on a time, we've got to get to the car.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.320]   And I'm saying to myself, "Oh, I'm so hot, so hot.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.600]   Come on, we've got to get there, got to get there."
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.000]   And in front of us, there is this grandma.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.240]   She must have been like late 70s, early 80s.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.680]   And she's pushing a push chair with a four-year-old in it.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.960]   And she's like pushing it up the hill like this.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:08.760]   And it's hot and I'm looking at her thinking, "Oh, no, this must be really hard for her.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.280]   She's got to push that child all the way up the hill."
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.680]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.680]   My son, my son is tall and strong.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   He walks in front.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:28.600]   As he's walking, he looks and with his hand, he grabs the front of the push chair and he
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.600]   starts to pull the push chair up the hill.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:37.760]   And the grandma is like, "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you so much."
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.360]   And the toddler is so excited.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:45.640]   And you know, I watched my son and I thought, "Wow."
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:56.160]   I was in the same situation and my response was, "Oh, that's going to be tough for her."
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.200]   My son's response was action.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:07.160]   And afterwards when I said to him, "How did you even think about doing that?"
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.800]   I was like, "I'm so proud of you."
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.360]   And he was like, "Hmm."
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:24.280]   And that is how we make a difference in Hong Kong, where we choose to see the people around
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:33.240]   us and where we choose to act differently, where we choose to allow what God has done
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:44.600]   for us to propel us in many different small and large ways where we can make a difference.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.180]   We all are known and loved by God.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.440]   The sacrifice on the cross is evidence.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:56.600]   It is evidence that God loves us all.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:05.720]   The desire for him to be in relationship with us should propel us to love others as he asked
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.560]   us to do.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:15.240]   So I leave you today with a very simple question and challenge.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.300]   Who is on your doorstep?
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:24.680]   And what are you going to do for them?
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:30.640]   Would you stand with me as I pray for us?
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:38.280]   And as we enter into a time of response, the song "Chosen" I believe is a prophetic word
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:48.960]   for us to sing because it talks about having God fill our hearts so that we will lead out
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.320]   of God's love and that we would see those around us and respond out of love to those
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.500]   around us.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:04.680]   May this message not just be, "Well, that was a nice message," or not, whatever.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:14.100]   May this message with the power of the Holy Spirit transform us as a church.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:22.780]   May we the vine be known for our good deeds, our kindness, our generosity, not because
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:29.900]   it's a good thing to do, but because of the power of the Holy Spirit working through us,
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.100]   that transforms a city.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:45.320]   So Father, as we stand here now, as we ask for your Spirit to empower us to live a life
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:52.860]   where we can bring change, where we can be countercultural at times, where we embrace
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:36:01.660]   the value system of the kingdom of God, I pray for the Lazaruses in this room right
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:06.900]   now who don't feel known, but they are known.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.660]   And I speak that over you, are known.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.620]   God knows your situation.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.200]   He knows exactly what you need.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:20.460]   And I pray that you would be filled with the comfort and the presence of the peace of God
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:26.960]   as you leave this place knowing that you are seen by God.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.460]   I pray for our young people.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:34.620]   I thank you that they are a witness to us.
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:42.820]   And I pray that you empower our young people to see the needs around them and to simply
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:51.160]   show and lead the way of what it means to love and care and be kind to others.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.420]   May we learn from them.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:37:02.060]   For us, Father, as we leave, as we look at who you have placed on the doorstep in front
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:09.740]   of us, may we not walk by, but may we take action.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:15.060]   And may you break our heart for what breaks yours.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.820]   We pray all of this in your name, Jesus.
