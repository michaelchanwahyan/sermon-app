1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 Amen everyone. And it's been, wow, quite a time. Quite a time today, quite a time

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,240
 in our city this week. And I'm feeling a bit emotional right now, so I hope that's

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,660
 okay. Feeling a bit pumped up for what the Holy Spirit, I think, is trying to say

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,800
 to us today off the back of this week. And for the excitement that I have

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,360
 for the Word today. We're continuing our series on dreaming again. And I want to

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,280
 literally just jump straight into Scripture, because I'm carrying a burden

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,800
 today about justice. Particularly about the realities of injustice in our world,

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,560
 and God's burden that He has for dreaming for His justice. And I'm just

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:48,040
 sensing in my spirit today a kind of uprising of His desire for justice, for

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,360
 the dreams of God's heart, for the gospel in our city like never before. So I want

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,800
 to jump into this passage. We're gonna open up the Word of God to

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,120
 Matthew chapter 27. I'm gonna start reading in a moment from verse 11. And I

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,040
 pray that as we unpack this passage today, this will be a word and season for

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,720
 you, and what God is doing in your life in this area of dreaming again. So let me

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,240
 read this to us. "Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,520
 asked him this, 'Are you the King of the Jews?' 'Yes, it is as you say,' Jesus replied.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,240
 When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. Then

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,440
 Pilate asked him, 'Don't you hear the testimony that they're bringing against

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,720
 you?' But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge, to the great amazement

20
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,920
 of the governor. Now it was the governor's custom at the feast to release a

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,560
 prisoner chosen by the crowd. At that time they had a notorious prisoner

22
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,160
 called Barabbas. So when the crowd gathered, Pilate asked them, 'Which one do

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,600
 you want me to release to you, Barabbas or Jesus, who is called the Christ, the

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,720
 Messiah?' For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him."

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,760
 Famous passage of Scripture, a famous story, an important pivotal moment in

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,240
 Jesus's life. This is of course the story of Jesus's trial, the moment where he's

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,240
 just like hours away from being sent towards his execution. This is the story

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,920
 that Matthew provides for us to understand what he's about to write in

29
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,320
 the rest of chapter 27. In just a few paragraphs ahead, he's gonna tell us the

30
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,440
 story of the death of Jesus, the suffering that comes upon Jesus as he's

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,400
 on the cross. And then in chapter 28, the wonder and the beauty that is found in

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,200
 the resurrection. And Matthew frames for us the story of Jesus's death and his

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,400
 resurrection by providing us details about his trial. That's the thing that

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,560
 that leads up to the story of his death, what Pilate as the governor of Jerusalem

35
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,800
 does in this moment. And Matthew is providing for us this idea of Jesus's

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,640
 trial and framing that for us so that we can understand something that is

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,360
 significant about Jesus that will help us to understand the power that is found

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,560
 in his death and resurrection. There's nothing in Matthew's gospel that is a

39
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,560
 waste and this story right here is the gateway through which he wants us to

40
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,160
 walk into understanding why Jesus had to die and what it is that Jesus does in

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,000
 the beauty of his resurrection. Now Matthew's presentation of the trial of

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,920
 Jesus is pretty similar to the other presentations that are found in the other

43
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,880
 Gospels except for one significant difference. Matthew and only Matthew

44
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,360
 provides one quick little short side story. A side story that isn't found in

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,120
 any of the other Gospels and a side story that sets up everything Matthew

46
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,080
 wants you to know about Jesus before he goes to the cross. And that little side

47
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,080
 story is just a 34 word passage that follows immediately after what I had

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,680
 just written. Let me read this to you from Matthew 27 verse 19. "While Pilate

49
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,880
 was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message, 'Don't have

50
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,280
 anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today

51
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:36,400
 in a dream because of him.'" Ah yes, a dream. And this dream found at the end of

52
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,000
 Matthew's gospel is one of the most unique dreams that we have in the whole

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,360
 of Scripture. It's unique for two primary reasons. First of all, this is the only

54
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,040
 dream in all the Scripture we have recorded to us that was given to a woman.

55
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,760
 It is also the only dream we have in Scripture that is described to us as a

56
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,240
 nightmare. And this is fascinating for us because Matthew is the gospel writer

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,720
 who brings dreams into the story of Jesus. In fact, dreaming provides the

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,880
 bookends around Matthew's presentation of the gospel. Pastor Ellison came to us a

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,120
 few weeks ago and told us about the dreams that God had given the Magi and

60
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,640
 Joseph right at the birth of Jesus. Those dreams were designed to protect Jesus

61
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,840
 from those that were planning to kill him, in that case the Roman Empire. And

62
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,600
 now right here at the end of Jesus's life, God gives another dream, this time

63
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,360
 to a Gentile woman, and that dream also is designed to protect Jesus from the

64
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,120
 people that are trying to kill him, and this time it's his own people. Pilate's

65
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,200
 wife gets this dream and this nightmare so shakes her, it so turns her upside

66
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,360
 down, that she wakes up early in the morning and she gets a message written

67
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,640
 and she sends this message to her husband and she says, "Whatever you do,

68
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,400
 don't have anything to do with this man." In other words, you need to deal with

69
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,400
 this straight away because she says these words, "He's innocent and if you do

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,920
 something to him when he's innocent, then an injustice is going to come." And she

71
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,200
 pleads on her husband to make the decision not to send him to his death,

72
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,760
 not to send him to a crucifixion, but actually to let him go. And history shows

73
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:27,640
 us that Pilate, like many other married men in history, ignores his wife's advice.

74
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:34,040
 And in ignoring his wife's advice, he brings into history perhaps the turning

75
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,280
 point of all history. He actually ends up releasing Jesus to the crowds so that he

76
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,080
 could be crucified. And I could stop preaching and just preach on that one

77
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,200
 point right now. In fact, if all the married men could stand up right now. No,

78
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,720
 just kidding, I'm not gonna do that, don't worry. But the reality is Pilate

79
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,560
 ignores what his wife pleads to him and the rest, as they say, is history. And

80
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,400
 here's what's crazy to me in this whole story. God gives Pilate's wife a

81
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,640
 nightmare that declares to her that Jesus is innocent, when actually God knew

82
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,240
 that Jesus still had to go to the cross. In other words, the dream wasn't gonna

83
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,720
 have any impact whatsoever on the outcome. In fact, God gives a dream which

84
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,600
 ironically is against everything that God is about to do in Jesus's death and

85
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,000
 resurrection. I wonder if you've ever thought of that. Why does God give

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Pilate's wife this dream when this dream is gonna have no impact whatsoever on

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,880
 the outcome of what's gonna happen for Jesus? And the answer to that question, my

88
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,920
 friends, the answer to that question, I think, has everything to say to us about

89
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:52,040
 why it is that we need to dream again here in Hong Kong in 2022. And I want to

90
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,280
 open up that idea to you as we unpack this passage of Scripture together today.

91
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,960
 At the most pivotal moment of Jesus's life, God gives this Gentile woman a

92
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,720
 disturbing dream. Now, Matthew doesn't tell us the content of Pilate's wife's

93
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,640
 dream. We don't understand exactly what she saw, how she saw it. All we know from

94
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,560
 the Scriptures here is that she understood the message of what that

95
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,000
 dream was. We get the message rather than the content. And the message was this. In

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,280
 fact, in the Greek she describes it this way. She describes Jesus as a just man. In

97
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,440
 the Greek, that just man means that he is innocent or righteous. The Word itself,

98
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,080
 and this is the really important thing, church, the Word itself carried with it

99
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:46,040
 themes of justice. So God gives Pilate's wife a dream, a nightmare in the middle

100
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,800
 of the night to understand the injustice that was about to happen to Jesus Christ.

101
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,900
 She, in this dream, and again we don't know the content, but we know that she

102
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,840
 was so shaken by this dream, so deeply disturbed by the injustice that was

103
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,160
 going to happen to an innocent man, that that injustice birthed within her a

104
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,120
 burden that she had to share, a burden that she had to declare no matter what

105
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,320
 the outcome might be. She knew that it would be up to Pilate, her husband, to

106
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,360
 make a decision. But this dream so disrupted something in her that she had

107
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:29,240
 to declare the innocence of Jesus into the situation itself. Now Matthew says

108
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,040
 something right here at the start of this passage that I think is so

109
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,400
 important. He says, "While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat," he uses this phrase,

110
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,920
 "the judge's seat." Now this phrase has two meanings to it. The first meaning is the

111
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,200
 one we take literally from the passage here. "As governor of Jerusalem, Pilate sat

112
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,040
 regularly on the judge's seat of the court." He would be the one that would

113
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,560
 judge ultimately whether somebody was guilty or not, and therefore Pilate had

114
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,200
 in his hands the power of life and death over pretty much anyone in Jerusalem. If

115
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,840
 they were brought to trial, he would sit in that judge's seat and he would make a

116
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,640
 judgment over whether they were guilty or not, over whether they should be

117
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,760
 punished or not, and ultimately over whether they should live or not. And

118
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,280
 here's the irony of this passage. This Greek phrase, "the judge's seat," is

119
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,200
 actually the phrase that's used from this point onwards to speak about Jesus'

120
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,560
 position in heaven after the resurrection. That Jesus has been raised

121
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:34,000
 from the dead and sat at the right-hand side of the Father, the judge's seat, over

122
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,840
 all of creation. And Matthew's trying to point out the fantastic irony that sat

123
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,800
 on this one simple passage, that over the judge's seat, Pilate was sitting to an

124
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,880
 innocent man, Jesus, and he's about to condemn an innocent man to his death. And

125
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,040
 the irony is, in the future, Jesus will sit on the ultimate judge's seat and

126
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,980
 will actually end up judging Pilate for what he's about to do. Now we don't know

127
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,040
 for sure, but a lot of scholars think that this might have been what it is

128
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,160
 that Pilate's wife wrestled with in that dream, that she might have come to

129
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,040
 understand that this innocent man, Jesus, was going to be the judge over all

130
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,080
 things, and that Pilate's actions in this moment were going to actually have major

131
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,920
 consequences to one who would sit eventually in the judgment over all

132
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,920
 creation. And she was so disturbed by that, that she found herself having to

133
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,600
 speak out. She says these words out of this dream, she says, "have nothing to do

134
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,800
 with this just man, this man of justice, this man of innocence, this righteous one.

135
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,720
 Have nothing to do with him. Don't do what you're about to do." In other words,

136
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,840
 she's saying, "do not judge the one who has the ultimate power to judge you. Do not

137
00:11:51,840 --> 00:12:00,000
 stand in that one's way." This message that she's proclaiming of Jesus's

138
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 innocence is so important here. You may not understand this, but it's so

139
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,880
 interesting to me that Pilate's wife is the only person in all the Gospels who

140
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,000
 actually declares Jesus's innocence before the crucifixion. There are many

141
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,080
 people post the crucifixion that point back to Jesus's innocence, but she's the

142
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,840
 only one recorded to us in all Scripture who declares that innocence prior to the

143
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,420
 crucifixion. Now when you understand that she's a Gentile woman declaring this to

144
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,680
 the court at the time, this will blow you away. You see, a woman in those days, her

145
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,880
 testimony had no legal ramifications at all in the Roman Empire. A woman's

146
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:48,760
 testimony had no legal impact in any trial at all. God takes the very vessel

147
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,600
 that could have no legal input into the trial of Jesus to declare his innocence.

148
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,000
 And we have to ask ourselves, "What is God doing here?" Well here's what he's doing.

149
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,400
 God is doing what his character has done throughout all of human history. He takes

150
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,720
 his counter-cultural message and he places it within a counter-cultural

151
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,520
 vessel. Come on church, this is really important for some of you to grasp a

152
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,840
 hold of this. Jesus so often uses the nameless for his glory. So often he

153
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,760
 steps in and he uses the ones who think they're nothing. The ones that

154
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,520
 have no, if you will, legal ramifications. The ones that don't think they have any

155
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,960
 power, any authority. Pilate's wife had no authority at all over the trial that

156
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,760
 Jesus was in, but she didn't care that she lacked authority. She knew that the

157
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,360
 message that she carried had all the authority that it needed and she was

158
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:51,120
 willing to proclaim that message even at the great cost of her own self. And this

159
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,360
 is so important for some of you listening this right now. Some of you

160
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,000
 watching this right now, you feel nameless yourself. You feel like you're

161
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,360
 weak. You feel like you don't have anything to offer. You feel like nobody

162
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,040
 really knows you or that you've got nothing to really do for the kingdom.

163
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,240
 You feel like you're insignificant, small and irrelevant. I want you to know this,

164
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,160
 that God throughout history has always used those people that feel like they

165
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,640
 are irrelevant to bring his message of power and glory almost all the time. And

166
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,920
 this is really important because when I think about the vine as a church, here's

167
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,840
 the truth of it. The glory of the vine is not going to come through the one or two

168
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,400
 individuals who are articulate and stand before cameras and preach God's Word. The

169
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,800
 glory of God at the vine is going to come through those that feel like they're

170
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,080
 lost in the crowd. The nameless ones, the ones who are scattered throughout the

171
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,600
 beauty of our congregation, people just like you who feel like perhaps you don't

172
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,640
 have a great thing to say. You don't have a platform for your voice and yet God

173
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,680
 is gonna so rock you with his dreams that you are gonna be the one, like

174
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,600
 Pilate's wife, to be able to declare things that no one else can declare.

175
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:18,360
 God wants to use you. And here's the great thing about that. Pilate's wife is

176
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,160
 used in this moment even though what she says doesn't impact what's actually

177
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,680
 going to happen. And when we ask ourselves why is God still giving her

178
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,920
 this message, here is the reason. Because Matthew wants us to know one thing about

179
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,560
 the death and resurrection of Jesus. That the whole gospel is formed on the beauty

180
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,580
 that he was innocent. The one thing we need to know about Jesus, even though it

181
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,280
 doesn't impact the outcome, is that he was actually innocent. The whole of our

182
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:55,240
 gospel is founded on that point. Our gospel is nothing less than the

183
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,200
 declaration to an evil and broken world that there is one who was willing to

184
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,240
 stand in the gap on our behalf. That there is one who was willing to take the

185
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,920
 judgment of sin and death on his shoulders so we might be free. That my

186
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:16,360
 friends is what the gospel is all about. It's about a blameless lamb that was

187
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,680
 sacrificed on our behalf. One who wasn't guilty. One who didn't have all of the

188
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,640
 sin and the brokenness that we have. Our gospel, if it's anything, is the

189
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,120
 beautiful reality that Jesus was innocent. And here's Pilate's wife

190
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,960
 declaring that innocence and God bringing that to her in a disturbing

191
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,400
 dream. Because he's saying this is what justice is all about. See there's this

192
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,400
 dream given to her that so breaks her for the injustice that's about to

193
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,280
 happen. That that injustice burns a burden in her to say that he is innocent

194
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,760
 even though that might not have any impact whatsoever to what might happen

195
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,280
 in his life. And I think justice so often must be like this. I think when we think

196
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,720
 about the work of social justice, when we think about the justice of the gospel, we

197
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,480
 so often think about it in end terms, like what it will achieve at the end. And

198
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
 we work for justice don't we? Because we want to change the laws. We want to shift

199
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,240
 things for the vulnerable and broken in our society. We want to see

200
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,320
 transformation come at this systemic level. And that's so often why we speak

201
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,560
 out in justice. And I love the fact that God has given us this story. Because it

202
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,280
 shows us something about justice that we so often don't actually see. That while

203
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,480
 of course the endgame is so often important, sometimes the declaration of

204
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,840
 the gospel is worth it, even if it's not going to shake the outcome. That sometimes

205
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,320
 it's worth us standing in the gap, even though perhaps the law doesn't get

206
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,760
 changed. Even perhaps even though the plight for those that suffer in our city

207
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,000
 might not shift. It's still worth it to declare before a broken world the truth

208
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,720
 of God. You see the importance of the gospel of justice, of justice gospel, is

209
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,160
 essentially the idea that we get to declare God's truth before the lives of

210
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:13,120
 this world. That we are able to speak forth the declaration of God's

211
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,040
 narrative to the injustices around us. That we get the great ability to

212
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,240
 actually send a message of God's revelation to the pilots of our time. And

213
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,880
 that in doing that, even if the outcome isn't what we would hope, there's still

214
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:39,040
 value in the declaration itself. I think this is so critical for us because I

215
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,720
 think what Matthew is trying to say to the church is this, are we willing to

216
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,440
 stand up for our convictions about Jesus, even when it feels like those

217
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,160
 convictions are not heard, seen, or acted on? Are we willing to hold the dreams of

218
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,400
 God in our heart, even when it feels like those dreams will not have an impact in

219
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,720
 the brokenness that is around us? If we learn anything from this passage, here's

220
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,480
 what we learn. We must continue to declare a Jesus who is innocent to a

221
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:22,160
 world that so often stills cries, "Crucify Him." That's part of our call. That's part

222
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,200
 of the gift of God that's upon us. And I want you to know this, that kind of

223
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:34,000
 dreaming is costly. That sort of dreaming always comes at a cost. It certainly

224
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,360
 came at a cost for Pilate's wife. Let me read you how she describes this. She says,

225
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,920
 "For I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of this innocent man. I

226
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:51,040
 have suffered so much in a dream because of him." I think this is so important. So

227
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,560
 often I think that we think that dreaming again is supposed to be easy

228
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,440
 and a lovely safe road, that it'll be a wonderful experience, that it will be a

229
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,600
 joy in the journey. Here's what we need to understand. That so often the dreams

230
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,840
 that God gives us, the dreams are not always dreams that are gonna bless us.

231
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,400
 Sometimes God gives us dreams that will disrupt us. Sometimes God will give us

232
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,120
 dreams that will actually cause a disruption inside of us. Sometimes

233
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,840
 God gives us dreams that give us a holy discontent in us, that shakes us

234
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,320
 out of the slumber of our comfortable lives. Sometimes the dreams that God

235
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,840
 brings us are dreams designed to dislodge something in us, that while

236
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,280
 might be painful in the process, puts a burden inside of us for justice in the

237
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,800
 gospel that couldn't be found in us that deep unless he had done it that way.

238
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,320
 Sometimes the dreams that he wants to bring us are not fun, are not comfortable,

239
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,840
 are not wonderful. They're the dreams of the gospel that are designed to put a

240
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,080
 holy dissatisfaction in God's people, to make them stand in a place of being

241
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,520
 uncomfortable for the gospel of Jesus. Why? Because that is the place that we so

242
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,760
 often have the ability to declare his truth even when it feels like nothing

243
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,880
 happens. And I think one of the great things that we find in this particular

244
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:25,080
 story is challenging questions. Are we willing to be shaken? Think about that

245
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:33,160
 for a sec. Are we willing, are we open to being shaken? Are we willing to ask for

246
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,120
 dreams that's gonna shake us out of our comfort and security? Are we willing to

247
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,280
 receive dreams that is actually going to potentially bring us into suffering and

248
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,720
 persecution for the gospel? In fact I want to say this actually more

249
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,280
 bluntly than that. I want to say this, I think the dreams that God wants to bring

250
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,160
 Christians in Hong Kong in this important hour are dreams that are not

251
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,800
 going to be comfortable for us to hear, receive, or live out. I think the time for

252
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,520
 dreaming comfortable dreams for Hong Kong is over. I think the kind of dreams

253
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,440
 that God wants to bring his church right now are dreams that will dislodge us,

254
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,320
 shake us out of our slumber. Dreams like the nightmare that Pilate's wife

255
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,880
 received. Dreams that help us to understand the sin that we're carrying

256
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,160
 as the church and enabling us to confess that sin, to leave the old behind so we

257
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,760
 can walk into the new that he has. The birthing pains in us that come only when

258
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,360
 God gives us dreams that pull us out of the slumber of the comfort of our lives

259
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,200
 and puts us in a place where we will actually maybe have to get a burden that

260
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,640
 will cause us to suffer a little bit for the glory of God in our lives. I want you

261
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,080
 to know this, that all of God's dreams that he gives you are for your good but

262
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,280
 oftentimes those dreams will invite you to suffer. These are the dreams

263
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,320
 that God gave Jesus. You know Jesus's dream, God's dream for Jesus was

264
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,680
 ultimately the cross of Jesus. Can you imagine that? The cross was his dream. A

265
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:15,560
 place of untold sacrifice and suffering. Excruciating pain was God's dream

266
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,400
 ultimately for Jesus. This was not a dream that I think anybody would have

267
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,960
 prayed for. In fact, this is a dream that Jesus himself tried to kind of leave out,

268
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,080
 pray out, get away in the Garden of Gethsemane, sweating blood like he was,

269
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,040
 saying to God, "Is there any other way?" But ultimately if this is your will, then

270
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,880
 your will be done. And if there's ever a universal dream that has been given to

271
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,280
 every single Christian, and if you're watching this right now and you're a

272
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,240
 Christian, this is the one dream that you can take to the bank that God has given

273
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,600
 you. It's this, that you are, if you want to follow Jesus, deny yourself, pick up

274
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,360
 your cross and follow him. In other words, the dream that God has for you is the

275
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,460
 same dream that he had for his Son. That God understands that if the power of the

276
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,100
 resurrection is going to be found in you, it's going to come first through the

277
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,600
 cross. It means that if we're going to follow Jesus, that there is some

278
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,960
 crucifixion that we will need to walk into. It means that if we want the joy of

279
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,480
 Easter Sunday and the power of the resurrection in us, there's going to be

280
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,760
 needing some death in us. That there is going to be needing some journey in us

281
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,560
 through the cross to that resurrection. I think the dreams that God so often wants

282
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,080
 to give us are not the dreams that we want. Oh, the dreams that will bless us,

283
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,320
 the dreams that will make us happy, the dreams that will fill our bank accounts,

284
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,040
 the dreams that will give us a platform, the dreams that will turn everybody

285
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,460
 towards us. No, so often the dreams that God gives us feel like nightmares when

286
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:47,720
 they come. The kind of dreams designed to shake the slumber off us and cause us to

287
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:55,640
 see again the beauty that there is in simply just proclaiming God's justice, no

288
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:04,440
 matter what the result might be. I think like Pilate's wife, are we willing

289
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,440
 through the path of suffering and trial to be truth tellers and truth speakers

290
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,680
 who through a holy dissatisfaction, a holy disruption by God, are now able to

291
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,960
 pronounce and declare the countercultural message of hope to a

292
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,040
 people trapped in darkness. What a joy that is ultimately, that we get to do

293
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,180
 that, that we get to be the ones that stand in the gap, that we get to be the

294
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,960
 ones if it's okay with this. As Paul says to the church in Corinth, that we through

295
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,760
 the gospel get to be the ones who are willing to take the dying side so that

296
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:54,800
 others might know the living side. That's a deep call of the gospel. Back in, back

297
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,600
 at the height of the protest movement in 2019, something happened at the end of my

298
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,240
 street in Causeway Bay that was a pivotal changing moment in my life when

299
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,720
 it came to the idea of what it is to dreaming again. I want to share this

300
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,440
 story with you. For a number of months there was tear gas happening in Causeway

301
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,120
 Bay on a regular basis. And on this particular morning I'd come down outside

302
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,680
 the front of my apartment and looking up the road that we lived on in Causeway

303
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,240
 Bay and right at the end of the street, around the corner of the street, out of

304
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,360
 my view, a gas canister had been, a tear gas canister had been let off. And all

305
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,400
 the protesters that had been in that area were now flooding down my street.

306
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,440
 They were running towards me and running past me as I stood there. And as I

307
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,520
 saw all these people panicking and running in this direction, I looked down

308
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,680
 the end of the street where that tear gas was coming from and I saw one man. I

309
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:54,040
 saw one man standing there who wasn't running in the opposite direction. In

310
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,960
 fact, that one man was standing there facing towards where the tear gas was

311
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,680
 coming from. Now at the start I thought this man was kind of being brave

312
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,440
 and trying to do some sort of, you know, non-violent resistance and sort of

313
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,320
 stand in front of the onslaught perhaps that was coming. But that actually wasn't

314
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,800
 what he was doing. In fact, this one person didn't look like at all the

315
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,320
 protesters around him. He wasn't dressed in black with the face mask that

316
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,400
 many of the frontline protesters were wearing in those days. He was just

317
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,120
 dressed normally and he was standing there. And I noticed as I looked at him,

318
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,800
 he was moving from side to side and I watched him and his mouth was

319
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,480
 communicating to the people that were running away. And he wasn't sort of

320
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,840
 trying to get them to stop running and turn around and fight. It wasn't that at

321
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,480
 all. I could tell just by his posture that he was offering comfort to those

322
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,200
 that were fleeing. That he was trying to offer some words of comfort to them, even

323
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,320
 as they were in that panicked state of running away. And I looked at that man

324
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,520
 and I thought this is phenomenal. His position was not political. It was

325
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,680
 pastoral. He wasn't down the end of the street like me, just a casual observer

326
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,120
 about what was going on. At the same time, he wasn't on the front line trying to

327
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,920
 fight. He was actually putting himself in the middle space where he was willing to

328
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,280
 stand and face towards the suffering that was about to come to him. I'm sure

329
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,240
 the stinging in his eyes must have been crazy. He was willing to do that in order

330
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,200
 to offer some hope and some healing to those that were fleeing past him. And I

331
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,080
 realised in that moment that man carried a different spirit in him that I did not

332
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,760
 carry in me. That he was perhaps more pastoral in that moment than I have been

333
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,200
 in 25 years of being a part of the Vine Church. I realised that that wasn't me.

334
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:56,120
 And in that place, I felt a dislodging of my spirit. It was not a comfortable thing

335
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,600
 at all. And here's what I heard the Holy Spirit say to me in that moment, as I'm

336
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,520
 just standing there on the street right outside my house. Here's what I heard the

337
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,040
 Holy Spirit say. He said, "Andrew, your city is going to need some deep healing.

338
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:15,480
 And like this man, it will only come through a suffering kind of love. My love,

339
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,060
 the love of the cross." And if we are to think about what it is to dream again

340
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,360
 for Hong Kong, I think we need to realise that the kind of love that we're gonna

341
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,360
 have to hold in our hearts for our city is a suffering kind of love. The kind of

342
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:38,080
 love that will place us as God's mouthpiece at the end of the street,

343
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,800
 offering comfort and hope, even whilst there is stinging in our eyes. That we

344
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:50,560
 might be the people that are willing to put ourselves in harm's way, so that the

345
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:57,680
 justice of the gospel would be declared. That we would be so ripped apart by the

346
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:04,120
 injustice that is happening around us, that we might be willing to stand in a

347
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:10,120
 place where even if it might be at our cost, the gospel would still be declared.

348
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,160
 I wonder whether we would be willing to ask for those kinds of dreams. I wonder

349
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,280
 whether we would be willing to be broken enough for the gospel in that kind of

350
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,380
 way. And my prayer for you as you're watching this, and I know that this is

351
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,720
 not a super "hey, everything's amazing" motivational message, but this is the

352
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,000
 honest God's truth for you. I pray that you won't just ask for dreams that are

353
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,120
 designed to bless you. I pray also that you'd be brave enough to ask for dreams

354
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,040
 that will disrupt you. I pray that you will ask for dreams that will shake you

355
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,640
 awake and enable you to break through and out of the place of comfort that so

356
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,720
 many of us feel. I pray that we would ask for dreams where we put the other in the

357
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,560
 limelight and not ourselves. I pray that we would ask for dreams that are designed

358
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,080
 to even enable us to be strong in the midst of the suffering that we might

359
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,200
 have to go through in order to see that dream come into a reality. I pray that

360
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,080
 you would have such a burning discomfort of the Holy Spirit in you, for the

361
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,060
 injustices that are happening around you, that you will do everything you can to

362
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,320
 declare the hope that is in Christ to the healing and the hurting and the

363
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,440
 vulnerable and the marginalized in our city. And I pray this, I pray, I pray that

364
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,500
 the gospel would be your great joy. I pray that the suffering love of Jesus

365
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:41,040
 would be your great strength. And I pray that the reconciliation of the broken

366
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,120
 people in our city would become our great call. I want to say those three

367
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,200
 things again to you. I pray that the gospel would be your great joy and I

368
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,760
 pray that the suffering sacrificial love of Jesus would be your great strength.

369
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,640
 And I pray that the reconciliation of the kingdom of God, the reconciliation of

370
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:10,040
 Jesus in our city at this time would be all of our great call. Church, it's time

371
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,760
 for us to dream again. But perhaps the dreams that God wants us to dream are

372
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,120
 not the warm and fuzzy, "Oh bless us" type dreams. Perhaps they're the dreams that are

373
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,880
 needed for Hong Kong in this hour. Dreams that will give us such a burden that

374
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,400
 we're willing to suffer for the gospel because of it. Dreams that don't always

375
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,720
 put the endgame at the front point of whether we're willing to declare or not.

376
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,200
 Dreams that enable us to say, "It's worth me just declaring the justice of God

377
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,160
 even if that doesn't happen to produce the end result that I truly see and

378
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:53,000
 believe." Are we willing like Pilate's wife to send a message because of the

379
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,120
 uncomfortable burden that God has placed upon us? I pray that you would be so

380
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,680
 shaken for the lost in Hong Kong that you cannot stay sidelined in a time like

381
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:11,000
 this. I pray that you would receive the fire of Jesus. May God disrupt the Vine

382
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,880
 Church so that the gospel in Hong Kong could truly be felt. I want to pray for us.

383
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:25,320
 Can we pray together? Father, we... it's not an easy word Lord, this is not a nice

384
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:32,040
 sweet inspirational thing. But Father, at the end of this long week Lord, I believe

385
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,160
 strongly that you're speaking to your church and you're saying, "Come on church,

386
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:44,560
 are you willing to stand up and be counted in this time? Are we willing to

387
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:53,400
 dream the kind of dreams that will shake us?" A few weeks ago I sensed this word

388
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,120
 over us as the Vine, and I don't just say this over the church, but I can

389
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,360
 say it I think over the Vine. I sensed this word because it was... I'm saying it

390
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:10,080
 over myself as well. I sensed this thing that there is a complete and utter power

391
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,280
 and a heart that God has right now for the lost in this city and there is a

392
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,360
 sleeping church. I don't say that to judge us per se, but I do say that

393
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,240
 because I think that's what's on God's Spirit for us. That we cannot be asleep

394
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,800
 in this important time. Lord, I thank you that you rocked Pilate's wife, that you

395
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,500
 rocked her awake with a dream that caused her to declare the one thing that

396
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,060
 needed to be known before the death and resurrection of Jesus. That your son was

397
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:48,760
 innocent and that the whole of the gospel was formed on that declaration of

398
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,280
 his innocence. Father, I pray that now. I pray, Lord, that you would place dreams

399
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,080
 in Christians across this church and across this city. Dreams that would

400
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:05,160
 wrestle us awake at night. Dreams that would not be comfortable and easy. Dreams

401
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:12,080
 that would dislodge sin in our lives. Dreams, Lord, that would place us in a

402
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:19,120
 position where we're willing to suffer for the gospel. Dreams, Lord, that even if

403
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,880
 persecution would come, we would know that you are with us, Lord. Lord, I pray for

404
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,980
 this for me. I pray because I believe that this is the church that you're

405
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,840
 moving the Church of Hong Kong into. God, I just ask that you would release this

406
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,280
 right now. I want to pray for you in your home where you are, where you're watching

407
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:47,640
 this right now. I want to pray that the Holy Spirit would come in power over you.

408
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:57,280
 You are not nameless. You are not faceless. You have value and you have a

409
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:08,080
 gift. If God can use a Gentile who had no power in the court to speak his gospel

410
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:14,040
 God can use every single one of us. I want you to know that God wants to place

411
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:20,160
 upon you a burden. That he's calling you to pick up your cross and follow him.

412
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,560
 That he wants to break your heart for this city like never before. That God

413
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,920
 wants to give you a burden for the people who are lost, anxious, afraid,

414
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,920
 fearful. And we know that so often that is ourselves. And so we bring those

415
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,460
 things to Christ so that he can fill us with his peace, so that we can then be

416
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:48,080
 his mouthpiece. I pray you'd be so shaken that you cannot but not declare the

417
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,120
 goodness of God in the land of the living.

418
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:59,880
 Father, would you make us this people? Father, will we deal with our sin, Lord?

419
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,720
 I just want to say that over you. Deal with your sin. And while none of us are

420
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,240
 perfect, I believe that the bride that Hong Kong needs is a bride that has let

421
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:19,440
 go of the sins of its past. New wine for this new wineskin. The Holy Spirit loves

422
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:26,800
 you so much. Deal with your sin. Release it to him.

423
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:37,000
 Let him dislodge the stuff that's keeping you tied to comfort.

424
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,600
 Because Hong Kong is not a comfortable place to live right now. And if our

425
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:51,880
 primary objective is to seek comfort, we may be in temptation to hide ourselves

426
00:37:51,880 --> 00:38:00,640
 away and to stand down that street like I was, being a distant observer to the

427
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,880
 need that's in our city. I want to pray that you would be like that man that I

428
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:12,440
 saw on that day, facing forwards towards the difficulty, being pastoral and

429
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:19,620
 offering hope, even at the cost of his own suffering. I pray that would be the

430
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:25,960
 church. Lord, that's our vision. That's my vision for the vine. That we would be

431
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,800
 that church, Lord.

432
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:44,520
 I pray you do that, Lord. Whatever it takes, Lord, for our city, for people here.

433
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,280
 We pray this Lord, in your name.
