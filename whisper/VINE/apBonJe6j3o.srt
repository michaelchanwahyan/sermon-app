1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
 It's good to have you here.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,800
 So good.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
 Well, Happy New Year, everyone.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,000
 How's everyone doing?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,600
 Happy New Year?

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,800
 Oh, that was bad.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,000
 We're going to try that one more time.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,600
 Happy New Year, everybody.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,400
 Yeah, you guys did well.

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,900
 You got up for the 11 o'clock service.

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,300
 Well done.

12
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,200
 The really faithful people here at 915.

13
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,500
 I'm just pointing it out.

14
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,700
 Just pointing it out.

15
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,300
 The really dedicated people here at 915.

16
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,400
 There's about 50 of us in this room, loving Jesus together.

17
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,800
 But we're glad, we're glad that we have a full house at the 11.

18
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
 It's so good to see you guys.

19
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,600
 In honor of Pele, who passed away this week,

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,000
 I want to start my very first sermon of 2023 with a story about football.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,800
 I know.

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,000
 In the fall of 1989,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,900
 I was selected to play football for the Hong Kong national team.

24
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,300
 Yes. Admittedly, it was the under 14 team.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,900
 But it was the Hong Kong national football team nonetheless.

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,700
 I was selected along with 24 other school boys to play for Hong Kong.

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,800
 And the reason why we were putting a team together for the under 14s,

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,200
 because there was an upcoming football tournament against China, Indonesia, Philippines and Macau.

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,500
 The mighty football powerhouse of Macau.

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,300
 And so they put this team together of 25 of the best footballing school boys in Hong Kong.

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,000
 And I was pretty proud to be selected for this team.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,100
 I wasn't quite sure why I was selected, but I was pretty proud.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,700
 I was playing pretty good football for South Island School, the school that I was at at the time.

34
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,000
 And I was selected.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,800
 So I showed up to that very first practice.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,600
 And you know what that would be like, right?

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,900
 You're selected, but you don't know any of the other boys that have been selected.

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,100
 And you're standing there.

39
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,100
 And in that first practice, there's a lot of nerves.

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,300
 There's some excitement, right?

41
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,600
 You're excited. You're going to play together.

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,400
 But there's nerves. And you're all checking each other out.

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,800
 Like, who's the best player in the team, right?

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,600
 Well, after about half an hour, it was pretty obvious to myself and to the coaches

45
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,900
 that I was the worst player in the team.

46
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,800
 The worst player out of the 24 players.

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,700
 I was terrible.

48
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,000
 In fact, the standard of all the other guys was so much higher than me

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,200
 that I was wondering why was I selected in the first place.

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,800
 And I began to understand that it was because I'm actually a left-footed player.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,300
 And I like to play in the left back of defense.

52
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,400
 Nobody likes to play on the left back of defense.

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,800
 And I'm a left-foot player who plays in the left back of defense.

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,300
 In other words, they were desperate to find somebody in the position that I played in.

55
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,300
 And so they selected me to play in that position.

56
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,800
 It was pretty dire that I was as bad as I was compared to everybody else.

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,600
 On the night before the tournament, it was clear to me that I was not going to play any game whatsoever.

58
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,300
 And this was just illustrated even more that during that night

59
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,400
 where they were discussing strategy for how they were going to beat all these teams,

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,100
 they also had some fun in coming up with awards for the team.

61
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,400
 I was voted the least likely to score.

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,400
 Which I understand because you actually have to play to score, right?

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,300
 And I knew I was not going to play.

64
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,500
 So I was voted least likely to score.

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,300
 The expectation of the team was that even if I could get some time on the pitch

66
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:48,400
 and the ball came towards me and the goal was open and there was no one around,

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,700
 I would still fluff the shot and miss.

68
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,000
 Well, we got thrashed by China, by Indonesia, and by the Philippines.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,700
 And then came Macau.

70
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,700
 If there was one team that we thought we could beat, it was Macau.

71
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,900
 Since when did they play good football in Macau?

72
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,300
 So our coach, wanting to salvage some pride, selected the best team he had against Macau.

73
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,400
 We had not scored a goal the whole tournament, right?

74
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,100
 And he wanted to right those wrongs.

75
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,600
 So he had the best team.

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,000
 I didn't even qualify for the best 24.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,100
 So here's the thing.

78
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,700
 Although I was in the squad that day and I had the squad outfit on

79
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,800
 and I had my boots on and everything like that,

80
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
 I wasn't even on the bench.

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,500
 There was no room for me on the bench.

82
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
 I was in the stands with the fans.

83
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,900
 That's where I was.

84
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,300
 True story.

85
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,300
 My mom was so upset.

86
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,100
 By halftime against Macau, it's nil-nil.

87
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,300
 Nothing's happened.

88
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,100
 At the beginning of the second half, our star left midfielder is brought down

89
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,700
 by a horrendous tackle by his counterpart from Macau.

90
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,200
 I mean, it was such a bad tackle.

91
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,600
 And the team of physios came on the field.

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,700
 They put him on a stretcher.

93
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,500
 They carried him off.

94
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,800
 And the coach suddenly realized he needed to replace him with a left-footed player.

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,200
 He desperately searched the bench for a left-footed player and did not find one.

96
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,800
 And so with the slowest head turn I have ever seen, he looked desperately to the stands.

97
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,100
 His eyes caught my eyes.

98
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,700
 And I'm sitting forward there like this, right?

99
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:39,400
 He keeps looking past me as if he was going to pull a fan out of the stands to come play.

100
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,000
 His eyes eventually come back to me.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And with the most reluctant hand signal I have ever seen, he calls me up for my international football debut.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,200
 I run onto the pitch so fast because I'm so excited.

103
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,900
 I run all the way to the center circle before I realize that I'm actually playing left in midfield.

104
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,900
 So I run back to the left-hand side of the pitch.

105
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,300
 This is not going well.

106
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
 The game starts again.

107
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,500
 It is fast-paced and furious.

108
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,200
 But we're actually doing okay.

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,200
 And at one moment, about 10 minutes in, we break down the right-hand side of the pitch.

110
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,100
 The whole team surges forward.

111
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,300
 I go along with everybody else, not really knowing what I'm doing.

112
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,500
 I end up in the outside of the left-hand corner of the box.

113
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:35,400
 Our right-foot, right-hand midfielder crosses the ball in, and the whole stadium pauses.

114
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,100
 Now, it was about the worst cross you've ever seen in your life.

115
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,500
 It was a terrible cross.

116
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,300
 And as soon as the guy kicked it, we all knew that none of us were going to get it, that

117
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,200
 the goalkeeper was going to come out and very easily grab a hold of it.

118
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,400
 Well, sure enough, the ball is coming in from the right-hand side.

119
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,600
 The goalkeeper comes out to grab it.

120
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,300
 And I guess he had a brain fart because he totally misses the ball, like totally misses it.

121
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,000
 And because everybody else is so surprised because they were guaranteed that the goalkeeper

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,600
 was going to get it, when he missed it, all the other players missed it too.

123
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,500
 And the ball came, and it landed right in front of me.

124
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,400
 I was so scared.

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
 I was scared that the football was going to hit me in the face.

126
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,800
 It was going to bounce off the ground and smack me in the face.

127
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
 So here's what I did, okay?

128
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,200
 I was so scared, I wanted to protect myself.

129
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,700
 I went, "Ahh!"

130
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,500
 Just like that.

131
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,200
 I kid you not.

132
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,000
 I'll do it again.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,400
 "Ahh!"

134
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,900
 My right foot magically connected at exactly the right moment as the ball bounced.

135
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,700
 It was the best half-volley you had ever seen in your life.

136
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,300
 Even though I was trying to avoid pain, the ball flew off my right foot and like a lightning bolt,

137
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,100
 steamed into the top right-hand corner of the net.

138
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,500
 Yes!

139
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,200
 Yes!

140
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,900
 I scored!

141
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,700
 I couldn't believe it.

142
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,400
 I scored!

143
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,500
 Even though I was like, "Yeah!"

144
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,100
 It was amazing.

145
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,500
 All my teammates came around me.

146
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,100
 "Oh my God!"

147
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,400
 And here's what they were saying, "Oh my God!

148
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
 You scored!

149
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:15,900
 You scored!

150
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,900
 It was you!

151
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,200
 It was you!"

152
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:28,700
 The one voted least likely to score, defied expectations, scored the winning goal,

153
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,400
 the only goal we ever scored in the whole tournament,

154
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,000
 and we beat Macau!

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,200
 Come on!

156
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,000
 All right.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,800
 Yes, yes.

158
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,300
 I'm in the flesh right here with you.

159
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,900
 I'll sign anything after the service, anything at all.

160
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,400
 I will sign it.

161
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:56,700
 As we start 2023, I wonder what expectations you have for the year ahead.

162
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,900
 I wonder what expectations you have for yourself personally, for your work, your career,

163
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,200
 for your relationships, people in your life.

164
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,700
 I wonder what your expectations are even for God, for what He might do in your life this year,

165
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,600
 for how He might work in you and around you.

166
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,200
 I wonder where your expectations are as you start this new year.

167
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,500
 Because here's the reality, every single one of us, we always have expectations.

168
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,800
 In fact, our expectations shape and form everything that we think and we do.

169
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,900
 And most of the expectations we carry, formed by years and years of past experience,

170
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,400
 actually sit in our subconscious, and we don't even realize that they are there,

171
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,100
 and we don't consciously engage with our expectations when we go about our lives.

172
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,900
 I'll give you an example.

173
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,300
 When you came into the auditorium today and you found a chair,

174
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,600
 you actually sat down in that chair with the subconscious expectation

175
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,900
 that the chair would not collapse.

176
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,300
 You just, because of your past experience, have always sat in a chair that looks like this.

177
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,800
 It looks like it's going to hold your weight.

178
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,000
 You don't even think about it.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,700
 You sit down.

180
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,500
 Lo and behold, the chair holds your weight.

181
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,600
 It confirms that subconscious expectation, and you continue with your life.

182
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,900
 Your expectations shape everything that you do.

183
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,700
 Are you with me?

184
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,200
 Now, here's the thing.

185
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,000
 What expectations have shaped how you feel about 2023?

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 For some of us in this room, you've had a really tough 2022.

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,800
 It's been really hard, really difficult.

188
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,000
 There's been some tough stuff going on in your life.

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,700
 There's been some struggle and some hardship and some suffering, perhaps.

190
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,100
 Maybe you've made some mistakes that you're not proud of and you're still wrestling with.

191
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,000
 And your experiences of 2022 have now shaped an expectation in you

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 that 2023 is probably going to be a little bit of the same.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,700
 It's probably not going to be the best year ahead.

194
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
 It's probably not going to be great.

195
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,800
 You're probably not that excited about it.

196
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,900
 You're thinking, "Well, it was really tough '22.

197
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,500
 I'm kind of bringing a lot of that tough.

198
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,800
 I'm exhausted.

199
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 I just don't think this is going to be so great.

200
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,100
 I can't wait for 2024.

201
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,400
 Maybe that'll be better," right?

202
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,700
 If you've had a tough 2022, no doubt your expectations for 2023 will come alongside that.

203
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,100
 And it's the same if you had a great 2022.

204
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,600
 Some of you in this room had the best 2022 of your life.

205
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,700
 You had an amazing year.

206
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,600
 Your career went well.

207
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,700
 Things went great.

208
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,400
 You did some things that weren't expected.

209
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,300
 You actually achieved more than you had thought.

210
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,800
 And so as you lean into 2023, those things have shaped your expectations,

211
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
 and you're excited about 2023.

212
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,700
 You're excited about it.

213
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,900
 You're hoping it's going to be great.

214
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,800
 "Well, it was great before.

215
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
 It's going to be great again."

216
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,100
 There's no reason to feel any other differently.

217
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,500
 And so here is the sobering reality when we step into a new year.

218
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,100
 It is not your New Year's resolutions that are going to shape your life.

219
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,900
 It is not your five-year plan that ultimately is going to shape who you are.

220
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,300
 It's not going to be the goals you've set yourself to lose a bit of fat,

221
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,900
 to get fit for the new year.

222
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,000
 It's not those things that are ultimately going to shape your 2023.

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,900
 Here's what's going to shape your 2023, the expectations you're holding right now.

224
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,500
 Those are going to be the things that are going to either set up this year for success

225
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,400
 for you or not.

226
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,900
 And here's the reality.

227
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:16,300
 So often, our expectations keep us on the bench when we should be playing on the pitch.

228
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:23,700
 So often, your expectations will hold you back rather than release you into what it might be

229
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,300
 that God wants you to experience.

230
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,800
 As I was praying for us as a church about two months ago,

231
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,500
 as I was thinking about what 2023 might be like for us,

232
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,400
 it was this idea of expectations that I felt God put on my heart.

233
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,600
 This idea of challenging you in your thought process around the expectations that you hold.

234
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,200
 And as I was praying for you, I felt a funny emotion.

235
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,400
 It was this strong emotion of excitement and exhilaration in my heart.

236
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,800
 Like, literally, like, I am so excited for what this year is going to be ahead for you.

237
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,200
 I am so excited, and I feel it in my spirit as we're doing our services today,

238
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,100
 as I'm standing here with you right now.

239
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,700
 I feel this sense of exhilaration about how amazing stuff is going to be this year.

240
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,300
 And the reason why I feel that way is because in critical moments of history,

241
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,800
 and if we're honest with ourselves, Hong Kong is in a critical moment of its history.

242
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,900
 God always comes and does something new.

243
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,300
 I mean, if you look through Scripture, you'll see that in critical moments of history,

244
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,700
 God always steps in and He does something new,

245
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,900
 something that He's never done before, something that shapes God's people for something in their future.

246
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,900
 And I feel and sense as I was praying for this year that this is the year for Hong Kong.

247
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,200
 God is about to do something new in our city, something of hope, something of life,

248
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,900
 something of positivity, something that's going to grow and change and bring this place much hope and joy.

249
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,200
 God has it on His heart because this is His character.

250
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,700
 He wants to step into the hard moments, step into the difficult times,

251
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:12,300
 and do something so profound, so unexpected, so new that the world shifts on its axis.

252
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,800
 And if you're anything like me, there might be something in your heart that's saying,

253
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,000
 "God, I need the new. I desire this new thing to come to shape and to form in me.

254
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,800
 I want to experience what that would be like, God, for you to come and do something like you have never done before."

255
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,400
 In the Bible, when it describes this word new in the Greek version of the Old Testament and the New Testament,

256
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,700
 there are two Greek words for new, "neos" and "kainos."

257
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,100
 Neos means something new from something that is old.

258
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:56,000
 Kainos means something completely brand new that's never existed before.

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,900
 So there are two emphases when you read Scripture and you see the word new.

260
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,900
 It could be one of those two words, either just something new from something old,

261
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,400
 something that's being created out of something before,

262
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,900
 or kainos, new, something that has never been created, never happened before.

263
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,800
 It's a completely brand new thing.

264
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,000
 And as I was praying for us, I felt like God was saying,

265
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,600
 "I'm about to release this kainos kind of work over the people of the vine,

266
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:29,800
 and I got so excited for you because God is about to do something in you that he's never done before."

267
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:41,500
 And the challenge is, as we start the new year, do we expect it or not?

268
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,300
 Let me show you a passage of Scripture that I think is so relevant for this time of history that Hong Kong is in,

269
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,500
 and so relevant for us as we lean into this thought of God doing something new.

270
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,100
 It's from Isaiah chapter 43, and it's just a few verses.

271
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,000
 Let me read this to us.

272
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 This is what the Lord says,

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 "He who has made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters,

274
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,100
 who drew out the chariots and the horses, the army and the reinforcements together,

275
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,100
 and there laid them, never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick,

276
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,900
 forget the former things.

277
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,400
 Do not dwell on the past.

278
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,300
 See, I'm doing a new thing.

279
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,000
 Now it springs up.

280
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
 Do you not perceive it?

281
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
 I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.

282
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,800
 The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls,

283
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,300
 because I provide water in the desert and streams in the wasteland to give drink to my people,

284
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,300
 my chosen people, the ones that I'd formed for myself,

285
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,500
 so that they may proclaim my praise."

286
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,300
 God uses Isaiah to show up in a critical moment of Israel's history and say,

287
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,900
 "Wake up, Israel, because I'm doing something new."

288
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,700
 It won't surprise you that the word "new" there in the Greek version of the Old Testament

289
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,500
 is "kainos", a brand new thing.

290
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,300
 Now, context is so important here,

291
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,700
 because when Isaiah brings this prophetic word,

292
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,300
 it's at a moment of great difficulty for Israel.

293
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,000
 They've been at this point about 70 years in captivity in Babylon.

294
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 The Babylonian army had stormed into Jerusalem 70 years before,

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,800
 destroyed their walls, destroyed their temple, killed many of them,

296
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,700
 and a remnant of Israel had been brought back to captivity in Babylon.

297
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,900
 And for 70 years, they've been there in captivity.

298
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,600
 For 70 years, they've had a theological crisis whilst they've been in isolation.

299
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,800
 And isolation has created a theological crisis in them.

300
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,200
 Where is God? What is he doing? Is he going to show up?

301
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,100
 Will things ever be like they will be again?

302
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,100
 And in the midst of that brokenness, God shows up.

303
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,400
 And if you're anything like me,

304
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,100
 when I think about the context of Isaiah chapters 40 to 66,

305
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,500
 that's the chapters where God begins to speak this hope into Israel

306
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
 in a really difficult time for them.

307
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,900
 When I think about that context, I think about us.

308
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,900
 I think about how relevant this is for us here in Hong Kong.

309
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,900
 We know that the last number of years have been super hard here.

310
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,400
 We know that because of COVID,

311
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
 we've been in a season of isolation from one another,

312
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,400
 just like Israel was in a season of isolation from their homeland.

313
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,600
 We know that just like Israel had been whittled from the 12 tribes

314
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,000
 right down to like a remnant remaining,

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 we know that many people have left Hong Kong in the last year or two.

316
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,600
 We know that it almost feels like there's a remnant of us left in the city now,

317
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,100
 wondering and hoping for what's ahead.

318
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,200
 And just like that, there's been a theological crisis for many of us during COVID.

319
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,100
 When churches were shut down and the doors of the churches weren't open,

320
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,000
 so many of us struggled with our faith.

321
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,400
 We're in isolation.

322
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,600
 Where is God?

323
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,100
 When will things get back to how they were before?

324
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,800
 Everything we felt in the last year or two is exactly how Israel was feeling

325
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,700
 when they're in this time of captivity and God breaks into that time

326
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,900
 and he says, "Forget the former things.

327
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,400
 Do not dwell on the past.

328
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,600
 See, I'm doing a new thing.

329
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,400
 See, I'm doing a kainos thing, a new thing that I've never done before."

330
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,700
 And the question we should ask is,

331
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,000
 what was that new thing that God was about to do for Israel that he had never done before?

332
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 You want to know what it is?

333
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,700
 Jesus.

334
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,300
 It was the Messiah.

335
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:40,700
 This is the starting point of Israel's journey to encountering the hope in their spirit

336
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,700
 for a coming Messiah who would right the world's wrongs.

337
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,800
 It begins right here by God saying, "I'm doing a new thing amongst you,

338
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,100
 one that is kainos, not ever before thought of.

339
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,300
 It's not a new thing from an old thing.

340
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,300
 This is a brand new thought, a brand new day, a brand new moment,

341
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,100
 and I'm doing it amongst you.

342
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,700
 Jesus is going to come."

343
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,100
 Although Isaiah doesn't specifically say it here,

344
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,700
 we know from history that this is the turning point for Israel

345
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,300
 where they begin to believe that a Messiah might come

346
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,900
 who could save them from the pain of the world.

347
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,000
 That's this moment, a new thing.

348
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,200
 And God says this to them.

349
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,000
 What a challenge. He says, "Do you not perceive it?"

350
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,700
 Do you not perceive it?

351
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
 He says to Israel, "I'm doing a new thing."

352
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,000
 He doesn't say, "I'm going to do a new thing."

353
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,800
 He doesn't say, "Hey, wait, in a couple of months' time, I'm going to do this amazing thing."

354
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,600
 He's like, "Right now, I'm doing a new thing.

355
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,100
 I've already started the journey of that new thing.

356
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,700
 I've already brought birth into the world, the spirit and the idea,

357
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,700
 and what I'm about to do that is going to come out in the flesh so many years later.

358
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,900
 But I've begun that process now.

359
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,500
 Do you not perceive it?"

360
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,300
 Which has an implication in it, you aren't seeing it.

361
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,400
 And I want to declare over you in a prophetic way at the start of this year,

362
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,900
 God is also doing a new thing in Hong Kong.

363
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,800
 In a critical time of our history, I believe He's doing a new thing,

364
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,100
 a thing He's never done before.

365
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,700
 And I want to say this, He's doing it in your life as well.

366
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,700
 There is a new thing God is doing around you.

367
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:29,100
 And I wonder whether we are ever at danger of not perceiving the new thing God is doing,

368
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,100
 and therefore relying on the old thing He's done before.

369
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,300
 My heart for you, as you step into 2023,

370
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:45,400
 is that your relationship with Jesus will be so fresh, so new, so exciting, so overwhelming,

371
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,700
 that you could not even have a framework for it before.

372
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,000
 That could help describe to you right in this moment what is about to happen to you.

373
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,800
 He is doing a new thing.

374
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,500
 Do you not perceive it?

375
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,500
 This is why He starts with, "See, I'm doing a new thing."

376
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,400
 He's not saying, He's not like a magician going, "See, I'm doing a new thing."

377
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
 You know, that's not what He's saying.

378
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,200
 He's saying this, "See, I'm doing a new thing."

379
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,200
 So see, I'm doing a new thing.

380
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,500
 So open your eyes and see it.

381
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,600
 I'm doing this new thing.

382
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,200
 Can you not perceive it?

383
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,600
 See it.

384
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,900
 I'm doing a new thing amongst you.

385
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,500
 And the excitement of this is for Israel to go,

386
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,500
 "Are we seeing? Are we perceiving? Are we connecting with this?"

387
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,000
 And as we start 2023,

388
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,200
 there are new things that are happening in and around your life that God is doing.

389
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,800
 And your question is, "Am I failing to see the new?

390
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,700
 Am I positioned at the start of this year to see the new thing God is doing or not?"

391
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,400
 And I want to offer to you two things

392
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,700
 that will stop you perceiving the new thing God is going to do in your life.

393
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,400
 Is that helpful?

394
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,800
 Are you still around?

395
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,600
 Hello, church.

396
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,100
 I'm going to give you two things that will stop you perceiving the new.

397
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,300
 There are many things, but here are two.

398
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,000
 The first is you look in the wrong place.

399
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,900
 You look for the new thing God is going to do in the wrong place.

400
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,600
 Let me explain that.

401
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,000
 At the start of every new year, what is the thing that we talk about the most?

402
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,500
 What new thing are you doing this year?

403
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,400
 Hey, you look like you could lose some weight.

404
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,100
 Are you doing a fast this year?

405
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,800
 New body? New job? New goals?

406
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,400
 Have you set your new goals for the year?

407
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,000
 What's your new word for the year?

408
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,900
 Has God given you your new word yet for the year?

409
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,800
 So often when we're looking for the new thing that God is doing,

410
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,200
 we actually really just have the language about the new things we're doing.

411
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,900
 We actually end up looking at the new changes,

412
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,500
 the things that we think we need to change in us,

413
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
 and we kind of attribute that to what God is doing.

414
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,300
 God does not show up to Israel here and say,

415
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,400
 "Behold, you're doing a new thing.

416
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
 Time to fast. Woo-hoo! Right?

417
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,900
 Time to get the better body, the better job, the better bank account.

418
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,300
 It's your time," God is saying.

419
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,100
 That's not what He's saying at all to Israel.

420
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,800
 At a critical moment in their history,

421
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,200
 He doesn't turn to them and challenge them to do new things.

422
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,900
 He says, "I'm the one doing the new thing."

423
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,500
 That's not your role.

424
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,400
 And there's nothing wrong with news resolutions.

425
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
 There's nothing wrong with goals or five-year plans.

426
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,900
 There's nothing wrong with a better body.

427
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,700
 All of that might be excellent in your life,

428
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,900
 might really help to serve your life.

429
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,400
 But your hope, your salvation,

430
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,000
 what God is doing in this world is not started by you setting some good new goals.

431
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,300
 God is already at work doing the new.

432
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,200
 It's God's work, not yours.

433
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,400
 Our role is not to create something new in the new year.

434
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,700
 God's role is to create something new.

435
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,800
 Our role is to discover it.

436
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,700
 Our role is to perceive it.

437
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,300
 And in perceiving it, embracing it for ourselves.

438
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,800
 You want to change tremendously this year?

439
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,900
 You want the best year for your life?

440
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,200
 Work out what God is doing in this world.

441
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,300
 Work out what He's doing in Hong Kong.

442
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,700
 Work out what He's doing in and around your life.

443
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,300
 And magnify that, embrace that, receive that.

444
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,700
 Open your eyes to it.

445
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,500
 The best way we change is not by trying to get some better habits in our life,

446
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,900
 as good as those might be.

447
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,300
 The best way we change is by going,

448
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,700
 "God is doing this. What does that mean for this?"

449
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,800
 Are you with me?

450
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,000
 One of the reasons why we miss out on the new thing

451
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 is because we're looking in the wrong place.

452
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,800
 So often, we miss out on the very new thing that God wants to do in and around our lives

453
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:57,100
 because we are so busy trying to create that new thing ourselves.

454
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,900
 And for some of you, that's a word in season right at the start of this year.

455
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,300
 He's saying, "Stop trying so hard.

456
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,800
 Stop trying to create in you the new thing that I can only create,

457
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,100
 that I can only do.

458
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,900
 I'm doing a new thing.

459
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,700
 Open your eyes."

460
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,300
 Here's the second thing that will stop us from perceiving the new thing.

461
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,700
 And it's why I started the message with my funny story about football.

462
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,900
 It's expectations.

463
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,200
 Your expectations will often stop you

464
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,300
 from seeing the very things that God is doing in your life.

465
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,100
 This is actually the reason that God draws attention to in this passage.

466
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,800
 I want to show you this from verse 16.

467
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,900
 Let me read this to us again.

468
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,300
 Is everybody still okay?

469
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
 Is this helping anyone?

470
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,700
 Good. Over here on the left. I like it.

471
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,500
 Left. See, left-footed, left side. Good.

472
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,900
 This is what the Lord says.

473
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,800
 "He who made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters,

474
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,500
 who drew out the chariots and the horses and the army and the reinforcements together

475
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,700
 and lay them there, never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick,

476
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,200
 forget the former things, do not dwell on the past.

477
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,500
 See, I'm doing a new thing."

478
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
 It blows my mind what God does here.

479
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,500
 He goes right back to a very fundamental time in Israel's history.

480
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,000
 Right before he says, "I'm doing a new thing,"

481
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,900
 God describes an old thing He has done.

482
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,600
 Not just an old thing, but the greatest old thing He's ever done for them.

483
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,900
 He says, "To he who has made a way through the sea."

484
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,400
 What is He talking about there?

485
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
 Come on, everybody.

486
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,900
 What's He talking about?

487
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,100
 I heard it over here.

488
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,600
 Red Sea. Exodus, right?

489
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,700
 He's going back to the most fundamental moment

490
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,700
 that actually defines the modern nation of Israel.

491
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
 That moment where God passed the Red Sea,

492
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,100
 Israel was able to get through, the evading Egyptian army follows after them,

493
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,900
 the seas come back, all the chariots get messed up,

494
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,400
 they get snuffed out, never to appear again, as it says right here.

495
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,700
 God takes them back to the greatest moment of His activity ever that He's ever done in life.

496
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,900
 In fact, it is the greatest miracle that He's ever done

497
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,400
 that shaped and molded Israel as the nation itself.

498
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,600
 And then He says, "Forget the former things."

499
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,100
 Do not dwell on the past.

500
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,500
 Hang on a sec.

501
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,600
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a sec.

502
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,100
 It's like God is saying, "Hey, do you remember the most amazing thing I've ever done in your life?

503
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,900
 The thing that totally changed your life?

504
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,400
 The thing that made you the best person that you've ever been?

505
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
 You remember that moment?

506
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,900
 Remember when I split the Red Sea and you guys remember that?

507
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,300
 Well, here's the thing.

508
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,700
 I want you to forget about it.

509
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,700
 I don't want you to think about it anymore.

510
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,000
 I want you to let it go.

511
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,900
 Why?

512
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:49,700
 Because that moment in your past is blinding you to the new thing I'm about to do.

513
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,500
 Even the really good thing in your past is blinding you to the new reality.

514
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,200
 Because guess what? I'm doing a kynos work.

515
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,500
 It means it's never existed before.

516
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,700
 It means that your expectations in the past won't actually help you in what I'm about to do.

517
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,200
 It'll only blind you.

518
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:12,900
 You'll only be holding on to the God who parts the seas when I'm about to be a God who becomes a human in flesh.

519
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,400
 You never expected that.

520
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
 You never thought that was going to happen.

521
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,700
 So let go of the former things, even the great stuff,

522
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:26,000
 because it's creating a box that you've put me in and I'm about to break that box.

523
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,200
 And if you think I'm just a God who parts the seas, as great as that is,

524
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,700
 you're not ready for the God who's about to act.

525
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,800
 Paul, in a different way, says it like this.

526
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:45,700
 Our God is able to do immeasurably more than I could ever ask or imagine.

527
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,900
 See, the new thing God wants to do in your life is immeasurably more than you could ever ask or imagine.

528
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,700
 The new thing he wants to do in our city is immeasurably more than we could ever ask or imagine.

529
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:02,700
 And we are so boxed in by all the things that have happened before,

530
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:09,700
 when God wants to free us so we can see again.

531
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,800
 Now, it's easy, isn't it?

532
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,700
 In fact, it sounds great when I tell you, "Hey, let go of the bad stuff."

533
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,300
 You know, we read a passage like this, "Hey, forget the former things. Do not dwell on the past."

534
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,700
 We're like, "Oh, thank you, Jesus, man. Yeah, because I made some messed up things in the past.

535
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,500
 I did some things that were wrong. I did some things that were bad, man.

536
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,200
 I feel so bad and so guilty. Oh, but I step into the new year, and you're telling me to let go.

537
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,400
 Oh, yeah. Happy. See you later."

538
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,500
 Are you with me?

539
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,300
 Like when we hear, "Let go of the past," it fills a great word for us

540
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,300
 because all the stuff that is bad in us, all the stuff that we suffered from,

541
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,600
 yeah, let's let those things go.

542
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,200
 That's not what God says here.

543
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,100
 He takes them back to the most amazing thing he's done,

544
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,700
 and he's saying, "Let go of that thing because that's only going to put you in a box.

545
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,200
 It's only going to create a way in which you're going to see the world that is not actually what I want."

546
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,600
 You see, God didn't want Israel's previous expectations of his actions in the world

547
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,500
 to be their ceiling but their floor.

548
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,700
 Are you with me, church?

549
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,700
 He didn't want it to be their ceiling, the thing that they're always hutting up against.

550
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,300
 "Oh, he did that in the past, so let's hope he does that again."

551
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,200
 And God's like, "I don't want to do that again.

552
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,500
 I did that before. It was important before.

553
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,900
 I've got a new thing. I'm doing a new thing.

554
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:33,400
 It's a kynos thing. Stop hoping for neos when I have kynos for you."

555
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,100
 Two days before Christmas, my iPhone brought up a photo history moment.

556
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,600
 Did you get those?

557
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,700
 Really annoying, right?

558
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,400
 You turn on your phone, and there's like a photo there from the past,

559
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,400
 and it's like when you had really bad hair.

560
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,700
 Five years ago, you had bad hair, you know, like something like that, right?

561
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:58,000
 So, two days before Christmas, my phone jumps up a photo of Christmas Day at the Vine 2018.

562
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,300
 And stupidly, I clicked on it.

563
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:07,100
 And I was taken to a folder of all the photos and videos I'd made on Christmas Day 2018.

564
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,500
 Let me tell you about that day.

565
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,600
 This place was packed.

566
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,500
 There was not an empty seat in the auditorium.

567
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,900
 I watched those videos with a sense of, "Man, God was awesome. That is so cool.

568
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:29,900
 Oh, I wish the Vine was still like that."

569
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,000
 It's funny, isn't it?

570
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,700
 How the great things God has done in our past can be the things that upset us in our present,

571
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:44,900
 can be the things that make us go, "Pfft, he doesn't do that anymore."

572
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,800
 I have to say, two days before Christmas, I was pretty deflated.

573
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,000
 Who's going to show up on Christmas Day?

574
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Like, so many people are on holiday.

575
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,500
 All my friends are in Niseko skiing. It's really annoying.

576
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,200
 Like, who's going to show up, right?

577
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,300
 At our 11.30 service on Christmas Day, we had almost 900 people in one service.

578
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,000
 It's the largest single service we've had in 27 years here at the Vine.

579
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,400
 We could not, like, we didn't just run out of chairs in this room.

580
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,800
 We ran out of places in the building for people to be.

581
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,700
 Out right here was full.

582
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,600
 The mini hall downstairs, full.

583
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,300
 Right outside by the thing, Tony Reed, our former senior pastor, was texting us saying,

584
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,100
 "Do not let any more people in the building."

585
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,300
 I love you, Tony, but I agree, man. It was so packed.

586
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
 The single biggest moment ever.

587
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,700
 And there's me two days before,

588
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,100
 looking at the great thing God has done in the past,

589
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,600
 and kind of going, "That's now my thing that I kind of..."

590
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,700
 And like, God is like, "You have no idea, Andrew, what I'm about to do."

591
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,100
 And of course, it's not about the numbers of things, the size of things.

592
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,400
 Some of the great new things that God wants to do in you are so small

593
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,700
 that you're likely to miss them unless He opens your eyes.

594
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,000
 And so He says here through Isaiah to Isaiah,

595
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 "Do you not perceive it?"

596
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,800
 Can you not see it?

597
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,700
 What we're going to do over the next six weeks is help you to see it.

598
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,800
 This series is called "Will You See?"

599
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,400
 And I believe that there is so much that God has for you ahead.

600
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,300
 And as we look at this here on the screen,

601
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,200
 I'll give you a breakdown of how we're going to go through this.

602
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,800
 We're going to go through chapters 40 to 66 in Isaiah.

603
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,700
 And each week, we're going to pull out a new thing that God says to them

604
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,600
 in that critical season of history when He turns their expectations.

605
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,400
 And He talks about lots of different new things in those chapters.

606
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,500
 And we're going to look at those each week here together

607
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,000
 to help you to get your mind around the new thing that God wants to do in your life.

608
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,900
 Here's the thing.

609
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900
 Let go.

610
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,200
 Let go of all the bad stuff, the hard stuff.

611
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,400
 If you've had a tough 2022, and many of us have,

612
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,600
 don't allow that to set your expectations for 2023.

613
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,200
 Let me also challenge you to even let go of the great stuff,

614
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,600
 the stuff that God did that was amazing.

615
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,700
 But don't allow that for you to put God in a box

616
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,000
 and think that God's always going to act like that

617
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,100
 when God has new amazing things that are abundantly beyond anything you could ever imagine.

618
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:16,600
 That's your 23, and that's why I'm exhilarated for you.

619
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,800
 Amen?

620
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,200
 We're going to respond by taking communion together.

621
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,400
 I wonder whether you just take a cup with me, and the band are going to come.

622
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,400
 And I'm going to invite you to stand with me, actually, as we do this.

623
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,100
 I think there's no better way to start the year

624
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,600
 and to respond to a message like this than to take a moment

625
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,800
 with a symbol of coming around Christ in his life, death, and resurrection.

626
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,600
 So I wonder whether you just peel back the first layer,

627
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:52,100
 take the little paper, I don't know what it is, cardboard thing, whatever, in your hand.

628
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,500
 It's not cardboard. It's edible. Don't worry.

629
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,100
 Don't eat it yet. Don't eat it yet.

630
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,500
 I wonder whether you just close your eyes as you're holding this.

631
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,700
 What you're holding in your hand is a symbol of the life of Christ, his body broken for you.

632
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:17,400
 And as you start 2023, this represents the incredible things that he has done for you in the past.

633
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,900
 When his body was broken on that cross, he had given his life for his disciples

634
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,500
 and for those in the first century.

635
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:32,000
 And he gave up his life, his body, after having done all these miracles,

636
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,900
 all this teaching, all this incredible stuff,

637
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:41,200
 so that they would come to know a resurrection that was unlike anything that they had expected.

638
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,100
 What you're holding in your hands this morning is a symbol of the greatest thing

639
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,700
 that Christ has ever done for you.

640
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,700
 It might be when you came to know him.

641
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,900
 It might be your baptism.

642
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,900
 It might be the person he's brought into your life, a spouse or a relationship.

643
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,500
 It might be that moment when you prayed for someone who was sick and they got well.

644
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,500
 It might be a miracle that he's done for you.

645
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,900
 And just like with the bread, our place with the bread is gratitude.

646
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,300
 Thank you, Lord, for your body broken for me.

647
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,700
 So today it is that great thing he's done for us in the past.

648
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,300
 I want you to bring that to mind for you.

649
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,900
 And as you bring it to mind for you, I want you to thank him for that incredible thing.

650
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,700
 Maybe it's a whole list of things.

651
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:34,900
 Maybe it's for your family, relationships in your life, whatever.

652
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:41,900
 And that great thing is to be now your floor, not your ceiling.

653
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:47,100
 That great thing is not to be a box that you've put God in.

654
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:56,700
 And as we take the bread together today, we do so with this idea of allowing ourselves not to dwell

655
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,100
 on the things that God has done in the past that are so great,

656
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,100
 but actually allow ourselves to be open to the new.

657
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,900
 I want to take the bread with me together.

658
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,700
 Then you want to peel back the next layer of your cup.

659
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:21,700
 And then we're going to just hold that for a moment again with our eyes closed before we take it.

660
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,100
 So once you've peeled it back, just close your eyes again.

661
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:32,500
 Christ is with us here in this moment, and it's such a precious gift.

662
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,700
 The blood of Jesus represents forgiveness of sin.

663
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,100
 What a gift it is for us at the beginning of this new year to take the cups

664
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,300
 in that place of remembering our brokenness and difficulties.

665
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,100
 And just as we've thought about the greatest things that God has done,

666
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:53,300
 I want you now to take a moment just to bring before Christ some of the things that you're not so proud of.

667
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,500
 Maybe the Holy Spirit is just speaking to you now.

668
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,300
 Maybe it's just some sins that you want to bring to Him and confess before Him.

669
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,700
 Maybe there's just something that's there that, yeah, you know that.

670
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,500
 Maybe it's just something you haven't done this year, a relationship that broke down,

671
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,100
 something that happened at work.

672
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:17,100
 Maybe it was your fault, maybe it wasn't, but it was really difficult for you and really hard.

673
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,700
 The blood of Jesus covers everything that we do that we're not proud of.

674
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,300
 Everything that has happened to us, whether we've caused it or it's just happened to us,

675
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,900
 that has been difficult and hard. The blood of Christ releases us from this.

676
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,500
 The glory of the cross and the resurrection is that blood paid the price for our sins

677
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,300
 so that we are not punished by God, but we receive new eternal life.

678
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:47,900
 So just as Isaiah says to his people, "Forget the former things, even the hard things."

679
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:53,300
 I don't want you as your pastor for you to carry any of that brokenness, any of that sin into the new year.

680
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,300
 And right here we have an opportunity just to confess it before Christ.

681
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,700
 The Bible says just to take a moment to do this.

682
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:06,100
 If there's anything that we have against one another, we ought to confess those things before we take the cup.

683
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:11,100
 So I want you just to take a moment just in your heart to bring anything before Him.

684
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:17,300
 Ask for His forgiveness and His grace. He loves you so much. He's not angry at you. He's not upset at you.

685
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:24,300
 He's so excited about your future. Just bring Him that now.

686
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:32,300
 And now let's take in the cup together in the forgiveness of Christ Jesus.

687
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:37,100
 I wonder whether you just open your hands with me as we're going to respond just in a moment in worship.

688
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:43,500
 But as your hands are open, the Holy Spirit just wants to come and continue to minister to you here at the start of the new year.

689
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,500
 You don't need to rush from this place. You don't need to rush from this moment.

690
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,500
 Just allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you now.

691
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:55,300
 He's got such great things ahead. The kynos for you, the brand new.

692
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:01,500
 And maybe your prayer as we worship now is just to say, "Lord, open my eyes. Open my eyes.

693
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,500
 Shift my expectations so that I can truly see what it is that you are doing."

694
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,500
 Let's worship together.
