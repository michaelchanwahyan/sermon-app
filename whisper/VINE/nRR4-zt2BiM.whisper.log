[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   One more.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   That was very convincing.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Well, hey, listen, I want to talk about the elephant in the room.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.040]   I cut my hair.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.040]   We've noticed.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.040]   Yeah, we've noticed.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.960]   And in this hair cutting adventure, I've heard some rumors.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.360]   So we're going to address the rumors today.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.720]   There have been some speculation as to why I cut my hair, and I want to make sure before
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.840]   I dive into God's word that I am up front with you and we clear the air.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.600]   So the first rumor is that it was a wig.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.880]   Y'all, listen, this was real hair.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.960]   It took me four to five years to grow it.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.840]   Okay, I've got pictures of the whole journey.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.000]   They were natural dreads.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   They were beautiful, but I did cut them.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.200]   So they were real, not a wig.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.840]   Second rumor, this one tickles me, was that I'm going through a midlife crisis.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.880]   Y'all, come on.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.760]   I'm younger than Allison, right?
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.160]   Like, come on.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.160]   I'm still like vibrant.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.720]   You know, I'm 34.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.640]   I've got so much left ahead of me.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.440]   So no, I did not cut my hair because I'm going through a midlife crisis, and my hair is real.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.960]   It has not been a wig, but maybe it's not a bad idea if I want to bring it back.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.440]   Okay, Emma says no.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.440]   Whatever.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.760]   Let me explain to you the reason I cut my hair, because it's, you know, just so you
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.840]   know, because I think once we know that, we can stop worrying about that and actually
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.080]   focus on God's word.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.600]   My wife and I had a daughter back in June this past year, little Remy, and I love being
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   a dad.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   This is my second kid.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600]   My first one is Elias, the perfect little boy.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.640]   And I have the perfect little girl, Remy.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:40.320]   And I am about 99,000% convinced that my daughter thought my dreads were her father.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   Let me explain this to you.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.800]   So I, you know, her being tiny and a baby, you know, I look over her and I see her, and
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.680]   every time I would see her, I would talk to her, and I would be animated, and I would
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.440]   smile, we'd be making eye contact.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.880]   And I realized at some point that actually I'm making eye contact with her, but she's
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.880]   looking a little higher.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.440]   And so I would like swing my dreads and just watch her eyes go there, and I'd like move
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   over here.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   And my dreads were quite long.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.000]   And I realized she loved my dreads.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.960]   She thought her father were these beautiful dreadlocks that I had.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.000]   And I refuse to let anything come between me and my daughter.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So I cut them.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And that's the story.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So they're gone.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   They're not coming back.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Remy now makes...
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.360]   Someone asked me this after the first service.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.880]   They're like, "But does she actually make eye contact with you?"
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.560]   Yes, she does.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.520]   She does make eye contact with me, and all is well again in the Armstrong household.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.800]   But all three of us, my son, my wife, and I are adjusting to now being a family of four.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.440]   Having a little girl has been fun.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.720]   My son, he's three years old, and he is learning, man.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.160]   He's never had a sibling before.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.920]   He's the oldest, so he's learning.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.960]   He's trying to figure out, "How do I engage?"
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.400]   He doesn't know, "How do I play with a tiny little baby?"
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   He goes to school.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.520]   He has all the energy in the world, and she's just like, "Man."
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.400]   So it's a bit of a journey for him.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.160]   And I realize that he's been watching me.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.880]   He's been watching me when I didn't realize he was watching me.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.640]   He's been learning from me.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.720]   He's been spying on me.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.280]   A few weeks ago, I walked into our living room, and Remy's in her space, and I see,
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.960]   but I hear Elias over her little Moses basket.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.400]   He's like, "How you doing, my little girl, girl?"
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   In a high-pitched voice, and he's got his nose next to her nose, and he's tickling her
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.080]   feet, and he's doing all my mannerisms.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.640]   And I'm like, "Yo, dude is stealing."
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.320]   First of all, "Girl, girl," that's what I say, okay?
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   Kayla, my wife, is girl because she's number one, the number one woman in my life, so she's
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.320]   my girl.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.240]   Remy is my second most important woman in my life, girl, girl, so she's my girl, girl.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.360]   Elias doesn't know this.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.600]   He's three years old, but he's referring to her as his girl, girl, and I'm just getting
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.960]   a little bit jealous and annoyed as a father.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.200]   Like, pray for me.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.000]   It's a whole thing.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.480]   But I'm realizing he's catching on to the things that we are doing, and I'm not trying
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.480]   to be an example.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.280]   He just happens to learn from me, and he's listening, and this is slightly problematic
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.760]   because he's in school now.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.760]   And so every so often, he takes the things that he hears from home to school, so I'm
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.160]   already a pretty holy man, but just know I am being even more holy.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.920]   When I stub my toe, I quote scripture just to make sure that Elias doesn't say anything
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.200]   inappropriate, and we get emails at small world.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.760]   But I am now properly recognizing the impact and the example that I am to my son.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.200]   You know, my wife and I are both pretty big examples for him.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.360]   He copies what we do.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.360]   He listens when we know he's listening.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.680]   He listens when we don't know he's listening, and he's repeating after us, and we're pretty
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.640]   much the biggest example in his life.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.760]   Now he, one day, will be the biggest example in Remy's life because he's the oldest, right?
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.400]   Are there any firstborns here?
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.760]   Anyone who's a firstborn and have siblings?
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.880]   No, no, only children.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.000]   Just firstborn with siblings, right?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.480]   So I'm the firstborn of three, right?
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.320]   My brother Jeremy is great but not as cool.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.760]   My sister Jasmine's great but nowhere as cool.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.120]   I'm the oldest, and I remember growing up, my mom, I can still hear it to this day.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.840]   My mom would be like, "Now be careful what you do because, you know, Jeremy is watching
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.840]   you.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.360]   He's looking up to you as an example."
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.040]   And actually, I didn't share this in the first story, but let me just tell you guys what
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.920]   kind of example I've been to my brother.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.800]   So I played baseball.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.160]   I'm five years older, just so you know.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   There's plenty of space.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.200]   I played baseball.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.640]   My brother played baseball after me.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   I started playing guitar self-taught.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.520]   Jeremy started playing guitar self-taught.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.840]   I ended up marrying a white woman.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.560]   My brother ends up marrying a white...
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.720]   Like he literally has copied every single thing.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.200]   I have been such an example, you guys.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   It's been a good time.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.600]   Jeremy, I love you if you ever watch this, for the record.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.040]   But yeah, so the way that he operates, my son will have to be an example at some point
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.840]   to his sister, Remy.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.720]   And examples are super helpful.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.960]   Having a guide, having someone who has gone ahead of you, who can give you a bit of a
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.880]   template, who you can look at when things are challenging is helpful because times do
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.440]   get challenging for us.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.800]   Things are tricky, and sometimes we don't know the answer.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.720]   And rather than trying to blaze the trail yourself and figure it out, we have templates
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.720]   in life.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   We have examples.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:20.440]   And as we sit in this second week of our forgiveness series, I want to pretty much premise everything
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:28.520]   on the idea that Jesus was perhaps the greatest example of what forgiveness looks like.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.480]   If we want to know what forgiveness looks like, perhaps the first step is to be like
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:40.520]   my son and to watch, to analyze, to examine the things that Jesus did to truly be able
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.320]   to understand what forgiveness really is.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.520]   It's not something that we've created in the 21st century.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.120]   We don't have to set up how to forgive.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.920]   Actually, we have a pretty good template of the most powerful example of forgiveness found
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.920]   in Christ.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.720]   Extreme and radical forgiveness is meant to serve as a template to the church on how we
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:12.280]   ought to forgive one another because forgiveness is a hard thing.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.560]   Forgiveness is not an easy thing.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.160]   I think sometimes we get the misconception that we should just like do it.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.840]   It's a pretty challenging thing, especially if we're going to forgive the way Jesus forgave.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.800]   No, we've got to be able to see him, hear him, examine his example to be able to draw
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.840]   strength and guidance on how to forgive.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.320]   Perhaps there's no better place to really set up the forgiveness of Jesus than with
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.440]   the idea of the gospel.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:49.360]   The gospel is this, that Christ offers forgiveness to all, to all people for all things.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.400]   He offers, he's put on the table the chance for forgiveness.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.640]   All who have sinned and have fallen short, who's not been enough, who've messed up, this
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.600]   forgiveness ends up being the fabric of our salvation.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.040]   It ends up paving the pathway for our reconciliation.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.960]   It ends up being the foundation of our redemption.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.200]   This is powerful forgiveness.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.560]   Based off of what I've heard from this community, we need powerful forgiveness when it still
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.320]   hurts and you still carry the hurt of the offense that was done to you.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.480]   You need powerful forgiveness when you still have to look the other person in the eye who's
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.160]   wronged you painfully or still live in that space.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.680]   You need powerful forgiveness when the words spoken over you still mark and direct you
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.680]   to today.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.520]   You need a powerful forgiveness, not some simple stuff.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.400]   You need the powerful stuff.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.840]   And luckily enough, we have the example of Jesus and the kind of forgiveness he gives
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.960]   us as a template of something to look at.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.920]   When your offense cuts deep, you have the powerful forgiveness of Jesus as your template.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:04.480]   So I think it's best that we examine the gospel and the tenets of it because it will provide
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.640]   us both a blueprint and a guide to give us strength in the kind of forgiveness that we're
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.200]   looking into.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.460]   So the scriptures are quite clear on what the gospel is, but I think for most Christians,
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.880]   we don't use the word gospel every day.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.440]   It's just not a conversation piece.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.000]   You don't use the word gospel when you're talking to your friends.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.600]   So probably for that reason, we don't properly understand all of what it means.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.680]   Just a way for us to understand the word gospel.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.160]   I'm not going to go into all the Greek around it, but the simple Greek translation of the
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.520]   word gospel is the phrase good news.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.160]   So rather than thinking of the gospel of Jesus and it just being kind of like church jargon,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.560]   think the good news of Jesus.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.240]   Something good has happened and we are in response to that good news.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.800]   When we say the gospel of Jesus sets you free, it's the good news that he offers that sets
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   you free.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.200]   Gospel is good news.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.040]   For the Christian, it's the gospel proclamation and the inauguration of the reality of the
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.720]   good news of Jesus.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.600]   And that good news is pretty clear.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:13.360]   It's that this because of Jesus, if we now will confess our sins, he is faithful and
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:19.760]   he is just to forgive us of all our sins and he will cleanse us from all our unrighteousness.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:26.840]   So gospel, the good news is that we can be forgiven, that we can stand forgiven and are
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.840]   new.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.280]   And I know a lot of this probably isn't going to be new information for you.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.240]   I'm not trying to teach you anything new today.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.640]   I'm hoping that as we examine the gospel, as we remember what it is that Christ has
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.520]   done for us and what it means to live in that gospel, that God will just shed light on it
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.520]   for us to properly understand what these terms are and what it means for us.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.440]   So we're going to examine it closely today.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.600]   We've been forgiven.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.300]   Our sins are not just canceled, but our debt is paid.
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.040]   The scales have been balanced.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.920]   God remains a God of love and of justice simultaneously.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.120]   And we have to understand the elements and the tenets of what this gospel means.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.480]   So in one column, you've got sin.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.760]   In the other column, we're going to talk about what exactly Jesus did for us, how he actually
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.760]   forgives us.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.480]   And then lastly, we're going to look at what does all that mean?
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.800]   What does that actually offer us?
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.480]   What are the benefits of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and what he forgives
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.640]   us from?
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.320]   So when we look at sin and we understand sin, sin ends up being one of the first major players
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.640]   in this concept of our existence.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.480]   And I think for lots of us, we don't fully understand what sin is.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.920]   Like we understand some of the fruit of sin.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.040]   We understand like the things you're not supposed to do, but like what is sin at its core?
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.920]   And I think we have to understand it if we're going to have any chance of doing what Paul
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.920]   tells us.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.380]   He says that you should flee from sin.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.600]   Not like inch away, not like go to like where's the line of what can I do and what I can't
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.520]   do, build my house here and say, "Oh, look, I'm still good."
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:04.080]   No, if you understand sin the way Paul understands sin, then you flee from it at all costs.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.760]   You run away from it.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.000]   You avoid it.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.960]   You want to remove it from your life.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.200]   So we're going to start with understanding what sin is.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.760]   Sin tempts us.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.120]   It entices us.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.040]   Then it traps you and it entangles you.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:25.200]   It's meant to separate you from God, introducing elements like shame and guilt.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.520]   And we've all fallen susceptible to this.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.480]   Scripture would say that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.320]   We are all guilty of this.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.680]   And when we break down what sin means, in our sin we end up doing this concept where
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.240]   instead of having God as the one in charge of our lives, instead of having God as the
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:51.320]   one who rules and reigns over all things, we have exchanged that and put ourselves on
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   top of it.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.040]   Any sin you can think of, it has been an exchange of God for you.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.540]   We've replaced God.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:04.360]   In the Garden of Eden, we've chosen for ourselves our definition of what good and what evil
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.480]   is versus God's definition.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.640]   And we still see that to this day.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.960]   We don't know what truth is anymore.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.200]   Everything is subjective.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.480]   Everything is your own truth.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.520]   Live what you think.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.680]   Live your own peace.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.600]   We've exchanged what God says is good and evil for our definition.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.840]   Secondly, we've exchanged the way for human flourishing.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.840]   God has a way.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.440]   He has set up a design so that all would flourish.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:36.160]   In sin, we have exchanged that method for our own methods, a me first method, a me and
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.040]   my clan doing whatever I can to help myself get ahead.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.320]   We end up exchanging his method.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.640]   It ends up hurting people.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.280]   It ends up hurting his creation.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.120]   It robs us, or at least it challenges our understanding of our morality.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.080]   It pushes us.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.960]   We exchange God's definitions.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.240]   We exchange his way.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.880]   So boiling down, sin is this.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.560]   It's replacing God with ourselves.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.120]   It's an easy way to think of sin.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.480]   Sin is replacing God with ourselves where we've decided that we know better, that our
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.060]   lives are too precious to leave into someone's hands, so we take charge.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.980]   We do it our way because, you know, this is me we're talking about.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.340]   This is me and my family and the things that I need.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.680]   We do whatever we can to make sure we get what we need.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.280]   The basic nature of that is what sin is.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.040]   We filled ourselves with the things that are opposed with God.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.600]   We've labeled somehow these subjective things as the ultimate good, and we find ourselves
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.000]   as a people striving after achievement and after earnings, and we've labeled that as
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.140]   like this is the indicator.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.560]   This is the metric of what a good life looks like.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.240]   If you can earn this much, if you can achieve this much, if you can live in this house,
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.960]   if you can have this car, if you can marry this person, you've achieved, but that is
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.160]   not God's definition of what a good life looks like.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.240]   In our sin, we've exchanged.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.480]   We've twisted and poisoned the good that is here, trying to preserve ourselves, trying
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.040]   to get ahead, and the thing that we're aiming for, the thing that we're trying to attain
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:15.200]   ends up trapping us, ends up ensnaring us, ends up entangling us, and we find ourselves
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.920]   not actually achieving those things or earning those things.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:24.680]   We find ourselves ultimately becoming slaves to those things where we work and live and
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.880]   breathe just to get ahead, just to make a certain milestone in a financial setting,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.560]   just to earn a certain amount, just to live in a certain place, just to be a certain like
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   that.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.840]   That is not the reason we are here.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.440]   Genesis would tell us that when God created us, he had a mandate for humanity.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.520]   He had a purpose in why we would exist.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.720]   Yes, we bring him glory, but he actually had a mission for us.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.500]   He created us, and he wanted us to have dominion over all creation.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:58.120]   He had a purpose for us to reflect his image, to live as his image bearers, his representatives
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.880]   on earth, and when we fall into sin, when we take our lives into our own hand, when
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:10.240]   we define what is good and what's evil for ourselves, we end up becoming a slave to ourselves,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.440]   to our desires.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:17.240]   We end up being controlled by creation, and what a tragedy.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.840]   What an absolute tragedy.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:24.640]   We end up morally and spiritually spiraling while living in the consequences of poor decisions,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:31.200]   dethroning God and replacing him with a lesser God who is subject to temptation and gives
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.160]   in.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.800]   Scripture would tell us that this is sin, and sin has a price.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.040]   Sin has a consequence.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.800]   There is a response.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.760]   The wages of sin is death, right?
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:55.020]   So when we sin, the consequence of that is death, and our world experiences this now.
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.720]   How much sin in the world causes death?
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.960]   Causes the decay of humanity.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.760]   Causes the decay of our love for our neighbor, even our love for ourselves, and it's not
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.920]   just a physical death that we are spiraling into.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.960]   There's also the eternal state that God has created us to be in starts to corrode, and
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:24.080]   we find ourselves in this cosmic battle between God and his goodness, and our sin and death.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.120]   This is sin.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.320]   This is sin, and its impact is so strong.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:38.080]   But God, in his goodness and in his love, steps in.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.720]   He interjects.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   He intercepts us as we are headed for disaster.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.600]   I normally speak pretty exaggerated and poetically in just all the things because I'm a musician,
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.600]   right?
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.840]   I want to clarify that what I'm about to say next is not something I came up with.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:02.160]   This is how scripture defined God intercepting our sin, okay?
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.520]   Scripture uses very poetic, very intense and weighty words so that we can get a picture,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.200]   a clear picture and understand exactly what he does.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:17.560]   It says that yet while we were still sinner and while we were still away from him, while
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.040]   we were still dead in our sin, God sent Christ for us.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.880]   So before we did anything right, before you thought, "Oh, maybe I could be a better person,"
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.200]   before you reconciled yourself and decided to overcome whatever the temptation is in
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.980]   your life, before you said, "Sorry," God has sent Jesus.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:44.000]   This is where the gospel, the good news of Jesus shines into our world that despite all
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.160]   being lost and all being broken, Christ has come.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:54.360]   And he's not just come to erase our sins, he's come to forgive you and to make you new.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.680]   This is what he's aiming for.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.780]   This is what his forgiveness is meant to look like.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.980]   If we confess our sins, he is faithful like we sung a minute ago.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:09.920]   He is faithful and he is just to forgive us of those sins and cleanse us of all unrighteousness.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.120]   There is no death.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.600]   There is no death that's too low.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:18.720]   There is nothing you can do that is so bad that Christ's blood cannot cover.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.080]   This is what his forgiveness looks like.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.700]   You remember when I said that Christ offers us a powerful forgiveness?
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.920]   This is what I'm talking about.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.440]   That is a powerful forgiveness.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.960]   Don't we wish we knew how to live in a way where we could forgive others like that?
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.400]   The scripture would tell us that God loves us, right?
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.200]   I think we know that.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.360]   God loves us.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.160]   His forgiveness is not a siloed act.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.520]   It's not just him responding to the fact that we made mistakes.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.480]   No, but it tells us that God's forgiveness is an intentional act of love.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.120]   John 3, 16, perhaps the most famous passage in scripture says what?
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:02.400]   For God so loved the world that he sent his son.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.160]   And through his son, we get the forgiveness of our sins.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:13.700]   In order to forgive us, God gives us Jesus.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.320]   This is what his love looks like.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.600]   He could have outsourced it.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.880]   In the scripture, you read about like Michael the archangel or Gabriel who visits.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.240]   He could have sent one of those guys.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.520]   No, he sends Jesus.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.160]   And just to clarify, Jesus, God, same, okay?
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.160]   Same thing.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.200]   Jesus is God in flesh.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.000]   So scripture in Isaiah 7, we call him Emmanuel, God with us, God incarnate.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.760]   So God doesn't just send some dude named Jesus.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.920]   God puts on flesh and blood and he comes still being divine, still being God, and he walks
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.480]   among broken people.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.160]   He comes and he lives with us and he understands us.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.080]   He walks our journey.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.160]   God sends Jesus.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.200]   He ultimately sends himself.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.800]   What does that mean?
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.120]   It means this, that God made a sacrifice.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.000]   It means that forgiveness isn't just something you do.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.800]   Forgiveness is a sacrifice you make.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   Right?
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   Because in Philippians 2, Paul writes it super beautifully.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.960]   We understand Paul's other epistles.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.440]   We know that he would tell us to imitate him while he imitates Christ.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.600]   The Christian life is, even call yourself a Christian, is Christ-like.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.080]   We're meant to imitate Christ.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.280]   But Paul is going to push this idea significantly further.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.840]   Don't just imitate Christ's actions.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:40.440]   He's going to pull us and tell us that there's something even bigger, probably a precursor
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.800]   to imitating Christ's action that we have to understand.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.680]   He would tell us that we need to imitate the same mindset as Christ.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.580]   We have to think like Christ.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.080]   We have to see things like Christ.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.720]   We have to take on his mindset, how he approached things.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.000]   He took on a mindset of deep humility.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.200]   Deep humility.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.600]   Christ-like forgiveness requires this Christ-like humility.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.200]   So I'm not, I'll just read to you what Philippians 2 says so that you get why I'm saying this.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.800]   Philippians 2, verses 8.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.880]   "Christ, who being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.280]   be used to his own advantage.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.680]   Rather instead, he made himself nothing."
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.680]   Big word there.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.160]   He made himself nothing.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.760]   "Taking on the very nature of a servant."
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.520]   I use the, I think the ES or the NIV on this.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.520]   I should use the ESV.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.960]   It says, "He made himself a slave."
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.120]   Talk about humility, right?
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.880]   "Taking on the very nature of a slave, being made in human likeness and being found in
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:50.400]   the appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death, even death
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.000]   on a cross."
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.520]   This is a wild kind of humility.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.480]   Who lives this way?
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:04.600]   Who steps into such a radical, like this is what God's Christ forgiveness looks like.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.160]   This is how he forgives us.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.560]   He is executed through a radical humility.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:19.760]   So you can't forgive others like Christ forgives without this posture of humility.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.040]   Forgiveness is not something you do to pat yourself on the back.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.240]   It's not something you do to show the world, "Look, I'm a bigger person.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.800]   Am I forgiven?"
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.880]   That's not what it's about.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:37.200]   Consider that forgiveness is rooted in this mindset and this framework and this posture
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.800]   of humility.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.480]   And this mark of humility is a bit of a scandal.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:49.840]   It's pretty challenging because I know there's quite a few of us, understandably so, who
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:59.840]   would feel that for the offenses done to us, our offenders deserve our anger.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:06.280]   They deserve our bitterness for what has been said to you, what has shaped your identity.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.600]   They deserve some frustration for how you've been treated, for how you've been hurt.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:16.080]   The fact that you're still carrying this wound still from a close family loved one, they
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.480]   deserve your anger, right?
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.640]   They deserve our frustration for the way they've said things and treated you and hurt you.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.040]   We feel that others deserve.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.840]   It's only just that they get what's coming to them.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.000]   This is the natural way of thinking, but let me flip it on its head because Scripture uses
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.480]   the word about deserving as well.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.320]   Christ would say that, the Bible would say that we were once children of wrath.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:51.040]   We were enemies of God deserving death.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.360]   We too deserve the thing.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.880]   We deserved death.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:07.200]   But while we were still sinners, before we said sorry, before we repented, forgiveness
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.320]   is offered.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   God sends himself to come and take the place of the things that you've done wrong, the
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.760]   consequences that you deserve, God sends himself to take that on.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.040]   While we were still sinners, before we get our act together, God substitutes.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   He exchanges.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.020]   Now remember, when we defined sin, we said that sin was this exchanging of who is God
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.960]   in your life from it being God to it being you.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.240]   And in Christ's forgiveness to us, there is another exchange.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.760]   It's an exchange of who is guilty.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.920]   Christ comes in and you are supposed to stand guilty for the things that you've done and
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:51.120]   his forgiveness offers an exchange where he stands in the place of our wrongdoings, our
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.800]   shortcomings, where we failed, where we've been on purpose and where we've just not been
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.820]   strong enough to do the right thing.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:07.000]   He takes our place, which leads us to our salvation, but it's done through the path
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.960]   of the cross and the blood of Jesus, which we say if you grew up in church, you've heard
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.480]   something about the power of the blood of Jesus, nothing like the blood of Jesus, which
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.480]   kind of doesn't make sense because the idea is that the blood is supposed to wash you
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.400]   clean, but if you put blood on something, it doesn't make it clean, it makes it more
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   dirty.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.560]   So I just don't want us to be living in a world where we hear Christian jargon, we sing
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.880]   about it, but we don't understand it.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   So I'm going to take a few minutes to help us understand a little bit more why do we
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.240]   say his blood makes us clean?
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.920]   How does his blood actually clean us?
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.920]   What does that even mean?
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.120]   Are you still tracking with me?
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.280]   We're all here?
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:47.720]   So in the Old Testament, for the price of sin, the consequence is death.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:55.440]   God sets up this, I don't know how you want to call it, a system, a sacrificial system
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:04.400]   where the place of our sin and the death that we had acquired would be passed on to something
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   else.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.240]   Something had to die in place of our sin.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.120]   So the whole sacrificial system exists.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:15.200]   You hear about people killing goats and sheep and pigeons or turtle doves or whatever it
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.200]   is.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.920]   They had all these animals that they had to kill, and the animals had to be clean.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.120]   They had to be pure, but you really can't tell the motives of a chicken, can you?
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.580]   That might be a little much.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.160]   So God sets up this system where they need to optically be pure.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:36.200]   That's why they said no animals with blemishes, only the clean ones, the ones that were normally
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.080]   young and innocent to some extent.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:44.960]   And these optical purity, when the animal was killed, that blood, that sacrifice would
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.680]   take the place of the death that was upon us for our sins.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.400]   So they had a whole system around this, right?
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.360]   And in that system, you had to offer up certain animals for certain sins, but not every animal
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.640]   could cover every sin.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:03.760]   Not every sin could be covered, and at best, what was covered was a temporary cover, because
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.240]   after all, it's a sheep for a human, and nowhere is that fair.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.600]   Nowhere is that just or balanced.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.800]   And so God sees this.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   God knows this.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   God understands this.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:19.480]   This is his temporary solution while in the meanwhile, he has his plan, and he sends himself.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.960]   He sends Jesus, and we all know that God dies for us, right?
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.040]   Jesus dies for our sins, and we're made clean, but I want to look at the controversy of the
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.560]   fact that Jesus actually lived for us to be saved, right?
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.400]   So it's not just that he needed to die, but in order for Jesus to be clean, it wasn't
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   about what he looks like.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.840]   It was about the fact that Jesus had to live a life of no sin.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.480]   So that's why you will hear people in the Christian tradition talk about how Jesus lived
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.560]   a sinless life.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.600]   If he doesn't live a sinless life, his death doesn't mean anything.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.200]   He had to be pure.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.320]   He had to be clean.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:00.400]   So Jesus's day in and day out, when Jesus was thirsty and hungry in the desert, being
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.160]   tempted by Satan, do you know why he was saying no?
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:08.440]   Yes, because he was God, but because he was remaining clean and pure so that when he would
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:16.600]   die and be a sacrifice for us, our sins, all humanity's sins could be covered.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:26.740]   In his forgiveness, Jesus's death covers us and frees us, but it's also in his forgiveness
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.380]   that he lives for us.
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:35.760]   This blameless life that we get from him gives the blood power.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.560]   It gives, and that's why we sing and we celebrate and when we take communion, we've got the
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.280]   little tiny cup with juice in it, right?
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.760]   It's because the blood of Jesus has done something for us.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:53.720]   He lived and he died so that we could properly be forgiven, so that you no longer have to
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.280]   be guilty for the sins that you commit.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.920]   That's the whole exchange here.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   He's stepping in.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.080]   He's taking the place.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.040]   He's exchanging, and I could go on forever around this, but instead I want to give us
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.040]   a chance to sit and think.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.920]   Normally here at the Vine, around, I don't know, the 30-minute mark after the service
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.600]   or the hour and 30-minute mark, we have a response song and lots of you get up and you
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.120]   sprint out for lunch.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.120]   I get it.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.120]   It makes sense.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.200]   We're going to, instead of doing that, we're going to sit in this.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   The sermon's not done.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.320]   We'll come back in a minute, but I want us to sit and we're going to put up some words
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.680]   and we're going to have a moment.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:36.360]   This moment is built around the hymn, "How Deep the Father's Love for Us," which portrays,
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:43.440]   I think, flawlessly what the exchange looks like.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:49.600]   For Jesus to hang in our place, for Jesus to take upon himself the wrath of God poured
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.240]   out in our place, for Jesus to be the one who stepped in.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.600]   I know you're going to be tempted to sing it because you know the melody, but you'll
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.120]   see there's no microphone here.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.320]   There's no singer here.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.640]   We're not singing right now.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:09.760]   I just want us to sit because I think sometimes when we sing, we sing and we don't think sometimes.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:15.520]   I think when we sit and we just read, there's a chance that this might hit you differently,
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.760]   even if you've been a Christian for 20 years.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:26.160]   There's a chance that you might see and remember and feel just what Jesus did for you.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.040]   So I'm going to hand it over to Jethro.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.040]   Don't sing.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   Take a minute and sit.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   [Music]

[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.040]   [Music]
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:30.040]   The cross is the most powerful expression of Christ's forgiveness for you and for me.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   It was a ridiculous display of humility, a commitment to love, and ridiculous obedience.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:49.040]   It was our sin, it was our debt that he pays with his life and with his blood.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:57.040]   Christ's unforgiveness is actually unfair, because it's unearned,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:11.040]   but it's this beautiful exchange where God himself would take upon him the consequences of the mistakes we've made.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   I mean, I'm preaching this sermon three times, but even as I think about it now,
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:24.040]   I don't know, there's just something about really sitting in the reality that God would do that.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:31.040]   Like, I think we know it, we do know it, but not enough do we sit in it.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   And I'm just thankful. I'm just really thankful.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:43.040]   Beyond what it does for me and all the things that might get after it, I'm just thankful that his love looks like that,
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   that his forgiveness is that powerful.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   When we consider the weight of our sin, the re-exchange that takes place here,
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   the God-sized mistakes that we've made, the God complex which we live within,
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:10.040]   when we consider just how deep our sin was and is, it gives us a great opportunity to see how much greater
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:20.040]   the forgiveness of God is to cancel the debt, to satisfy our debt.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   Then we understand what Christ did for us. Then we understand that his forgiveness isn't something that you earn.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.040]   You don't behave good enough and now you get forgiven.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   You don't come to church enough and now you're forgiven.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.040]   You don't not say bad words and now you're forgiven.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   No, it's not something you can earn. It's something he has given to you of his own accord.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:53.040]   It's a grace. And it's because of that that we can boast in no thing, no power, no wisdom, no gift, no nothing.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   Nothing we've done, but it's a free gift given to all of us.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:04.040]   It's a ridiculous thing God has done. That if we confess our sins, he would be faithful
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:09.040]   and he would be just to forgive us those sins, cleanse us of all unrighteousness.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.040]   The gospel is a proclamation of good news.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:19.040]   This is good news that Jesus is willing to forgive all people of all things.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.040]   And when we see that our sins are now forgiven, when we see the way in which he forgives us,
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:30.040]   the type of humility that he has to have, the kind of sacrifice he's willing to make,
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   we have to ask ourselves, what does it produce?
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.040]   We are forgiven. What does that actually mean?
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:41.040]   We understand sin, we understand his sacrifice, but what does it mean that we are forgiven?
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:47.040]   His forgiveness makes available to us a reconciled relationship
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:54.040]   and it reawakens our spirits and it reaffirms our identity into God's family.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   In short, Christ's forgiveness is our salvation.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.040]   When you hear people say, "Are you saved?" or "I was saved on this date,"
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   this is what we mean by saved. His forgiveness leads us to that salvation.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:13.040]   It is our salvation. In our sin, we lived as hostile towards God.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:19.040]   We lived as enemies towards God, but what Jesus's forgiveness does is that it brings you in.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:24.040]   He doesn't forgive you and say, "Now, never come back again. I've forgiven you. Now just leave."
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:29.040]   No, he forgives and he draws you into himself.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:35.040]   He makes a channel, a pathway available that you can commune and know the heart of God
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:41.040]   to where the most sovereign being, the creator of everything, will speak to you,
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.040]   will inspire you, will talk to you, will comfort you.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.040]   This is what his forgiveness does for us.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:55.040]   It's another exchange where...and before Christ's forgiveness,
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   if God would look upon us, he would see our sin.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   He would see where we've fallen short because of Christ's forgiveness.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:06.040]   And if we will accept that salvation, when God looks at you and exchange takes place,
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   there is an imparted...Christ puts his righteousness, his perfect, flawless living,
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:18.040]   his sinless, pure life, he puts all that he has actually done upon you
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:25.040]   so that when God looks at you, God's not angry. You know that?
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.040]   As Christians, the mistakes you've made, when God looks at you, he's not annoyed.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:34.040]   He's not like, "Oh, you did it again." But I think a lot of us feel that way.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.040]   It probably makes us hesitate to come close to God
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.040]   because we think he sees us for what we've done, but the freedom that is found
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:47.040]   in Christ's forgiveness is that he sees you based off of what Jesus has done.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.040]   That's powerful forgiveness.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.040]   His righteousness, Christ's righteousness has been imputed towards us.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:00.040]   Another gift that we get is this reawakening of our spirits.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.040]   Right? So God could have forgiven us and left us be.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   Okay, he draws us in and he now looks at us the way that Christ behaved.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:15.040]   But then he gives us a spirit. He gives us his spirit that acts as our counselor,
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.040]   as our comforter, as our companion.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.040]   It's the one that helps us understand scripture and the word of God.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:26.040]   He gives us this beautiful gift of himself.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   Like how many times do you forgive someone and say, "Also, I have a gift for you."
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.040]   This is not very common, right?
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.040]   This is how Christ's forgiveness looks like.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.040]   He draws you in and then he gives you stuff.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.040]   He gives you himself, his spirit.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:45.040]   Not just the breath that we see in Genesis where he breathed his spirit and we're alive.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:50.040]   Now he sends his spirit to forever dwell in us.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   And it says that with this spirit of God in us,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.040]   we would be able to do even more than Christ has done.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.040]   Oh, he lived perfect.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.040]   That's just wild, right? Like what a gift.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:07.040]   This is what he gives us in his forgiveness.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:12.040]   Our spirits are reawakened and we end up becoming people who live by the spirit.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:16.040]   Most of Paul's books would have some section in his epistles
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.040]   about living by the spirit, being new in the spirit.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:22.040]   And it's because of this idea that Jesus' forgiveness doesn't--
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.040]   I think a lot of us think it wipes the slate clean, right?
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:29.040]   It wipes the sins that we had here. It just wipes it.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.040]   I wish I had a whiteboard. I could show you it.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   He doesn't wipe it. He like throws the board away and he gives you a new one.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.040]   It's not about like cleaning it off.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.040]   It's Jesus gives you a new--this is why it says that in Galatians,
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.040]   "The old is gone, the new has come in Christ Jesus."
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.040]   He's not trying to clean off how bad your sins are.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:52.040]   He's giving you something new. He's giving you a new life, a new spirit,
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.040]   a newness that we can now live in the spirit.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.040]   We can now walk in the spirit.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:02.040]   We can set our hearts and our eyes on things of the spirit.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:07.040]   He's giving us a new slate. We are made new.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.040]   And the last thing he does, which I just think is absolutely wild, genuinely crazy,
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.040]   is this idea that he brings us into his family.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:20.040]   I just can't imagine a scenario where you forgive someone of a tremendous debt
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.040]   and then after you forgive them, you say, "Also, here's my will.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.040]   I'm writing your name on it."
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.040]   Like think about this stuff.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   Like this is the gospel that Jesus not only forgives you of his sin,
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:38.040]   but he brings you into his family.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:43.040]   He says, "You used to be sons and daughters of wrath and you deserve death,
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.040]   but now you are children of God."
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.040]   First John, where we get our anchor verse we've been reading like three times today,
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.040]   in the few verses or the few chapters that are there,
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:57.040]   John refers to us as children 13 times.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.040]   Like it's really clear that God wants you in the family.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   He doesn't want you thinking, "I have to earn this. My son doesn't earn my love.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   Remy will never have to earn my love because they're my children.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.040]   And if I can love my kids this way, how much more will God love you?"
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.040]   He brings you in.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.040]   Modern day forgiveness is you say you're sorry, maybe I'm a little angry, but whatever.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.040]   I don't have to see you again. We forgive and we forget.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.040]   That's not God's playbook.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.040]   This is not how we've been forgiven.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   The forgiveness offered to you is he forgives you and he brings you in
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:36.040]   and he floods you with gifts, with his spirit, with an awakening in your spirits
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.040]   where you can sense the things of the spirit.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   He puts you on the list. You are now a child of God.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.040]   You inherit the goodness and all that God has.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   The power of God resides in you.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   Like this is why we have to, the crux of the sermon,
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:54.040]   this is why we have to look at Christ's example of forgiveness
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:58.040]   because this is the only place that we see forgiveness that looks like this.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:02.040]   No other religion, no other culture, no other story
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   has a forgiveness that looks like this.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.040]   This is like not even heard of anywhere.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:12.040]   It's absolutely one of one.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.040]   This is how Christ forgives.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   He brings you into the family.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.040]   He doesn't treat you like family.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   Paul would say he grafts you in.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.040]   You become his children.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:28.040]   And this is why he would say you must be born again, born into the family of God.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.040]   This is, it's so important that we get it.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.040]   The family of God, you are in God's family.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.040]   Stop trying to earn it.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.040]   Don't think you can lose it.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   If you accept his forgiveness, if you will walk that path to salvation,
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.040]   if you will journey with him, he puts you in the family.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.040]   You don't have to beat yourself up all the time.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   You don't have to worry about your status.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   No, he loves you. He loves you.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.040]   He loves us.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.040]   I feel like this sermon, and I feel like you probably think the same thing as well,
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   could have been boiled down to like a three-minute idea
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   because it's just been the same thing over and over again about the gospel.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   But ultimately, what it's saying is that despite what you've done,
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.040]   despite what you're prone to do,
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   despite how big the mistakes you made
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   or how terrible the choices you chose to make,
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   despite how short you've come up,
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.040]   despite the frustrations that you might have caused,
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   God is armed, and I use that word on purpose,
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.040]   he is armed with forgiveness,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:41.040]   ready, quick to forgive, slow to anger.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.040]   This is our God.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.040]   This is the gospel.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.040]   This is why we call it good news, right?
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.040]   This is good news.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.040]   Not a clean slate, a new slate, fully new.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   And I tell you this gospel story because it is of the utmost importance,
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.040]   and we have to remember, we have to remember.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:05.040]   In our world, we're flooded with so much stuff, we forget.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.040]   We have to sit and remember what he's actually done for us,
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:16.040]   what it actually looks like, the fact that it cost him things.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   And forgiveness won't just be something that we muster up with our strength
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.040]   and we remember this.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:26.040]   If we can remember correctly, if we can remember what we've been forgiven from,
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.040]   perhaps it's going to impact the way that we forgive.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.040]   And I want to, before it comes out weird and you think I'm saying something else,
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.040]   I want to clarify, I'm not saying that, you know,
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.040]   if you just trust in Jesus, all of a sudden,
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.040]   the way you are hurt won't hurt no more.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.040]   I'm not just saying that if you just trust in Jesus,
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.040]   forgiveness becomes easy overnight.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:48.040]   That's actually nowhere in the 66 books of Scripture.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.040]   No, forgiveness is hard, and because it's hard,
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.040]   we need a strength that we don't find in ourselves.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.040]   I have, if you were here for Converse, I just chose a few.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:03.040]   We had a prayer station where you got a chance to write the things
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.040]   that you were dealing with when it came to forgiveness,
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.040]   some of the offenses, some of the hurt that you're living with.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.040]   Forgiveness isn't easy because we've had hurt in our lives.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   Someone wrote, "I forgive blank for betraying my trust and my love for you."
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   That causes deep hurt.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   You can't just will your way or Jesus coat that, right?
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.040]   Someone wrote, "Forgiving myself, even though I know I'm sinful,
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.040]   God has already forgiven me, and I need to quit the shame
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.040]   because I'm a new person."
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.040]   Someone else just wrote, "Forgiveness towards God."
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.040]   Someone wrote, "Forgiving themselves."
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   Two people wrote, "Forgiving themselves."
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.040]   Someone said, "Forgiving my ma and my pa."
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.040]   "I release forgiveness.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:52.040]   The things you did hurt, but I know you did your best."
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:56.040]   Forgiveness, when it's that close, is hard.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.040]   "Lord, help me let go of the way my in-laws treat me."
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:05.040]   I know most people make a joke about that, but that will impact your life, right?
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.040]   "My dad, my grandmother, my country, my old friends, my family."
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.040]   Guys, forgiveness isn't something that a sermon fixes.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.040]   It's something that Jesus helps us with.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   So, forgiveness is still going to be super hard after this.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:27.040]   So, I do want it to be debunked.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:34.040]   I want it to be clear that you don't have to have the strength to forgive on your own.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   That forgiveness isn't something that you just do,
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:42.040]   but that forgiveness is actually something that requires supernatural strength.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:48.040]   When we still carry the pains of our hurt, we need God's help to forgive.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:53.040]   When we still live with the scars of what's been done to us, we need God's help to forgive.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:59.040]   In order for us to come close to this "forgive your brother 70 times 7" concept,
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:03.040]   we need God's help.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.040]   And that's what the gospel shows us.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.040]   So, look, I have two points, super simple.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.040]   The goal of this sermon is to help you remember.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.040]   It's to create space for us to remember the gospel, what Jesus has done,
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.040]   and to see it real, real clear.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.040]   And so, the two things I want you to take with you,
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:26.040]   I want us to remember so that we know what forgiveness truly looks like, okay?
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:31.040]   Remember so that you know exactly what you were forgiven from,
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:37.040]   exactly who forgave you, and what that sacrifice cost them.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.040]   Remember so that you can know what forgiveness looks like.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:48.040]   The second thing is remember so that we know where to go for our strength,
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:57.040]   so that we don't go to other places thinking that this person or this thing is going to help me forgive.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:02.040]   There's no other forgiveness story out there like this.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:06.040]   Only in Jesus can you find this kind of forgiveness for yourself
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:13.040]   and find the strength to lean on him and that spirit in him that is now in you
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.040]   to forgive others of the things that they've done.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.040]   Forgiveness is important.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.040]   It's very important to all of our hearts.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:26.040]   And so, today, I want to create space for us not just to stand up and sing,
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.040]   so I'm going to again ask you not to stand up.
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.040]   You can sing if you want, but we're going to create space to sit for a minute
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.040]   and just think and just reflect because there's some of us here who,
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.040]   if we think about it, if we ask ourselves and we're honest,
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:48.040]   today is a chance for us to realize it's not about how hard we try to earn God's forgiveness.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   It requires God's help to forgive others.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:58.040]   There are some of us today who this is just a chance to slow down and stop striving.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.040]   There are some of us today who don't know Jesus,
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:08.040]   and this is a chance to come in closer and ask him to reveal himself to you,
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.040]   that this gospel, this good news, because it's not for all people.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   It's for those who will confess their sins.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:20.040]   There's a condition to believe in him, not believe in yourself.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:26.040]   So maybe you're here today and this is your first time hearing the gospel.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:31.040]   Maybe you're here today and you just need help.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   He is our ever-present help.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.040]   That's such a good phrase, like always present, always available,
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.040]   never taking a nap, never on vacation.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:43.040]   He's always present, ever-present help.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.040]   Maybe today's a chance for you to lean upon that ever-present help.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.040]   I don't know what kind of work he needs to do, but I'm going to get off stage.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.040]   The band's going to sing that song.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.040]   Don't get up. Don't rush out, guys.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.040]   We're not just going to wait.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.040]   Sit in this.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   Ask God, what is he saying?
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.040]   What is he revealing?
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.040]   What is he unearthing?
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.040]   What is he building in you?
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   Let him do a little bit of work in you today.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.040]   That's why we're here.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.620]   (gentle music)
