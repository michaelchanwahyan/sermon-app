1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
 Everyone says, "Amen, amen."

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:11,120
 Hey, can we thank our worship team?

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,120
 Welcome to the Vine.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,320
 If this is your relative first time with us, we're so glad you're here.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,420
 We know that we got a full overflow as well outside and people joining us online from

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,420
 around the world.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,420
 We're so glad you're here.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,280
 Isn't it wonderful to be in a crazy city like Hong Kong and just have a moment where we

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,160
 can go, "Ah, just me?

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,160
 Just me?

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,160
 No, thank you."

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,840
 Or we can just take the foot off the gas for a moment and just kind of go, "Thank you,

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
 Lord.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
 Thanks for being with us."

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,400
 I wonder if you've ever experienced the absolute blackness of the darkness of night.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,320
 I wonder if you've ever been in a situation where you've been in the complete darkness

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,080
 of an evening or a complete darkness of a night.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,320
 If you're anything like me and you grew up here in Hong Kong, then chances are you haven't.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,080
 Because we live in a city, don't we, that's 24/7?

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,440
 A city that is filled with the ambient neon light pollution that it is.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,200
 Whenever we go to bed at night, we may draw the curtains and turn off the lights in our

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,280
 house but it feels like there's this other big light glowing out there.

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,900
 And I grew up in this city and I've always had ambient light around me always and I've

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,240
 never really known the trueness of what darkness is like.

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,800
 I've just gotten used to sleeping with the glow of a city that is 24/7, that never sleeps.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,120
 But this all changed when my wife invited me to come and visit her and her family in

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,240
 their small little town in New Zealand.

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,120
 New Zealand that doesn't have any neon lights.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,440
 And I remember that first night I had gone to bed, I was exhausted, I had been traveling

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,120
 down and was tired and I got into bed and I had a little side lamp on and I was reading

31
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,440
 my book but I couldn't read for very long, I was super tired, put the book down.

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,520
 I turned the light out and I freaked out.

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,480
 Because for the first time, literally probably the first time in my life, I was finally in

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,480
 a place where there was no light pollution at all.

35
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,240
 And suddenly I was in darkness, like complete darkness.

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
 It was like, "Ahhhh!"

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,360
 Like I really didn't like it, it filled me with fear.

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,600
 There was actually no difference in that room as I'm lying in that bed between having my

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,760
 eyes open or my eyes closed.

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,360
 It was completely black either way.

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,040
 I remember lying there putting my hand in front of my face like this just to make sure

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:37,000
 I still had limbs on me because I could literally see my hand right in front of my face.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,680
 And I remember lying there thinking, "I'm glad I'm here visiting my beautiful wife and

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,720
 her family but I can't sleep in darkness."

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,240
 It's like I needed like some ambient light somewhere to kind of lull me into a place

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,720
 of being able to sleep.

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,200
 The darkness was total and the darkness was uncomfortable.

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,600
 I needed some light.

49
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,540
 As Paul continues this incredible letter to the church in Ephesus that we've been going

50
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,600
 through as a church over the last number of weeks, he comes to a section of it, chapters

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,720
 five and six, where he has some of the strongest things that he wants to say to his church

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,900
 community.

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,320
 Stuff that's actually going to be kind of difficult for them to hear.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,500
 Stuff that's going to shake up a few things amongst them.

55
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,560
 And stuff that's going to sober them in terms of how they think about church and life and

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,340
 community.

57
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,160
 And Paul's doing this off the back of what Pastor Tim shared with us last week about

58
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,920
 this idea of taking off the old self, which is being corrupted by a deceit and our deceitful

59
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,520
 desires and putting on the new self that is filled with freedom and love and the glory

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,680
 of God and holiness.

61
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,240
 And Paul's just taught them, "Look, I want you to take off the old stuff, put on the

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
 new stuff."

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,240
 And then from chapters five and six, he basically unpacks what it is that he wants them to take

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,520
 off and what it is that they can now put on.

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,720
 And the passage that we're looking at here this morning, I think is perhaps the hardest

66
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,960
 things that he has to say to his church.

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,240
 He's got some pretty tough stuff to say to them in these verses that we're looking at.

68
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,840
 But everything we've seen of Paul so far in this letter is important for us to remember.

69
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,120
 Paul has an incredible pastoral heart.

70
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,540
 I mean, he loves the people of his church so much.

71
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,840
 We've seen this throughout the letter, haven't we?

72
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,920
 He's just spent three chapters, chapters one to three, unpacking Christ and what Christ

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,000
 has done and the grace that Christ has done to pay the price for our sins and to bring

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 us into new life.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,960
 He said at the end of chapter three, prayed that beautiful prayer of love.

76
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,120
 "Oh, church, I wish that you would be strengthened from within you with the power of the Spirit,

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,240
 that you would know the height, depth, and width and the length of love, that love that

78
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,960
 surpasses understanding would be inside of you."

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,400
 He said, "I want you to know love."

80
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,520
 And then he started chapter four with, "Hey, I want you to now live a life that's worthy

81
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,040
 of all the things that we've just talked about in the first three chapters.

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,080
 And I want you as a church body, as a Christian community to find unity together in the faith

83
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,400
 and the knowledge of the Son of God."

84
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,840
 He's just poured all that out and now he's getting to the point where really the rubber

85
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,040
 hits the road and he's saying to the church, "But there's still this going on inside of

86
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,420
 you."

87
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,280
 Despite all the stuff that we've seen, there's still this, but his pastoral heart is like,

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,880
 "How do I explain this in a way that number one, sobers you and helps you to understand

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,400
 the sin that is still at work in you and leads you to deal with that, but equally inspire

90
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,040
 you, lift you up so that you're living better.

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,880
 You're desiring to live in a way that you're not currently living."

92
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,240
 He's like, "How do I do this, sober you, inspire you?"

93
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,800
 And so here's what he decides to do.

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:57,640
 He decides to dig into the rich history, biblical history of the metaphor of darkness and light

95
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,600
 in order to help his church to understand how they need to take off, but actually Christ

96
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,680
 has already done and placed upon them so much.

97
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,480
 And as I unpack this metaphor that Paul brings us of darkness and light with you today, here's

98
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,240
 my prayer.

99
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,280
 I feel in my spirit that many of us here, myself included, it doesn't make a difference

100
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,400
 whether our eyes are open or our eyes are closed, we're still seeing darkness.

101
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,760
 We're really struggling to see the future for ourselves.

102
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,280
 We're struggling perhaps to see the future for our city.

103
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,640
 We're struggling perhaps to see anything good at all.

104
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,400
 And when we look around the world, we see so much darkness and it's almost like there's

105
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,480
 a hand in front of us, but we cannot see it.

106
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,920
 Some of you right now are currently in a posture of blindness.

107
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,000
 And my prayer as we open up these passages today is that something would click for you,

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,760
 something would shift in your spirit and you would go from darkness to light.

109
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,960
 Let me read this to you from Ephesians chapter five, starting in verse three.

110
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,800
 Listen to these strong words of the Apostle Paul, but from a pastoral heart for his church.

111
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,080
 He says, "But among you, there must not even be a hint of sexual immorality or of any kind

112
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,560
 of impurity or of greed because these are improper for God's people.

113
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,720
 Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place,

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,600
 but rather thanksgiving.

115
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:37,920
 For of this you can be sure, no immoral, impure or greedy person, such a person as an idolater,

116
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,360
 has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

117
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,040
 So let no one deceive you with empty words.

118
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,920
 And because of such things, God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.

119
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,760
 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.

120
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,440
 So live as children of light, for the fruit of light consists in all goodness and justice

121
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,840
 and truth.

122
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,920
 And so find out what pleases the Lord.

123
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,720
 Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.

124
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,080
 For it is shameful to even mention what the disobedient do in secret, but everything exposed

125
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:24,200
 by the light becomes visible and everything illuminated becomes a light."

126
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,080
 This is why it says, "Wake up, O sleeper.

127
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,400
 Rise from the dead and Christ will shine on you."

128
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,680
 So be very careful then how you live.

129
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:41,720
 God is unwise, but is wise, making the most of every opportunity because the days are

130
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
 dark.

131
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
 They are evil.

132
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,960
 It's really majestic what Paul does here.

133
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,600
 He's not trying to win friends.

134
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,880
 He's trying to be really honest and direct with his community.

135
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,840
 And there's this beautiful flow in what he's teaching here.

136
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,960
 He starts out by addressing some of that deep stuff that he can see still at work with his

137
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,240
 people, but then he moves them to think about this metaphor of darkness and light.

138
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,760
 And in that, he calls them to now live in a new way, to live, and I love this phrase,

139
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,600
 as children of light.

140
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,760
 So he's got some strong things to say about the sin and their brokenness, but he's speaking

141
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,080
 to them as children and he's giving them a new perspective on how they can now live their

142
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
 lives.

143
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,800
 I want to take you through this flow and hopefully as we do so, something will speak into your

144
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,960
 soul here.

145
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,240
 Notice the sin list that he provides.

146
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,880
 It's not an exhaustive list, but I think he's chosen specific sins that were relevant for

147
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,960
 this particular community.

148
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,000
 Things like the sexual immorality, the greed, there's a whole bunch of them that I've highlighted

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,980
 on the screen there for you to see.

150
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,800
 What I want you to see most importantly is that Paul is talking about not just general

151
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
 things.

152
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
 Hey, don't do these things.

153
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,120
 He's saying these things are at work within you and I'm pointing them out for one very

154
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,520
 important reason.

155
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,600
 These particular sins that he's highlighting, that he sees at work in his body, these sins

156
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,080
 he's saying basically are sins that don't just break your relationship with your father,

157
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,920
 with God, but it also breaks your relationship with one another.

158
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,060
 Every single one of these is about breaking that community that he's just prayed for them

159
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,040
 at the end of chapter three that they would have, and he's just said at the beginning

160
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,960
 of chapter four that unity that they can find in the knowledge and the faith of God.

161
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,360
 These things he's saying breaks everything that we've been talking about in the letter

162
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,740
 so far.

163
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,800
 Every single one of these are basically selfish acts that you do at the expense of the other.

164
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,960
 The sexually immoral, those that are sexually in immorality, he says, what you're doing

165
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,040
 is you're seeking pleasure for yourself even at the expense of the people around you.

166
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
 He talks about greed.

167
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,760
 Greed, by its very definition, is the hoarding of resources so that you gain, again, at the

168
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,360
 expense of the other.

169
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,920
 He talks about harsh language, coarse joking.

170
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,720
 Again, it's all around this idea of we shouldn't be slandering each other, we shouldn't be

171
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,220
 gossiping about each other, we shouldn't be making fun of one another.

172
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,400
 That just breaks this unity, but God's called us to unity.

173
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,360
 Do you see this?

174
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,880
 And the reason why this is important is because he actually does something incredibly theological.

175
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,320
 Let me show you this from verse five.

176
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,640
 He says, "For this you can be sure, no immoral, impure, or greedy person, such a person as

177
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,240
 an idolater has an inheritance in the kingdom of God or the kingdom of Christ."

178
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,960
 It's really important you see something here.

179
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,800
 Paul says, look, when you're doing sins, that breaks the unity and community that you can

180
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,480
 have as the body, here's ultimately what you're doing.

181
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,060
 You're doing idolatry, and it's idolatry not worshipping other gods, it's idolatry making

182
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,360
 yourself God.

183
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,320
 Come on, church, this is super important that you track with this.

184
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,020
 Because what he's saying, something that's very deep here, this is the original sin that

185
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,800
 happened in the garden.

186
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,640
 If you go back to Genesis chapter three, and you see Adam and Eve there, and you see Satan

187
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,400
 coming in that form of the snake and speaking to Adam and Eve, he basically says this, Satan,

188
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,080
 he said, "God told you not to eat of this fruit.

189
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,600
 Well that's because God doesn't want you to become like him, but if you eat of that fruit,

190
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,880
 you'll become like him, knowing good and evil."

191
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,320
 And Adam and Eve take the fruit because they've decided, here's the temptation, they've decided

192
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,520
 they're not comfortable anymore being made in the image of God, Genesis one and two,

193
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,940
 they now want to be like God.

194
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,120
 They want to be equal to God.

195
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,320
 So at the heart of the very first sin is this desire to be a peer with God.

196
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:38,400
 And what Paul is saying is that the ultimate purpose of all sin is to exchange your identity

197
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,880
 from being a child of God to trying to be a peer with God.

198
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,040
 That's ultimately what all sin does.

199
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,360
 It's trying to shift you away from your right relationship with your Father in heaven and

200
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,680
 cause you to think that you can be on the same level.

201
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,880
 So when we place ourselves at the center of our world through whatever acts we might do

202
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,120
 in order to do that, we become greedy.

203
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,760
 We say, "My pleasure is more important than anyone else's."

204
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,200
 What Paul's saying is, you're idol-worshipping yourself, and that is the root of all sin,

205
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,080
 and when you do that, you're breaking the unity amongst yourselves.

206
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,740
 You're checking with this.

207
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,280
 This is why he uses the word in verse five, the word inheritance.

208
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,300
 He says, "If you live that way, if you act that way, you will lose the inheritance that

209
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,280
 you have in Christ Jesus.

210
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,680
 You have no inheritance."

211
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,560
 Now, it's a very interesting word he uses here.

212
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,540
 He uses this word on purpose because, notice it, if your original perspective and relationship

213
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,880
 and identity is a child, so you're here, you're a child of God, and if sin causes you to try

214
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,980
 to become a peer of God, what he's saying is, you no longer see yourself as his family.

215
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,440
 You never see yourself anymore as a son and daughter.

216
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,120
 You think you're equal with him.

217
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,960
 Well, you're going to lose your inheritance because inheritance is a family thing, isn't

218
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
 it?

219
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,920
 Inheritance happens when you're within a family, and he's saying, "Look, you've decided through

220
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,720
 your sin, through the way you're acting, to try to be a peer of God, so you're going to

221
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,400
 lose out on your inheritance," and Paul is crying out to his church, "Don't lose the

222
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,080
 inheritance that Christ has paid an incredible price for on the cross.

223
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:28,200
 Your salvation, your hope, your forgiveness, your mercy, your grace, your flourishing,

224
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,280
 your shalom, be made now into his image so that you can become the fullness of him,"

225
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,920
 as he's just said in chapter 4, the wholeness of the fullness of Christ.

226
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,440
 He's like, "You'll lose all of that if you think you're no longer part of God's family,

227
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:48,200
 but you want to try to be God himself," and he's like, "That is not the way to go."

228
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,960
 And as Paul's unpacking this, he's inviting his church to shift something within them,

229
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,760
 just to say, "I don't want to lose my identity as a child of God."

230
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:06,280
 That is the primary thing, because in that perspective of being a child, it is not me

231
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,120
 centered, it is other centered.

232
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,560
 Christ, first and foremost, I submit myself to him.

233
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,680
 And Paul said, "That's how we flourish.

234
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,040
 That's our inheritance in the kingdom of Christ."

235
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,120
 And as your pastor here, I want to pick up a little bit of Paul's pastoral heart for

236
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,520
 his community in Ephesus, and I want to say over you, I do not want you to lose the inheritance

237
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,720
 that you have in Christ.

238
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,120
 And so here's what I implore of you.

239
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,800
 Enjoy the role of repentance.

240
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,480
 When we think about repentance in the church, so often we make it such a heavy topic.

241
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,200
 We make it such a weighty thing.

242
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,360
 We make it such a, "Oh my gosh, I've got to confess and repent."

243
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,840
 And Paul's saying, "You should find joy, joy in coming before Christ and offering your

244
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,480
 life and saying there's some things inside of me that I'm not proud of, and I repent,

245
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,480
 I confess, I ask for your forgiveness because I'm tired of trying to be like you.

246
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,440
 I don't want to disqualify myself from the inheritance that comes in Christ.

247
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,360
 My repentance is my ticket to my inheritance."

248
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,040
 And as I repent and confess and bring it to you, I don't do so in a heaviness, I do so

249
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,720
 in a soberness.

250
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,240
 There's a sober reality to the brokenness in me.

251
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,600
 I bring that to you, but I do in the joy of knowing that you've already forgiven me on

252
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,720
 the cross and the joy to know that you're now going to fill me afresh with your spirit

253
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,360
 and your love, and that I'm going to become your child again, and the inheritance of your

254
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,200
 goodness is mine.

255
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,560
 So I want to encourage you.

256
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,520
 This message speaks to you at all today about some of the stuff that's involved in you.

257
00:16:50,520 --> 00:17:01,160
 May I invite you to the joy of repentance that brings you back into right relationship

258
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,520
 with Him.

259
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,760
 It is this movement of repentance and the shift of our identities that brings Paul to

260
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,920
 the part where he starts to talk about the metaphor of darkness and light.

261
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,200
 Paul is, of course, not the first person to speak about this metaphor.

262
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,880
 In fact, it's a biblical metaphor throughout the whole of redemptive history.

263
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,000
 The Bible, in fact, starts Genesis 1, verses 1 and 2 in a perspective of darkness and light.

264
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,520
 But we learn there that God created the world, the heavens and the earth, and it says that

265
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,040
 the world was formless and void and darkness covered its depths.

266
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
 So there is the starting point of darkness in Scripture.

267
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,240
 And then in verse 3, we have the first moment where God speaks, and the very first word

268
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,360
 God says is, "Let there be light."

269
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,400
 Four words, one command, and everything changes.

270
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,860
 And so in the first three verses of the Bible, you get the gospel.

271
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,720
 You get a world that is dark, separated, formless and void, and you got a God who decides to

272
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
 make a difference in it.

273
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,040
 A God who says, "I don't want you to remain in darkness.

274
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,000
 I don't want what I've created to be in darkness."

275
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,600
 And He says, "Let there be light."

276
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,840
 And then in the light of that creative moment, the rest of creation happens, all the way

277
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,280
 up to the culmination of us as human beings, created in His image, made in the light of

278
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,840
 Christ and God Himself.

279
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,200
 Which is really interesting because then in Genesis 3, Adam and Eve decide to go back

280
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,040
 into darkness.

281
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
 Note that.

282
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,320
 We decided to go back into darkness.

283
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,640
 In taking of that fruit that we've just been talking about, in becoming a peer with God

284
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,480
 or thinking that they can become a peer with God, shame comes on them.

285
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,920
 And what does darkness do?

286
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,960
 Sorry, what does sin do?

287
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,240
 Sin drives Adam and Eve back into darkness.

288
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,760
 They cover themselves.

289
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,320
 They retreat from the presence of God, the light of God's presence.

290
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,040
 As God walks in the coolness of the evening in the garden, they're so afraid of the light

291
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,080
 of His presence now that they now retreat and they go back into a place of darkness,

292
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,960
 covering their shame.

293
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,080
 And for the rest of the biblical narrative, the story is basically this.

294
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,960
 Can humanity ever know what it is to be in the presence of light again?

295
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,840
 Can we ever know what the light of God is for us?

296
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,320
 Can we ever have that relationship like Adam and Eve had before they fell in chapter 3?

297
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,240
 Can we know what Genesis 1 and 2?

298
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,200
 Can we find that place of shalom, the beautiful Jewish concept of what it is to know that

299
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:31,880
 everything is right as it should be, completeness, wholeness, perfection, our soul right before

300
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,200
 God again?

301
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,400
 Towards the end of the Old Testament narrative, the prophets begin to speak and to use this

302
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,600
 metaphor of darkness and light to basically begin to speak into Israel and say a time

303
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 is coming in the future where God will step in and this messianic hope begins to build

304
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,760
 towards the end of the Old Testament.

305
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,000
 The prophets begin to speak into this metaphor, perhaps most famously Isaiah.

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,840
 And I want you to have a look at some of the passages here that Isaiah begins to speak.

307
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,800
 The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.

308
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,640
 The Lord will turn the darkness into light before His people.

309
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,360
 In the future, the Lord will be your everlasting light and your days of sorrow will end.

310
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,080
 And Isaiah starts to point forward to this messianic hope that one would step in, one

311
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,000
 of God, not of us.

312
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,480
 One who would step in into the fullness of that and take what is dark right now, like

313
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,360
 in Genesis verses 1 and 2.

314
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,960
 Take that darkness and say, "Let there be light."

315
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,620
 And of course, for us Christians, as we consider who Christ is in the light of this, we understand

316
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,360
 Christ as the messianic fulfillment of that moment.

317
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,520
 And indeed, the whole of the New Testament picks up that idea and actually drives the

318
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,440
 metaphor forward even more.

319
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,880
 So the gospel writers speak of it.

320
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,240
 Look at how John speaks about it here.

321
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,760
 He shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.

322
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,640
 He is the true light that gives light to everyone.

323
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,280
 And then Jesus himself takes on this metaphor from Isaiah.

324
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,920
 Have a look at John 8, 12.

325
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,880
 I am the light of the world and whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have

326
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,840
 the light of life.

327
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,560
 I love this one over here from later on in John.

328
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,760
 You are going to have the light.

329
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
 This is Jesus speaking.

330
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,120
 You are going to have the light just a little while longer.

331
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,420
 While you have the light, walk while you have the light before darkness overtakes you.

332
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,200
 Believe in the light so that you may become children of light.

333
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,280
 Jesus has taught this to his disciples.

334
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,300
 Paul picks up on this idea of being children of light and he brings it into his church

335
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,600
 as well.

336
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,120
 And so all of this redemptive history of biblical understanding of darkness and light

337
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,000
 comes to its fulfillment in Christ.

338
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,320
 And then Paul takes that and he brings it into the very lives of his people.

339
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,520
 Notice how he does this in verse 8.

340
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
 I love this.

341
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,640
 He says, "For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord."

342
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,800
 I want you to see something really important in this verse.

343
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:01,000
 Paul does not say, "For you were once in darkness and you are now in the light of the Lord,"

344
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,200
 which I think is so often how we think of it when we hear this passage.

345
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,180
 And I think how we think about our Christian faith.

346
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:15,180
 As in, like, I'm just sort of like neutral and sometimes I find myself in darkness and

347
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,520
 sometimes I find myself in light.

348
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,000
 As Christians, we think we're neutral, but if life happens or if I drink a little bit

349
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,320
 too much or if I stumble onto that website, I'm in darkness for a while.

350
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,800
 But if I have a good week and I pray well and I try hard and I come to church regularly,

351
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,040
 I find myself in the light.

352
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:41,140
 And we think that we are neutral and it's just about the place that we're in in terms

353
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
 of our faith.

354
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,000
 Paul looks at that thinking and he says, "That's faulty thinking.

355
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,080
 You're not neutral," he's saying.

356
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,880
 And it's not about the place you're in.

357
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,200
 You need to understand you were darkness.

358
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,520
 The totality of darkness was who you were.

359
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,060
 It wasn't like you were neutral and you just happened to be surrounded by darkness.

360
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,840
 You were darkness itself, he says.

361
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,560
 Strong words.

362
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,740
 Because he's wanting you to understand what sin does.

363
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,800
 The wages of sin is what?

364
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,080
 Death.

365
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,040
 And he's spoken to his church, hasn't he, already in chapter two.

366
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,520
 And he says, "When you were in your sins, you were what?

367
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
 Asleep?"

368
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
 No, he didn't say that.

369
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,580
 He said, "When you were in your sins, you were dead, like literally dead."

370
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,400
 So he sees sin in that way.

371
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,860
 So you are not in sin, you were sin, he's saying.

372
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,360
 You were not in darkness, you were darkness.

373
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,880
 You were the separation, you were the death.

374
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,600
 And that's a sobering thing for him to teach his church.

375
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,160
 It's a hard thing for us to think because we like to remain neutral.

376
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,760
 We like to think that we're neutral people and it's just whether we're in one thing or

377
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,840
 in the other.

378
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
 And Paul says, "No, no, no.

379
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,120
 If you think sin is that way, you will never have a sober understanding of the power of

380
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
 sin."

381
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,880
 Come on, church.

382
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,960
 If you think that way, you will always think, "Well, if I just try a little bit harder or

383
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,360
 if I get a little bit more faithful or read a little bit more of my Bible, I'm going to

384
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
 be okay."

385
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,680
 And Paul's like, "Sin is death.

386
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
 Sin is darkness.

387
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,760
 And when we're in sin, we are actually darkness.

388
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,920
 We're not in it.

389
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,680
 We are the darkness."

390
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,960
 Now as sobering as that is, he then says, "But guess what?

391
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,520
 Now that you're in Christ, you are the light."

392
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,960
 In other words, it's not a temporary location for you and you're moving in and out.

393
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,760
 He's saying, "Now you are light.

394
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,240
 You are the light of the world."

395
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,880
 It's funny because Jesus calls himself the light of the world, but then later on he says

396
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,840
 to the disciples, "You're the light of the world."

397
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,120
 And this is what Paul's picking up on here.

398
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,000
 He's saying, "You were darkness.

399
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,560
 Now you are light," which is why he says this.

400
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,920
 He says, "Live as children of light."

401
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,400
 He says, "Live a life like this.

402
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,500
 Live with boldness and courage.

403
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,200
 Live with hope and faith.

404
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,560
 Live as if the light really is in you, that you are this light in the world."

405
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,200
 He's like, "I want you to live like that."

406
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,880
 And the question that the church in Ephesus should have asked and I think we need to ask

407
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,720
 is this, "How do I live as children of light in a world that continues to be so filled

408
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
 with darkness?"

409
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,080
 That's an important question for us at the Vine.

410
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,480
 How do we want to, how are we able to live as children of light in a world that is still

411
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:33,560
 so filled with darkness?

412
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,400
 Paul offers two answers to that question.

413
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,720
 It's found in verses 13 and 14.

414
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,160
 Let me read these verses.

415
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
 These are beautiful to me.

416
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,680
 You see, he says this, "But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, and everything

417
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,920
 illuminated becomes a light."

418
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
 I'm going to read that again.

419
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,320
 "But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, and everything illuminated becomes

420
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
 a light."

421
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,800
 He's like, "Do you want to know how it is that you're able to walk as a child of light?

422
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,120
 First of all, you have to understand that you could not do anything because you were

423
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,240
 darkness.

424
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,040
 God had to step in and do it, first of all, for you.

425
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,640
 Everything that is exposed by the light becomes visible."

426
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
 Light's this fascinating thing.

427
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,400
 If you look at it scientifically, essentially a definition of what light is, is it's electromagnetic

428
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,760
 radiation of a wavelength that is visible to the human eye.

429
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
 Write that down in your notes.

430
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,800
 That's very important.

431
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,020
 And here's the crazy thing.

432
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,020
 It is about 400 to 700 nanometers in size, very, very, very, very small.

433
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,920
 And it travels at one of the fastest things that can travel.

434
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,000
 It travels at 182, 868 miles per second.

435
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,740
 Not miles per hour, miles per second.

436
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,920
 So what light does is it goes out and it bounces off of the surface.

437
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
 Look around you right now.

438
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,900
 Okay, you can see the people in this room because there is some light in this room,

439
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,220
 and that electromagnetic radiation is bouncing off of the people around you, enabling you

440
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,260
 to see them.

441
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,700
 But here's the reality.

442
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:09,660
 We're blind or we're in darkness when actually that electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength

443
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,740
 is removed.

444
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,260
 When light is removed, we have no ability to bounce off of one another to actually look

445
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,500
 at each other and see.

446
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,680
 So Paul, when he's talking about those sins of sexual morality and greed and brokenness,

447
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,020
 what he's basically saying is, "You got all this stuff that's at work in you, and what

448
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,200
 that's causing you to do is become blind to one another.

449
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,820
 You can't see each other, nor can you see God because you're now in an environment where

450
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:40,380
 you are completely in the dark," he's saying, "because it has cut out all of the light,

451
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,780
 and you cannot see anymore."

452
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,420
 And this is a sobering thing.

453
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,940
 I want you to feel this.

454
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,900
 I know that there's still a little bit of ambient light in here.

455
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,900
 We can't make this place completely dark because of the exit signs and a whole bunch of other

456
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,900
 things.

457
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,480
 But I want you to kind of look around as well.

458
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,800
 We can't see each other as clearly anymore.

459
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,460
 And basically what Paul's teaching is, this is what sin does.

460
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,660
 It causes you to become blind.

461
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,400
 It's like you can't see your hand in front of your face, and there's nothing you can

462
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,360
 do to change that.

463
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,240
 But then, because God so loves the world, here's what he does.

464
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:24,720
 In Christ, he basically says this, "Let there be light, and there was light."

465
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,480
 So the light, yeah.

466
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
 I love this.

467
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
 I love this.

468
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,920
 Half of you were sitting there throughout the whole service going, "Why have they not

469
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,040
 fixed that horrible thing that's hanging in the middle of the room?"

470
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,280
 That's Jesus right there.

471
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
 But the light comes.

472
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
 God brings this light.

473
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,920
 Now, I want you to notice the room again.

474
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,440
 We can begin to see each other again.

475
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,600
 Not only that, but we can begin to see ourselves.

476
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:02,080
 See, Paul says everything is exposed by the light that makes everything visible.

477
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,180
 So Jesus makes everything visible.

478
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,600
 Everything inside of me that is broken and dark, the darkness, my darkness, the fact

479
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,800
 that I am darkness, I can only tell that when the light shines.

480
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
 Otherwise I'm ignorant.

481
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,880
 Otherwise I'm blind to it.

482
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,500
 I've got the hand in front of my face, and I can't see it.

483
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,300
 But Christ, as He comes with the light, it changes everything within me, and I can begin

484
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,500
 to go, "Hang on a sec.

485
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,620
 There is the brokenness.

486
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,740
 There is the darkness.

487
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,060
 There is the sin, and I need to somehow deal with that."

488
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,420
 The light, Paul says, makes everything visible.

489
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,500
 It exposes it, he says.

490
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,340
 But then he says something that is really key.

491
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,660
 He then says, "Not only does the light of Christ enable you to begin to see yourself

492
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,820
 as you should see yourself, and see one another as we should see one another," he then says,

493
00:29:53,820 --> 00:30:00,860
 and this is really important, "Everything that is illuminated becomes a light."

494
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,420
 He uses this wonderful word, this idea of something being illuminated.

495
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,380
 It's a beautiful phrase for salvation.

496
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,500
 It's one of the only times Paul uses it to speak of our salvation.

497
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,940
 He says, "Everything that becomes illuminated," in other words, everything that becomes illuminated

498
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:21,140
 by the light, he says, "It's not just," note this, "It's not just so that you can see the

499
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,260
 darkness finally and do something about it.

500
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,500
 It's not just so that you can kind of connect with one another."

501
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,060
 What he's also saying is, you've got to understand that there's something else also at play here,

502
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
 right?

503
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:37,100
 And what else is at play is that every one of us has the potential to become this kind

504
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,260
 of light that Christ has, and that light that Christ wants to give us.

505
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,740
 We have this potential sitting within us.

506
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,620
 But when we're in darkness, when we are the darkness, that potential is not there at all,

507
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,780
 and we're walking around like this.

508
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,300
 Are you with me?

509
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,300
 But Paul says, first of all, Jesus' light illuminates everything for us so that we can

510
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,100
 realize that there's nothing going on here.

511
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,900
 But then he says, "Everything, though, that is illuminated becomes a light."

512
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:11,260
 In other words, in our relationship with Christ, we then become the light.

513
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:17,060
 Just like Paul is saying, you've got to understand that Christ illuminates everything, but everything

514
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:26,420
 that becomes illuminated becomes a light.

515
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,460
 And because it's a light, it's not our light, remember?

516
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,260
 Our light, it would be like this, right?

517
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:40,260
 We have no light, but when we come into relationship with the light, we bring His light now.

518
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,580
 And Paul says, "You were once darkness, now you're light."

519
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,380
 So then he says, "Live as children of light."

520
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:53,060
 Like take the light into the darker places around you and begin to shine that light so

521
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:59,380
 that the darkness in people and the darkness around can be seen, not in a way of judging

522
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,380
 them.

523
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,500
 He uses this word, "exposed."

524
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,700
 I love this word, "exposed."

525
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,180
 It literally means to prove with evidence.

526
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,780
 Paul's saying, "Your job is not to go to the dark places."

527
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,860
 I'm going to go to the really dark places out here somewhere.

528
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,860
 These guys are very...

529
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,860
 I'm coming here.

530
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:22,620
 "Your job is not to go to the really dark places and start bashing people with the light.

531
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,780
 Start like kind of slandering them and, 'Oh, you guys are terrible.

532
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,780
 Can't you see how you're living your life?

533
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,180
 Oh, you guys suck.'"

534
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,900
 He's saying, "Prove with evidence that your light shines."

535
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
 What does that mean?

536
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
 Well, he actually defines it.

537
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:44,260
 He says, "For the fruit of those who are light is goodness, justice, and truth."

538
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,780
 The things that we do and the ways that we live reflects the light of Christ that is

539
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,780
 within us.

540
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,540
 We don't have to go wagging our fingers.

541
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,860
 We just go, "Check this out.

542
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,260
 Wouldn't you want to be a part of this?

543
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,740
 Wouldn't you want that dead thing that's in you to be alive again?

544
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,340
 Like if it got dead, wouldn't you want to make it...

545
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,780
 Oh, darn it.

546
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,700
 So but wouldn't you want to make it alive again, right?"

547
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,220
 And he's like, "That's the invitation in this passage."

548
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,020
 Paul is not saying, "Hey, wag your finger in judgment."

549
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,860
 He's saying, "Invite people to redemption.

550
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,740
 Live your light like that."

551
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,740
 I love this.

552
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,460
 Jesus says it this way in Matthew.

553
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,980
 I love this passage from Christ.

554
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
 He says it this way.

555
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,460
 "May your light shine before all people that they may see your good deeds and praise your

556
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,460
 Father in heaven."

557
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,500
 Not praise you.

558
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
 Praise your Father in heaven.

559
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,860
 They will see your good deeds.

560
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,460
 I think church history has shown us this beautifully.

561
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:50,100
 I think of people like John and Charles Wesley who took the light of Christ that was within

562
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:57,420
 them to the darkness of London in the mid-1700s and brought revival to that land.

563
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,700
 I think of William Wilberforce and the Clapham sect in the late 1700s who took the light

564
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,760
 of Christ that was within them and brought it to the darkness of slavery and over a 25-year-long

565
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,060
 journey and battle was able to see that abolished in the British Empire.

566
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:18,100
 I think of Amy Carmichael who took the light that God had given her in the early 1900s

567
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,420
 and traveled to India, to the north of India, and actually stood against the darkness of

568
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:28,260
 child exploitation and child abuse in the Hindu temples of that time.

569
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,620
 I think of Martin Luther King Jr. in the '60s, more close perhaps to us, who saw the darkness

570
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:39,300
 of injustice and racism and decided to make a difference about it and brought the light

571
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,900
 that was in him to bear on a whole nation.

572
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,700
 And Paul is writing this and he's saying, "I want you to live as children of light because

573
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,960
 you're not darkness.

574
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,140
 You are light, but there is still darkness and I want you to go in the goodness and in

575
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,140
 that justice and in that truth that is placed inside of you because of the light and shine

576
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,660
 that light brightly."

577
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,860
 This is why he says this beautiful thing right here.

578
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,380
 He says this beautiful thing here.

579
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,080
 He says, "This is why it says, 'Wake up, O sleeper.

580
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,820
 Rise from the dead and Christ will shine on you.'"

581
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,580
 This is like Paul, by the way, this is not a quote from Scripture.

582
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,780
 This is not Paul kind of basically saying something like, "Oh, by the way, it says in

583
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,180
 Jeremiah this."

584
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,940
 Actually, scholars think what he's doing here is quoting from an early Christian hymn that

585
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,420
 was active in the church at the time.

586
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,220
 So this is like him quoting a worship song.

587
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,460
 And he stands before the church and he goes, "Don't you know that we sing this?

588
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,940
 Don't you know that we say this to each other?

589
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
 Wake up, O sleeper."

590
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,980
 That's exactly what he's saying.

591
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,500
 He's saying, "You've got the light of Christ in you.

592
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,380
 Live as a child of the light.

593
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
 Wake up."

594
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,140
 He's saying, "Wake up, church.

595
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,100
 How can you live like you are living right now in all that brokenness that dims your

596
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,940
 light and causes separation?

597
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,920
 No, deal with your sin.

598
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,540
 Come into repentance.

599
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,540
 Receive the light that you truly are in Him and then live in that light."

600
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,980
 It's like Paul is kind of saying, "Where are those who are willing to stand up for goodness,

601
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,660
 justice and truth?

602
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,420
 May your good deeds shine before all people and may they come to know Him."

603
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,540
 And I stand before us today and I think about this so often.

604
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,340
 I'm like, "Where are the Amy Carmichael's of our time?

605
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,180
 Where's the Martin Luther King Jr.?

606
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,140
 Where's the John and Charles Wesley?"

607
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,000
 Where is it within the church in Hong Kong?

608
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,980
 Where is it within us?

609
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,980
 In our little bit, maybe we're not gonna change the world or change society, but maybe there's

610
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,420
 a relationship that's broken in our workplace.

611
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,780
 Maybe there's someone that we know who needs forgiveness.

612
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,060
 Maybe there's someone who's desperately lonely and we can befriend them.

613
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,340
 I don't know how it might look for you, but you've got the light, so live as a child of

614
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,340
 light.

615
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,680
 Wake up.

616
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,340
 Take a hold of what it is that Christ has placed inside of you, goodness and justice

617
00:36:53,340 --> 00:37:00,220
 and truth, and be that in whatever darkness He has placed you in.

618
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:13,580
 And when we do this, we come to see light like we've never seen it before.

619
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,540
 May you let your light shine.

620
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,060
 May you do it proudly with courage and boldness.

621
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,060
 May we see the darkness around us become light.

622
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,060
 Amen?

623
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:40,300
 I wonder if you could stand with me, and I would love to pray for you.

624
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,060
 And I wonder whether you just, as you quieten your eyes, quieten your eyes, that's a bit

625
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
 weird.

626
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,980
 As you close your eyes, quieten your heart.

627
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:53,380
 I know we're running a bit long, but I just wanna...

628
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:59,100
 There's so many of us who have been called to shine our light, and it's not always an

629
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
 easy thing to do.

630
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:08,620
 I wanna just invite you just to quieten your heart now.

631
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:18,300
 For some of you in this room, what is really important for you today is repentance.

632
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,980
 And like I've said in the message, this is not something you have to fear.

633
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,300
 It doesn't have to be heavy.

634
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,620
 But that recognition, I'm trying to become a peer of yours, even though maybe I've never

635
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,180
 said it that way, but I'm actually really self-centered.

636
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,340
 Actually, everything is kind of about me.

637
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:45,200
 And I think the Lord wants to break self-centeredness out of us as a community.

638
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,160
 And that will require repentance.

639
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,180
 But it's the joy of that, knowing that our relationship is then shifted from that peer

640
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,380
 of God to a child of God again.

641
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:03,680
 And I think for some of you here, that's a really important response for you, to respond

642
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:11,180
 in that openness of what it is to bring your confession and repentance to Him.

643
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,160
 Some of you just need to say, "I don't wanna be your peer.

644
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,220
 I don't want the universe to revolve around me.

645
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:22,060
 I don't want my self-centeredness to be the main thing in my life.

646
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,860
 I want you to be the main thing in my life.

647
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
 I need to repent."

648
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,340
 And I can see that that's manifesting in the way I treat others.

649
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,340
 It's manifesting in my sexual immorality.

650
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,600
 It's manifesting in my greed.

651
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,820
 It's manifesting in my coarse language and my joking and my gossiping and slandering

652
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,820
 or whatever it is.

653
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,820
 But Lord, I recognize it's manifesting itself in these ways that are actually bringing division

654
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,820
 and not unity.

655
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,220
 Lord, that's not what I want.

656
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,020
 I'm a child of light.

657
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,980
 So I wanna just encourage some of you now, that's the work Christ is inviting you into.

658
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,660
 But for maybe many of us, it's this work of recognizing that our light has been hidden

659
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,660
 for a while.

660
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:07,140
 And that God is saying, "Shine your light before all people so that they would see your

661
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:14,940
 good deeds, not see how cool you are, not see how gifted or talented you are.

662
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,860
 They would see your heart, the goodness and the justice and the truth that sits within

663
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,860
 you, the fruits of light.

664
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,740
 They would see those things and they would change because they would see."

665
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:30,300
 Remember, everything that is light exposes and makes things visible.

666
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:39,300
 And so I wanna just pray an anointing over you here this morning to be able to shine

667
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:45,740
 the light of Jesus without any sense of doubt, without any sense of apology, without any

668
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,700
 sense of being ashamed.

669
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,580
 For Paul says, "I am unashamed of the gospel."

670
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:57,820
 But to do so in love, to do so in grace, to do so seeking the good of others, to do so

671
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:03,740
 by laying your life down and picking up your cross, doing so by putting others before yourself,

672
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,860
 doing so by revealing goodness and justice and truth.

673
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,860
 And so Lord, I pray you would release your people in this.

674
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,900
 And Father, we thank you so much for this.

675
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,900
 And we're gonna just take a moment to respond in worship because I think it's really important

676
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,900
 that you take this time.

677
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,260
 If you need to repent, you take the time to repent.

678
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,460
 If you need to ask God to strengthen your hands like we talked about earlier, pray that.

679
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:33,100
 If you want your light to shine more, ask him to show you how you can do that in your

680
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,100
 sphere of influence.

681
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,540
 In every single part of it, let's bring it to him now in worship.

682
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,540
 Amen.

683
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:38,540
 Amen.

684
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,540
 Amen.

685
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:50,540
 Amen.

686
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,120
 (gentle music)

687
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
