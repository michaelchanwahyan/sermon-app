7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,140
 That means the world to us. We're so glad that you are. Church in this day and age

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,000
 is a hybrid mix of people in a room and people gathered online. So welcome.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,800
 Man, I'm excited. I'm sorry, I'm just gonna put it right up front. I'm excited.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,680
 You guys excited? I'm excited because we're gonna open the Word of God

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,240
 together. Yeah. We're gonna open the Word of God together and dive into Scripture.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,040
 How does that sound? I have a longing inside of me. It's a longing that

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:08,120
 has been in me for many, many years. This longing was placed inside of me the

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,880
 first, very first time I got to preach. I was 19 years old and I was invited to

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,100
 preach and I was terrible. But I had this longing inside of me. And ever since I

16
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,560
 become a pastor, I've been a pastor now 12 years and been in church leadership for

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,320
 over 20 years, this longing has never gone away. It's the longing for

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:35,520
 breakthrough. I desperately pray for and desire breakthrough. I want breakthrough

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,400
 in my own personal life. I know the areas intimately where I am broken. I'm very

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:50,680
 conscious in my own life of the places where sin so easily entangles. I know

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,720
 what is dry in me. And just like that song that we're singing, I long

22
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,280
 for the dry bones to be made into an army. I long for us to understand what

23
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,360
 breakthrough truly feels like. I want it for you as well. And every time I

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,880
 prepare a message, every time I come before you, whether it's on a Sunday or

25
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,380
 some other capacity, I want you to know and to feel your breakthrough. If I was

26
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,360
 to use a biblical phrase for it, I would say resurrection. I have a resurrection

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,080
 passion in me. I want to know personally the resurrection power of Christ in me.

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,080
 Paul writes about that power. I read about it in Scripture, but I want to

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,280
 encounter it. I want to know what it is to go to the dead places of sin in my

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,400
 life, to the insecurities and the pride that I carry and feel a resurrection, a

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,560
 transformation, a change in those things. That's my passion. That's why I get up

32
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,960
 here every Sunday and do what I do. Resurrection life for me and for you. And

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,680
 at the beginning of this year, I remember the sense in me that I was deeply

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,440
 frustrated because I've been praying for this breakthrough for me personally for

35
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,240
 many years, and I've yet to truly see it take place. And I've yet to see the

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,680
 resurrection power in me that I truly desire. And at the beginning of this year,

37
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,040
 at the beginning of 2021, I was frustrated with God. And when I'm

38
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,320
 frustrated with God, I like to go on a long walk with God. And so I decided to

39
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:26,200
 do this hike, and I call it my stomping hike. I walk really loud and fast, and I

40
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,920
 use this time to tell God all the things that he's terrible at as a deity, the

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,280
 things that he's doing really bad in my life, and the frustrations and anger I

42
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,680
 have, why I don't feel like I've got this resurrection like I want it. I want God

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,840
 to wave his magic wand and set me free. And I remember as I'm pounding on this

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,800
 walk, and I'm trying to tell God, "You need to prove once again, God, that you love

45
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,120
 me." You know, those kind of prayers. Maybe I'm the only... Am I the only person who

46
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,800
 prays prayers like this? Yes. This person sitting over there, like, "That guy's not

47
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:06,120
 Christian." So I'm on this walk, and I'm praying this frustration and anger at

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,280
 God. And here's what God says. Let me read this to you. He says this to me. He goes,

49
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,200
 "Andrew, you long for all this breakthrough and resurrection in your

50
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,160
 life, but you have conveniently avoided the simplest truth of all. You can't have

51
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,480
 resurrection without first experiencing death. For there to be an empty tomb, there

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,760
 must first of all be a bloody cross." Not the words of inspiration I was hoping

53
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,920
 for. I'm gonna be honest with you. Not kind of what I wanted to hear from God.

54
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,560
 I mean, I wanted to hear the opposite. I wanted to hear, "Oh, I'm here to bless you,

55
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,000
 Andrew. Oh, I'm here to give you things. Oh, I'm here to change your life, Andrew.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,400
 Oh, I'm here to do all these things by my grace in your life. I'm here to wave my

57
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,280
 magic wand and all that pride in you. I'm gonna immediately remove it." I wanted God

58
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,160
 to do the miracle. God wanted to do the process in my life. Are you with me? I

59
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:04,520
 wanted the glory of resurrection without the pain of death. And I realized in this

60
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,040
 moment that I've Petered Jesus. Anyone else ever Petered Jesus? You know that

61
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,200
 moment in Matthew 16 where Peter does this amazing thing? He says, "You are

62
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,920
 the Messiah, the Christ." And Jesus responds and he says, "Wow, you've got it

63
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,520
 right. Yes, I am." And then he immediately begins to teach the disciples that he

64
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,440
 has to go to the cross and die and suffer. And Peter had the right title but

65
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,840
 the wrong idea. And so Peter says to him, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on a sec. You're the Messiah.

66
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,440
 You don't need to suffer. You don't need to die." And then Jesus says those

67
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,680
 beautiful, powerful words, probably the most powerful words in the whole of the

68
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,120
 New Testament, "Get behind me, Satan." This walk was my "get behind me, Satan" moment.

69
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,560
 I Petered Jesus. I'm like, "Jesus, I want all the breakthrough in my life but I

70
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,760
 want you to do it with your little magic wand of your miracle. And I'm not willing

71
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,000
 to submit myself to the things that need to die in me in order for me to be

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,240
 raised again into life. I want the glory without any of the struggle and the

73
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,480
 death." It reminded me as I was walking of Mark chapter 10 where there's two

74
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,600
 disciples, James and John. They come to Jesus and they say, "When you die and we

75
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,520
 get into glory, can we sit on your right hand and your left hand in the places of

76
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:30,160
 power and authority?" You know how Jesus responds? He says, "Are you able to drink

77
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,140
 the cup that I'm gonna have to drink?" He basically says to the disciples, "If

78
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,720
 you want to have places of power and glory and authority and breakthrough,

79
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,400
 you're going to have to drink the same cup that I am about to drink. Are you

80
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,760
 willing to do that?" And as I'm walking on this walk and I'm telling God off and

81
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,280
 I'm desiring for all this breakthrough, essentially what God does is He shows up

82
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,940
 and says, "Do you want breakthrough, Andrew? If you want breakthrough, deny yourself,

83
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:12,880
 pick up your cross and follow me." As Paul continues his incredible letter to the

84
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,360
 church in Philippi, as he's unpacking this beautiful fresh new vision of an

85
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,940
 alternative society, what church could look like if it was living publicly in

86
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,320
 the world around it, showing something of the nature and the mercy and the glory

87
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,040
 of Jesus. As Paul is unpacking this, he finally gets to the point in his letter

88
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,800
 where he begins to talk about the topic that excites him the most, but is not the

89
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,600
 easiest to hear. He's already talked to them that this new society is gonna

90
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,000
 look like a new way to pray. He's already talked to them it's gonna look like a

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,360
 new way to lead. He's told them that it's gonna look like a new way to find unity

92
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,680
 amongst each other. He's been straight with them that it's gonna require a new

93
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,480
 kind of holiness, and now he gets to the point where he mentions a thing that

94
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,240
 undergirds all of those things. He says it's also going to take a new way to die.

95
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:10,800
 And at the beginning of chapter 2, Paul unpacks this idea with an incredible

96
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,360
 poem. It's also known as a hymn. It's one of perhaps most famous bits of Paul's

97
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,640
 writing in all of his letters. It's a glorious just six or so verses where

98
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:29,240
 Paul explains to them what Christ has done in his life and his death and his

99
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,600
 resurrection. And in this poem, Paul is hoping to inspire them into a pattern

100
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,080
 for themselves of death and resurrection. And if you're in here today or watching

101
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,040
 online and you're like, "I'm desiring breakthrough for me," can I introduce you

102
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,080
 to a new way to die? I'm gonna read this to us out of Philippians chapter 2, and

103
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,840
 as we do so, I want you to close your eyes, whether you're online or in this

104
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,120
 room. Would you close your eyes with me? And I want to read these words to you,

105
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,920
 and I want you just to soak on the beauty and profundity of what Paul is

106
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,160
 saying about Jesus. This is Philippians 2, starting in verse 5. "Your attitude

107
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,000
 should be the same as that of Christ Jesus, who being in the very nature of

108
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,080
 God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself

109
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,920
 nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness, and

110
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,160
 being found in the appearance as man, he humbled himself and became obedient to

111
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:44,440
 death, yes, even death on a cross. Therefore God exalted him to the highest

112
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,640
 place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of

113
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,960
 Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and even under the earth,

114
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:01,400
 and every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God

115
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,960
 the Father." Father, as we open up this incredible poem of Paul's, as we sit

116
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,560
 today on this reality of what Jesus has done, Lord I want to pray that you would

117
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,920
 deeply challenge us about our own way of life. Lord, we desire to be an

118
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,680
 alternative society in this moment of Hong Kong's history. Lord, would you teach

119
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,560
 us how we should die? We pray this in Jesus' name.

120
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,660
 Everyone says. This is an amazing poem. It's not a poem in structural style like

121
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,000
 a Greco-Roman poem of the first century. Instead what Paul's doing is he's using

122
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,900
 language and words and structure to highlight something of honor and value

123
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,280
 about the person he's writing about. He's writing about Jesus and he wants us to

124
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,520
 see the honor and the value of Jesus. Now it's hard to see it in the English, but

125
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,400
 when you look at it in the Greek, you begin to understand how he structures it.

126
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,320
 So I want to show you the structure that is there in the Greek and if you go to

127
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,000
 the next slide, what you'll see is basically the center of his poem is that

128
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,160
 one phrase, "even death on a cross" and above that there are three stanzas of

129
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,240
 three lines. Do you see that? And then below it there are another three stanzas

130
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,200
 of three lines each. That's how it reads in the Greek and it all funnels in to

131
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,200
 this one statement, "even death on a cross." For Paul, he's laying out the foundation

132
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,560
 of his Christology, the foundation of how he thinks about Jesus and he's saying

133
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,280
 that everything that has ever happened has kind of like funneled into this one

134
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,760
 moment of Jesus on the cross and everything that's ever gonna happen in

135
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,840
 the rest of history flows out of this one moment of the cross. Paul is saying

136
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,560
 basically the cross, Jesus's death on the cross, is the center point of all of

137
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,000
 history. Talking about idea of being in the center, check out this Chinese word

138
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,480
 behind me, a very familiar word to all of us. It's the word for center, for middle.

139
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,200
 It's of course the word that's used to speak of China itself, the middle kingdom.

140
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,960
 And the reason why it's used for that in China is because it's a statement of

141
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,120
 intent. What they're saying is we are the middle kingdom, that everything is west

142
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,640
 or east of us. We are in the middle. Are you with me? In the very same way, Paul is

143
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,120
 taking the cross and he, if you will, he's saying that the cross is the middle

144
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,040
 kingdom of all history, that everything that's ever existed is either west or

145
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,480
 east of this moment of Jesus's death on the cross. He is the center place, the

146
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,200
 middle kingdom of all things. Paul wants to draw our attention to the beautiful

147
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:51,160
 idea that the cross is the pivot point, the turning point of everyone and all of

148
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,400
 creation's history. Now to help us to understand this in the poem itself, Paul

149
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,720
 draws from a whole bunch of Old Testament moments, Old Testament ideas. He

150
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,440
 speaks from Isaiah 40 to Isaiah 55. He talks about Psalm 8. He's pulling from a

151
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,400
 lot of different places. We don't have time today to go into all of that, but I

152
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,640
 want to just point two things out that is found in the Old Testament Jewish

153
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,360
 thinking that comes importantly into Paul's poem. Right in the middle of the

154
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,680
 poem, he says that Jesus is obedient even to death. He uses this word obedience. Now

155
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,480
 for Paul, this is not a word he uses a lot in the book of Philippi or elsewhere,

156
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,640
 but it's an important word for him because he's actually using this word to

157
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,640
 draw a contrast with a significant moment in history. He's going all the way

158
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,720
 back to Genesis chapter 3 and he's saying, "Do you remember that there was

159
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:55,840
 this one man, the first man, Adam, and in Adam's disobedience, all of sin basically

160
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,080
 at that point kind of entered into the world." And he's saying, "It's amazing to me

161
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,920
 that we have at the starting point of all of history this idea of disobedience." So

162
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,600
 picking up on that, he wants to make it clear that the center of the cross is

163
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,720
 not an act of disobedience, it's not an act of oppression, it's not an act where

164
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:22,240
 the enemy won, it's an act of obedience. See, where Adam... you got to follow

165
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,400
 me here. Is everybody okay? You still switched on? Okay, here, listen to this. Where Adam was

166
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:33,880
 disobedient to God and brought the world into death, Jesus is obedient to death to

167
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:41,520
 bring the world into life. Come on guys. I mean this is profound theology that

168
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,600
 Paul is pulling together here. The disobedience of Adam, one man, everything

169
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,320
 into sin. The obedience of one man to death, bringing everything into life. This

170
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,200
 is why Paul describes Paul elsewhere as the new Adam, the second Adam, because

171
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,280
 there's a whole new life, east and west, centering around him. Are you tracking with this?

172
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,660
 Now the second thing he does is he, in the second half of the poem, he speaks

173
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,600
 about the name that is above every name. And this draws Paul all the way back to

174
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,800
 the other really important time in Israel's history, the Exodus. And it

175
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,680
 actually literally pulls us to that Exodus 3 moment, where Moses is

176
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,720
 encountered by a burning bush and God's presence is there and God declares to

177
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,120
 Moses, "I have seen the suffering of my people and I desire to now come down and

178
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,440
 to set my people free." That's Paul's passion, oh sorry, that's Jesus's

179
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,320
 passion communicated at the burning bush. And Paul draws on that because Moses

180
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,400
 says to God in reply this, "Who are you? What is your name?" And God's reply is, "I

181
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:54,280
 am who I am." Which comes known in the Hebrew as this idea of Yahweh, the name

182
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,520
 for their God. Which in the Greek version of the Old Testament is translated as

183
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,400
 Lord. It's the same word that Paul puts into the poem here, that everyone will

184
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,880
 confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. What Paul's doing is he's connecting the

185
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,760
 cross to that moment in Exodus chapter 3. And he's basically saying this, that

186
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:22,920
 really Jesus is the ultimate culmination of the burning bush narrative. In Jesus's

187
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,720
 life, death and resurrection, God has indeed come to the world and he has set

188
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,040
 his people free of their slavery and oppression. And I think for Paul he even

189
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,800
 thinks that God in that moment of the burning bush already had Jesus in mind.

190
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,320
 That one will come that will break through everything and finally turn this

191
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,400
 world into a place of freedom and liberation, all because of the cross. Are

192
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:57,360
 you with me? So the question we have to ask ourselves is how does Jesus do this?

193
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,040
 I mean how does he liberate us all from oppression and slavery? Well that's

194
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,680
 ultimately what the poem is about. So let me take you right back to the beginning

195
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,160
 of the poem in verse 5. Listen to this. It says, "Your attitude should be the same

196
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,640
 as that of Christ Jesus." Paul starts the poem by saying this poem is all about the

197
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,920
 attitude of Jesus. And by that the Greek word for attitude here means literally

198
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:29,800
 your mindset, your pattern of thinking, the way in which you think is really

199
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:36,560
 really important. And Paul's saying that Jesus was able to go to the cross to pay

200
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,920
 the price for our sin to be able to liberate us from our slavery and

201
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,440
 oppression because he had a certain way of thinking, a certain mindset that he

202
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,720
 had. And the poem is about his mindset. Do you want to know about that? Okay, no one

203
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,640
 really wants to know about that. Are you guys okay? Because I'm gonna preach the

204
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,640
 heck out of this passage, okay? And I want us to enjoy it together. Are you awake

205
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,720
 still? I can see some people nodding off. Do not nod off in the name of Jesus. If

206
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,320
 you nod off I will come and knock you on the head. In love. Here's what Paul says.

207
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:22,200
 He starts in verse 6 and he says, "Jesus, who in the very nature is God." The first

208
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,840
 place he starts with painting this beautiful poem of who Jesus is and his

209
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,120
 mindset, he says, "He is the very nature God. He sits on the throne of all power

210
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,240
 and authority in the world. There is no one else other than Jesus because he is

211
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,360
 the fullness, the very nature." He doesn't say Jesus is like God. He doesn't say

212
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,560
 Jesus is hoping to reflect God a little bit. He certainly doesn't say he's the

213
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,120
 image of God. He says, "No, he is the very nature of God." So it's Paul declaring the

214
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,920
 full deity of Jesus right from the start. You see that? But then very importantly

215
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,800
 introduces us to Jesus's mindset. See, whilst Jesus is the full nature of God,

216
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,600
 which means he has all the power and authority, highest levels of anyone in

217
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,120
 the world, he says, "He did not believe or think that equality with God was

218
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,600
 something to be grasped." That word grasped in the Greek is the word

219
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,480
 hypokmos. Now it's quite a hard word to translate, but scholars essentially mean

220
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,880
 to be taken advantage of or to exploit. So what Paul's saying is, although Jesus

221
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,720
 was completely God, his mindset was not to use his power and authority to

222
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,040
 exploit those under him. You following this? Now this is really important

223
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,320
 because Paul's immediately beginning to draw a contrast to the person of Jesus

224
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,240
 by the language he's using to Caesar in the Greek or Roman Empire. And he's

225
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,640
 saying, "Although around us we see all of these examples of those who are in the

226
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,120
 highest places of power and authority lording over us, exploiting us, taking

227
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,200
 advantage of us, you need to know that the mindset of Jesus, even though he has

228
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,240
 way greater power and authority than Caesar could ever long for, his mindset

229
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,400
 is not to take advantage, not to exploit. Are you with me? Instead, he says this,

230
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:23,480
 "Instead, making himself nothing." Paul uses the word kenosis in the Greek. He

231
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,080
 basically means to empty himself. Now he's not saying he's emptying himself of

232
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,760
 the nature of God. He's emptying himself of the power and the exploitative nature

233
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,880
 of that power, or the potential exploitative nature of that power. He is

234
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,160
 distancing himself. He's emptying himself. And basically he says, and guess what

235
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,920
 he does? He comes and he appears in human likeness. And essentially he comes and,

236
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,800
 excuse me, sorry, yes, excuse me, sorry, yeah, hi, there you go. And he comes and he

237
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,760
 sits amongst us. That's what he does. He comes and sits right down in the midst

238
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,760
 of humanity as a human, just like you and just like you. And just like me. Are you

239
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,000
 uncomfortable? It's okay. It was a little uncomfortable being with Jesus sometimes.

240
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,760
 Sorry. But he comes and he sits amongst us in this world that we're in because he

241
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,200
 wants to be like us. He doesn't want to exploit. He doesn't think being God is

242
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,480
 something that can be grasped, a hold of. Instead he's willing to empty himself so

243
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,920
 he can be amongst us. Are you with me? Now that's already an amazing place

244
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,960
 of great humility. But Paul does not stop there. He goes straight back and he says,

245
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,360
 number one, he doesn't want to be God. He doesn't want to grasp on, exploit that

246
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,800
 power. So he makes us, or he makes himself in the image of us, like the image of

247
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,840
 human kind of-ness. But then he goes a step further. He says he's not even just

248
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,400
 there. He hasn't just done that. But he's then being found in the likeness of a

249
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,600
 servant. He uses the word doulos, which in the Greek means slave. Now you really

250
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,840
 need to pay attention here because this is the phenomenal thing that Paul is

251
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,360
 saying. Jesus didn't take equality with God, something to be exploited. But he

252
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,400
 didn't even take equality with humanity, something to be exploited. Instead he

253
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,440
 took on the very nature of a slave. Now a slave, the word is doulos, it's

254
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,160
 translated servant in most of our Bibles, but it's the same word for slave. A slave

255
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:38,040
 in Greek or Roman culture had no rights, had no freedom, had nothing at all. They

256
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,200
 were literally classified as a non-person. Imagine if you were somebody

257
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,800
 in Greek or Roman society reading this poem, thinking what kind of God would

258
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,920
 give up all of his power and basically become a non-person. This is not a God we

259
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,160
 have ever heard about. And Paul's saying our God, the one that we worship, has

260
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,080
 emptied himself to such a degree that he's not even trying to be human. He's

261
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,880
 actually a slave of all, giving up all of his rights, all of his power, in order

262
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,080
 that others might know a better life. This is Jesus with a bowl of water and a

263
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,360
 piece of rug trying to wash the feet of the one who's about to betray him. A

264
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:30,840
 complete servant, a slave, in order that some might find life. Are you blown away

265
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,800
 so far? Here's the crazy thing, Paul doesn't even stop there. He says, "And then,

266
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:45,000
 not even considering being a slave enough, Jesus becomes obedient to death,

267
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:55,440
 even death, if you will, on a cross." This thing here that we look at as Christians

268
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,440
 and we go, "Woohoo! Victory!" But anyone in the first century reading this poem for the

269
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:08,040
 first time would have gone, "Pain, excruciation, death, destruction, the very

270
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:17,120
 symbol that actually represented Caesar the most." Paul's saying that the place of

271
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,880
 Jesus's greatest obedience was to allow himself to be overcome by the very tool

272
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,560
 of Caesar's tyranny. Because when you thought about Caesar and his power,

273
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,160
 when you thought about his idea of world domination and what he wanted to do with

274
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,400
 his power and authority, it was the cross, the crucifixion of those that stood

275
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,360
 against him, spoke out against him, that basically was the way that he

276
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,440
 retained his power. And so I want you to see what Paul's doing here. Paul

277
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:51,440
 breathtakingly takes the very symbol of Caesar's most hated and brutal power and

278
00:24:51,440 --> 00:25:01,240
 he turns it into a symbol of self-giving divine love. That's what Paul is doing in

279
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,840
 this poem. He's saying the very thing that you think keeps you in power, Caesar,

280
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:13,160
 is the very thing that has broken your power forever. The very thing that you

281
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,920
 thought was going to kill us becomes the very thing that death is enabled to

282
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:26,000
 bring us into life. Are you following this? Now, as amazing as all of that is,

283
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,040
 Paul then goes on and says, because of all of that, a God who doesn't think

284
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,760
 equality of God is something to be exploited, who doesn't even think he

285
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,320
 should be human, who is willing to be a slave in order to go to the cross, that

286
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,640
 God is worthy of our worship. This is why in the second half of the poem he talks

287
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,280
 about worship. He says God then takes him, and this is where he moves into

288
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,160
 resurrection, God takes him from the cross, brings him back into the fullness

289
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,240
 of life, resurrects him, and he uses these words. He says he is now in the highest

290
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,200
 place. He's exalted to the highest place where every knee will bow, every tongue

291
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,800
 will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father. And Paul,

292
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,760
 writing this poem, moving it on as he does, brings it to this crescendo, this

293
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:20,320
 climax at the end of it, where all of the church says, "Amen." Are you with me? Like

294
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,520
 this is the God that we worship. This is why we gather like this and watch online.

295
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,160
 This is why we cool ourselves and hold the name Christian, because we believe

296
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:35,640
 our God had the mindset, the attitude, the thinking to not think he was God, to not

297
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,680
 even think he was good enough to be human, to not even be a slave, but be

298
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,920
 obedient to the very thing that was supposed to kill him forever. And in

299
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:48,000
 trust and faith, God raises him up and we all stand around and say, "Worthy is

300
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,280
 your name." There is no one better. No one better. None but Jesus. We sang it

301
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,840
 earlier. That's why you're singing it. Isn't that beautiful? Now, here's the

302
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:08,000
 thing. If you read this poem and you finish only in a place of worship, you've

303
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,740
 completely missed the point of the poem itself. Sure, this poem should lead the

304
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,480
 church into a place of praise. It's used that way many times. But if all we ever

305
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,120
 do is read a poem like this and it draws us into a worship with Jesus, we've

306
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,200
 actually missed the whole point of why Paul wrote the poem in the first place.

307
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,840
 Notice what he says right at the beginning in verse 5 again. He says, "Your

308
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,320
 attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus." In other words, what Paul's

309
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,960
 saying right at the front, even before he begins to tell you about all this

310
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,620
 amazing stuff Jesus has done, he's saying this poem is not actually about Jesus,

311
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:49,980
 it's actually about you. Everything I'm about to say is actually about you. It's

312
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,900
 not designed. Think of it this way. The point of the poem is not that Jesus

313
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,540
 would be your majesty. The point of the poem is that Jesus would be your mentor.

314
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,940
 That he would be the one that you would model your life after. That you would

315
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,540
 look at Christ and say, "I want to be more like that. I want to think more like that.

316
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:14,300
 I wanted that mindset and that attitude for myself. I want to truly know who he

317
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,440
 is and I want to empty myself of my pride and my brokenness." This is the

318
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,220
 opposite mindset to what I had on my stumping walk at the beginning of this

319
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,620
 year. Where I was like, "Ah God, I want you just to do it straight away." I had more

320
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,900
 the mindset of Caesar than of a disciple of Jesus. I wanted the instant fix, the

321
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,860
 complete miracle, the Santa Claus waving with the wand to deal with all my issues

322
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:42,340
 and Jesus was saying, "The mindset, Andrew, is one where you're willing to go to the

323
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:48,140
 cross. You're willing to say that there's brokenness in me and yeah I want

324
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:54,220
 liberation from it but Lord I need to confess it to you first. I need to humble

325
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:02,940
 myself. I need to realize that there is seduction of power and authority in me. I need to

326
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,580
 realize that it's something I've struggled with all my adult life.

327
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:17,060
 Insecurities, holding on to power. There's an ugliness in me and I need the

328
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:23,660
 mindset of Christ. Otherwise I will shame the cross and I will Peter Jesus every

329
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:32,100
 single time. There's a new way to die, Paul is saying. And it's so important that

330
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,980
 we get this because I think we really struggle with this, particularly here in

331
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,220
 Hong Kong. I think we see this and we think this is great but actually the

332
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,580
 reality is we really struggle with this because I think in Hong Kong we have a

333
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,340
 game and it's a game that we play in our social circles, our spheres of influence

334
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,760
 with our friends, with our family. It's a game we play in our workplaces. It's the

335
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,660
 game of comparison and evaluation and we're constantly, I think, as people in

336
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,260
 Hong Kong comparing and evaluating ourselves in comparison with others

337
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,300
 because we want to know which seat I'm sitting in. And if I'm not sitting in the

338
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,740
 seat of greatest success and greatest ambition and greatest power, then in

339
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,820
 Hong Kong we honor this seat, don't we? But we ignore this seat right here. This

340
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,740
 is why we bring somebody like Marina in front of you and we say 23 years that

341
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:22,700
 her heart, her humility should sober us. But we have a problem in Hong Kong

342
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,020
 because we like the places of power and we do this by asking each other

343
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:32,420
 questions. What school did they go to? What job do they have? Where do they live?

344
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,900
 What car do they drive? What clothes do they wear? Where do they go on holiday?

345
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,660
 And all of these things help us to balance up where we are in the pecking

346
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:45,260
 order so we can discover where it is on which chair that we're sitting. I mean,

347
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,900
 think about it this way. You're at a dinner party and you go to that

348
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,620
 dinner party and you're in the place of power and authority because you like

349
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,060
 yourself. And you go to that dinner party and you meet someone for the first time

350
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,580
 and you say, "Hey, so which school did you go to? Where'd you go to university?" And

351
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:05,460
 then you realize that they went to a better university than you did. So then

352
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,780
 you ask them the next question, "What do you do for a living?" And then you find

353
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:15,620
 out that they're a teacher and you're a lawyer. And then after that you might ask

354
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,340
 them a question like, "Well, where do you live?" And then you find out that they're

355
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,700
 in mid-levels but you live in Côte d'Ivoire. And then in that place you are

356
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,500
 like, "Well, are you married?" And they're like, "Oh yeah, I have a girlfriend." And they

357
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,820
 introduce you to their girlfriend and you realize their girlfriend is way

358
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:39,220
 hotter than yours. And then as we always do in these conversations, you say, "Well,

359
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,300
 can we meet on social? Can we connect that way?" And you

360
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,140
 change, you know, your Instagram profiles and you're looking at that and

361
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,780
 you're like, "Oh, I've got way more followers than they do. That's great.

362
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:56,540
 Are you with me?" We do this too in our churches, in our spirituality.

363
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:04,220
 It's like, "What church do you go to?" "I go to the Vine." "My pastor is better than

364
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:10,820
 your pastor. How many downloads this week?" But we do this in our spirituality too.

365
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,260
 And we joke about it. I'm kind of making fun of it, but I'm making fun of it

366
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,180
 because I'm trying to make an important point to you. That we need to get rid of

367
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,060
 this attitude. Our attitude should be like Christ Jesus, who doesn't exploit,

368
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,860
 who doesn't want power, who doesn't want prestige, who is willing to humble

369
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,140
 himself to come and live amongst us and then humble himself again to a slave

370
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,380
 and then be so obedient that he's willing to go to death on a cross so

371
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,900
 that somebody might find life. What would it look like for you to live like that?

372
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:48,220
 Paul is offering a new way to live that necessitates a new way to die. Christ's

373
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:56,860
 mindset, the mindset of Christ. Humility, sacrifice, servant-heartedness, death to

374
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:05,260
 self. This is the messianic way. It's the way of God. And if we're

375
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,580
 going to build an alternative society in Hong Kong, if you're going to be a part

376
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,460
 of an alternative society, if you want to be a part of a church that looks

377
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,860
 different, that's yeast and dough and not dough and dough, we need to disrupt our

378
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,100
 faulty thinking and begin to think true and good again. You need to learn how to

379
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:26,020
 die again. I'm gonna put it to you straight. It's time that you denied

380
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:36,460
 yourself, picked up your cross again, and followed him. And here's the thing. For

381
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,340
 Paul, this is supposed to happen publicly. This is not us in some private corner

382
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,460
 serving one another in love, although we do that. But you see, as Jesus' people, our

383
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:54,860
 commitment to humility and a sacrifice is a public responsibility as much as it

384
00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:01,900
 is a private spirituality. Come on, church. It's as much a public responsibility as

385
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,540
 it is a private spirituality that we must have. It has to work itself out in

386
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,060
 our hands and our feet. There is a different way to live that necessitates

387
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,860
 a different way to die. It's the messianic way. And Paul is writing this

388
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,140
 poem and he's saying, "Learn to live like this." And if you can learn to live like

389
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:25,380
 this, humbling yourself, dealing with your pride, confessing your sin, walking

390
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,500
 before each other in our reality, our brokenness, longing for breakthrough, but

391
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,580
 not wanting to worship a God that just waves our breakthrough away or waves our

392
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,740
 sin away, but someone who that we come to because of his love, because of his

393
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,820
 sacrifice, that then changes us. That then turns us around in our confession of our

394
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:49,900
 brokenness. As we do all of that, we become the very people Christ wants us

395
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:55,460
 to be. This is like Paul summarizing for us through this poem that one great

396
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:00,980
 thing that Jesus said, "If anybody was to come after me, they must deny themselves,

397
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:09,140
 pick up their cross, and follow me." So let me ask you again, do you want

398
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,060
 breakthrough in your life?

399
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:22,220
 Can we pray? Let's pray.

400
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:31,300
 Father, we bow our heads online and in this room before you, before this

401
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:37,940
 incredible image of the cross of Jesus. And Father, we do so in a place of

402
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:50,140
 humility, humbled by the journey you took. Lord, we're thankful that Paul didn't mince

403
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:55,900
 his words for his church. And in presenting to us this beautiful poem

404
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:03,700
 that causes us to worship and to honor Jesus in ways that perhaps we hadn't

405
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:09,340
 even really thought about. The ultimate point of that is so that we might change.

406
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:15,980
 So that our heart and our attitude and our mindset might be different. And so

407
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:23,700
 Father, we come to you in this moment as your church, desiring breakthrough and

408
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,500
 resurrection, but not wanting to make the mistakes of having a mindset of this

409
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:39,700
 world in that process. Lord, where our pride gets in our way in this city, would

410
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:48,420
 you forgive us? Lord, where our materialism blinds us from the poor,

411
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:59,620
 would you forgive us? Where our attitudes fight for us to be on the throne, would

412
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:07,220
 you forgive us? We come before you as a church desiring to be this alternative

413
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:15,540
 society, learning what it is to pick up our cross. I wonder whether you would

414
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:22,420
 just take a moment between you and God, and perhaps just allow the Holy Spirit

415
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,620
 to show you anything in your life.

416
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:39,100
 Anything that is more Caesar thinking than Jesus thinking. Jesus wants you to

417
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:47,380
 walk the messianic path. And I believe that the enemy has a strategy or

418
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:55,460
 stronghold over our thinking. This is why Paul later would say that we need a

419
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:04,180
 renewing of our minds in Romans 12. Here he says your patterns of thinking must

420
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:11,380
 be like Christ Jesus. And so allow the Holy Spirit just to come right now and

421
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:17,460
 maybe show you. And like I said earlier, you know, Jesus does this because he loves

422
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,100
 us. He's not this angry schoolmaster who's telling us off, but he loves us

423
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:31,020
 with the cross. And he challenges us to pick up our cross. And yes, we have

424
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:39,460
 salvation, liberation, and freedom in him, but we don't have a Santa Claus. We have

425
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:46,300
 a God who would show Thomas and others the scars in his hands. The hard-fought

426
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:55,980
 victory of obedience to death. Where is it that you might need to die? What is it

427
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:04,740
 that you need to die to? What attitudes, mindsets, thoughts is Christ calling you

428
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:12,020
 to die to today? To confess to him so that you might know the fullness of life.

429
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:17,940
 Just take some time to spend your own time with God and bring whatever prayer

430
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,780
 of confession you may need to bring. And we're gonna worship together then as a

431
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,660
 church as we respect and honor the one who has humbled himself so beautifully.

432
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,900
 May we therefore humble ourselves now.
