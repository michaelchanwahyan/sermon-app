1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
 We're gonna be doing something a little bit different today,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,640
 which is really exciting.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,960
 We wanna help you to hear from different voices

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,920
 in our church, rather than just those

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,720
 that are often the ones that are preaching.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,080
 We wanna make sure that we make space for different voices

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,720
 and different insight and different wisdom.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,880
 And I'm super excited about this.

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,140
 Pastor Promise is gonna come and lead this time.

10
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,840
 Can we put our hands together for Promise

11
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,020
 and for everybody else that's gonna be joining him on stage?

12
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,760
 (audience applauding)

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,340
 - Thank you, thank you.

14
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,460
 Come on, you guys, come on up.

15
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,360
 It's all right, don't be afraid.

16
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,400
 Can't back out now, it's too late.

17
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,720
 This is being recorded.

18
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,280
 All right.

19
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,840
 What's for it?

20
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,760
 We'll let the married couple share a mic, it'll be good.

21
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,720
 All right, well, everyone, I wanna introduce myself

22
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,440
 'cause you know who I am.

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,000
 But I just wanna go ahead and introduce

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,520
 some of the people that we have with us.

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,680
 And then we're gonna jump right in.

26
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,240
 So to my left, we have Pastor Emma,

27
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,580
 which you are used to seeing her here.

28
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,460
 She's been on our team for a while, leading worship.

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,960
 She is one of our worship pastors.

30
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,680
 To my right, we have Juju, who leads worship in the PM.

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,560
 So normally, if you're here at the two o'clock service,

32
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,200
 you would see her right here about this tall.

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,500
 It's quite nice.

34
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,440
 We love her dearly.

35
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,960
 To her right, we have Mr. Smith.

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,080
 These two are married, by the way,

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,280
 so give it up for marriage, everyone.

38
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,320
 We love that in God's house, amen, amen.

39
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,080
 Mr. Smith, Akin, is also joining us today to share.

40
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,340
 And then to his right, my favorite Indonesian man

41
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,580
 in the whole wide world.

42
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,820
 This is Pastor Jethro, and he's taken, just for the record.

43
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,520
 But Pastor Jethro, everyone, let's give it up for him.

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,300
 (audience applauding)

45
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,180
 Engaged man, man to be married, ah, all right.

46
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,740
 Well, let me just tell you guys

47
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,580
 what we're hoping to do today.

48
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,580
 We would love to just have some conversations

49
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,380
 around what it means to worship in spirit and in truth,

50
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,660
 and just kind of sit in that space,

51
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,100
 understanding that in lots of our lives

52
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,060
 we can be pulled towards these dichotomous concepts.

53
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,260
 And actually, we serve a God who is whole and complete.

54
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,180
 And so as we go through this, we're gonna see

55
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,100
 just how he pulls us into this completion that he has.

56
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,200
 So as Pastor Andrew has shared,

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,100
 we started this series on the Holy Spirit.

58
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,100
 This week, we're looking at John 4,

59
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,460
 looking at Jesus and the Samaritan woman,

60
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,380
 and the concept and the big idea

61
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,740
 that we're gonna be talking around is around worship.

62
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,260
 So in order for us to actually, I guess,

63
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,940
 have a common vocabulary and understanding

64
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,940
 of what worship is, I'm gonna pass it

65
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,060
 to our worship pastor, Emanuela,

66
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,260
 one of our worship pastors, who will be giving us

67
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,980
 a definition on what worship is for this community.

68
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,980
 So go ahead, Emma.

69
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,500
 - Yes, so hi, hi, everyone.

70
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,980
 So I will caveat this by saying this is obviously

71
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,960
 not an exhaustive definition of what worship is,

72
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,040
 but for the purposes of this conversation

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,940
 and as a community, when we talk about worship,

74
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,260
 how we define it is an adequate and appropriate

75
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,580
 responding to and revealing of God the Father,

76
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,960
 Christ Jesus the Son, and the Spirit that lives within us.

77
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,980
 And so in short, we say revelation and response

78
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,260
 when we're talking, what is worship,

79
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,220
 revelation and response?

80
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,100
 So the adequate and appropriate revealing of

81
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,660
 and responding to God the Father, Christ Jesus the Son,

82
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,700
 and the Spirit that remains with us.

83
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,420
 - So that means worship takes place when God is revealed

84
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,740
 through the way that we live,

85
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,220
 and when we also respond to that revelation of who God is.

86
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,380
 That means it can take place here in this room,

87
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,180
 just like we just all experienced,

88
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,580
 but also means that it's not simply limited

89
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,680
 to the worship service and the gathering, right?

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,140
 So today we're gonna look at John chapter four.

91
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,500
 Let me just give us a little bit of what's happening

92
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,340
 in John chapter four.

93
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,300
 Jesus is in Samaria, and he's at this well,

94
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,740
 and this lady is there, and he's thirsty,

95
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,380
 he wants something to drink, and he asks her for a drink,

96
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,180
 and they have this discourse around water

97
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,620
 and how he's like, you know, Jesus always does this

98
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,460
 when someone asks him a simple question,

99
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,460
 he always gives some profound answer

100
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,900
 that doesn't really answer the question, right?

101
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,900
 And so she's like, he wants water,

102
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,820
 and then all of a sudden he's the well that never runs dry,

103
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,100
 but he's the one asking for water,

104
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,860
 and she should be asking him for a drink.

105
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,460
 So it feels a little bit confusing,

106
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,180
 and then it goes into this whole idea

107
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,700
 of Jesus kind of calling out, oh, well, you know,

108
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,300
 you have five husbands, which seems a little bit weird,

109
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,580
 just kind of out of the blue,

110
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,180
 Jesus calls her out on her life.

111
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,420
 And then it transitions into this idea of, you know,

112
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,860
 Jews worship on one mountain,

113
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,180
 but Samaritans worship on a different mountain,

114
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,780
 and it's in this space that we get the crux

115
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,820
 of today's talk around what worship truly looks like.

116
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,660
 So if you could turn your attention to the screen,

117
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,820
 I'm gonna read this for us,

118
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,060
 starting at verse 19 of John chapter four.

119
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,300
 It says this, "Sir," the woman said,

120
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,820
 "I can see that you're a prophet,"

121
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,300
 which is a good response,

122
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,100
 given that he's just told her all this stuff about her life.

123
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,340
 "Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain,

124
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,800
 "but you Jews claim that the place

125
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,180
 "where we must worship is in Jerusalem."

126
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,820
 "Woman," Jesus replied, "believe me,

127
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,280
 "a time is coming when you will worship the Father,

128
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,580
 "neither on this mountain or in Jerusalem.

129
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,980
 "You Samaritans worship what you do not know.

130
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,700
 "We worship what we do know,

131
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,660
 "for salvation is from the Jews.

132
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,400
 "Yet a time is coming, and has now come,

133
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,140
 "when true worshipers will worship the Father

134
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,900
 "in spirit and in truth,

135
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,500
 "for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks."

136
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,880
 Jesus, we thank you this morning for your word,

137
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,880
 and we just ask, Holy Spirit, that you would be with us

138
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,840
 as we converse around it, as we pull it apart,

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,520
 and as we see the insight that you have

140
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,040
 for us to live our lives.

141
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,600
 We know that your word is living and active,

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,160
 so would you speak to us now, in Jesus' name, amen.

143
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,560
 Also, I'll just toss a question out.

144
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,000
 The idea of worshiping in spirit and in truth,

145
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,720
 you can't just do one over the other.

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,020
 It's a false dichotomy,

147
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,800
 but what makes it a false dichotomy in you guys' take?

148
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,540
 Why can you not worship in spirit or in truth?

149
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
 You have to do both.

150
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,940
 - Because I think both reveals God, right?

151
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,820
 So if you understand that, talk about this truth,

152
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,140
 truth as we know it is the word of God.

153
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,540
 The word of God came in flesh into Jesus,

154
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,620
 and the spirit, meaning the Holy Spirit that he has given us,

155
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,860
 the Holy Spirit will bring us to revelation

156
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,220
 of who Jesus is, and Jesus already said himself

157
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,360
 that he does not do anything

158
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,200
 that he doesn't see the Father do.

159
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,560
 So in short, Jesus reveals the Father,

160
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,440
 so the Holy Spirit reveals the Jesus,

161
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,420
 which is the word and the truth,

162
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,880
 and Jesus reveals the Father.

163
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,600
 So three in one.

164
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
 - Trinity thing, right?

165
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,280
 It's a trinity.

166
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,440
 - So if we go back to that description or definition,

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,520
 if worship is revealing and responding,

168
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,280
 and we're worshiping God, then who we're revealing,

169
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,560
 our revelation of him has to be accurate.

170
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,420
 And because to the Christian faith,

171
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,680
 our God is three in one, our worship of that God,

172
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,320
 and so the revelation of his nature

173
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,200
 must align with who he actually is.

174
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,400
 And so in spirit and in truth encompasses,

175
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,240
 like in that passage, it's very interesting,

176
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,000
 it kind of highlights the trinity

177
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,440
 without using the word trinity, right?

178
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,080
 So it says, "The Father seeks worshipers

179
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,960
 "that worship in the spirit and in truth."

180
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,140
 And we know from John 14, six later on

181
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,760
 that Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."

182
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,020
 So you see clearly in that kind of outline

183
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,080
 of how worship is to take place,

184
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,120
 the picture of the full trinity.

185
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,040
 And so to separate and choose between spirit or truth

186
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,520
 would be to separate the Godhead,

187
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,080
 which would then change, I don't know if it constitute,

188
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,440
 it wouldn't constitute worship

189
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,200
 to the God we worship as believers.

190
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,920
 So I think it's impossible to break them up.

191
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,760
 It's impossible, but it's also dangerous, right?

192
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,000
 I think none of us go into it saying,

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,860
 "Okay, I'm gonna just worship in spirit.

194
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,160
 "I'm gonna just worship in truth and ignore the others."

195
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,080
 But I think as humans, we are drawn to extremes sometimes.

196
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,440
 And if we're not careful, we can find ourselves

197
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,700
 over-saturated on the other side of the line.

198
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,160
 And so let's talk about the Old Testament.

199
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,660
 We see in the scriptures, not Old Testament, the Pharisees.

200
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,280
 I think someone mentioned the Pharisees.

201
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,160
 Akin, this is your point, go ahead and talk about it.

202
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,040
 Tell us what happened.

203
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,120
 - Yeah, it's something we discussed

204
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,720
 in the 9am, 9.15 service.

205
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,600
 So yes, it's impossible to honestly worship God

206
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,880
 without doing so in spirit and in truth.

207
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,480
 But my promise is there is the danger

208
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,080
 of trying to sort of gravitate towards one.

209
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,920
 And if we think of the Pharisees,

210
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,960
 this is very likely a very good example

211
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,640
 of a body of people who likely gravitated

212
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,680
 more towards the word and almost forgot entirely

213
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,480
 about the spirit aspect of it.

214
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,200
 So they spent so much time reading the word,

215
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,560
 they could actually memorize, they had memorized it,

216
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,680
 they could recite it, verbatim.

217
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,560
 But Jesus was walking amongst them

218
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,320
 and they couldn't actually recognize him

219
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,240
 because they were so much focused on the word.

220
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,000
 And I think that is a danger.

221
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,280
 That's something that we definitely want to do our best

222
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,800
 to actually ensure that does not happen with our lives.

223
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,200
 'Cause I promise that it can be a slippery slope.

224
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,800
 We can very easily sort of just gravitate towards one.

225
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,000
 And I mean, I don't think anyone of us here

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,680
 wants to emulate the Pharisees.

227
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,400
 All of them mistakes that they made.

228
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,360
 So good thing to keep in mind and keep them as an example.

229
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
 - And Jesus is actually kind of a little harsh to them

230
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,400
 in some extent.

231
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,480
 It's like when you see the Pharisees living their lives,

232
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,600
 right, like they know all the laws, like I can said,

233
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,800
 they could pray the best, they were fasting,

234
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,040
 they were doing all the things, they looked the part.

235
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,520
 But the way that Jesus would respond to them,

236
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,920
 he would call them whitewashed tombs, empty on the inside.

237
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,000
 Their spirits were not actually connecting with him.

238
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,440
 He would also say that these people worship me

239
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,440
 with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.

240
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,880
 It really does seem that if we omit the spirit,

241
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,920
 we actually miss on what it looks like

242
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,200
 to biblically worship God.

243
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,680
 - Yeah, I think Jethro made a really good point earlier,

244
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,200
 and you can expand on this, but about how if we lean,

245
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,240
 if we decide to lean, so this is on the dangers

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,760
 of leaning more truth, like I'm gonna worship in truth.

247
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,040
 And that's a fair response to seeing people worship God

248
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,920
 in however way they want, which we'll get to.

249
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,140
 But one of the dangers of that becomes self-righteousness,

250
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,620
 'cause you start to believe that your worship is acceptable

251
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,320
 because you have dotted all of the I's

252
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,480
 and crossed all the T's, which we know is not true, right?

253
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,440
 Scripture is like your righteousness,

254
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,840
 at most righteous, is filthy rags before me.

255
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,880
 So like the way that your worship is accepted

256
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,400
 is never because of how great you've done.

257
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,680
 The Pharisees, again, like where people,

258
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,520
 I had a friend who used to say the Pharisees knew the word

259
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,520
 and the truth so well that if you rolled up a scroll

260
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,760
 and you shot through it and they unrolled it,

261
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,000
 they could tell you what letter had been,

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,720
 like literally, it was that a G that was removed.

263
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,340
 Like it's an analogy for how well they knew the scripture

264
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,680
 that they could really recite every iota of it.

265
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,780
 But then that kinda leads to that difficult place

266
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,160
 where you're leaning on yourself, which is kinda hard,

267
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,480
 'cause we're not the most consistent people.

268
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,200
 So then if our hope for an acceptable worship

269
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,120
 is our goodness and our ability to maintain

270
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,800
 God's level of standards,

271
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,000
 then we wouldn't have an acceptable worship

272
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,080
 for very long, if ever.

273
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,920
 I know I wouldn't, I don't know about you guys.

274
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,240
 Maybe you guys are like deeper, but like as for me,

275
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,080
 I already know I'm grateful for the Holy Spirit,

276
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,360
 'cause I'm like otherwise, there's no way, there's no way.

277
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,760
 - The truth is a person, and I think one of the things

278
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,280
 that we didn't talk on earlier,

279
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,200
 but I think is interesting in this state is

280
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
 if Jesus is the truth and truth is a person,

281
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
 then you kinda have to get to know the truth, right?

282
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,200
 Can you maybe, Jet, what does that,

283
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,040
 when you think about the idea

284
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,640
 of we have to get to know Jesus, what does that mean?

285
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,600
 What does that look like?

286
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,640
 - Well, Jesus, this is the next point,

287
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,400
 but Jesus comes to, he says, comes to fulfill the law.

288
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,080
 He's not come to abolish the law.

289
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,360
 And he's given the word is, the word of God is Jesus.

290
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,680
 So getting to know Jesus is also getting to know

291
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,200
 what he's spoken through the Bible.

292
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,360
 And knowing what he has said,

293
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,000
 and we can understand his character more,

294
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,120
 and so that we know the person, right?

295
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,880
 If you want to know a person,

296
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
 you don't just observe them from afar.

297
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,400
 You get to know them, you ask questions and all that.

298
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,280
 - Now, just to jump in on that in terms of

299
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,040
 what you just said, I think it's very possible to

300
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,600
 miss out on exactly what Jesus was looking to do,

301
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,040
 because there were times when what Jesus did

302
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,720
 seemed to contradict the law,

303
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,880
 even though, like you said,

304
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,680
 he did not come to abolish the law,

305
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,840
 so laws of like Sabbath and the like.

306
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,160
 You could sort of mistake that

307
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,800
 and think that Jesus came to do something otherwise,

308
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,880
 but he makes it clear that that is not the case.

309
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,360
 So it's more about the actual relationship

310
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,800
 and the actual spirit of the law,

311
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,920
 which is why it's important to take both the word

312
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,640
 and the spirit and not individually.

313
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,520
 - And I don't think the Pharisees recognized it,

314
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
 but I think if they were to zoom out and realize,

315
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,440
 I think the example of the man who was healed on the Sabbath,

316
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,720
 like they want to persecute Jesus

317
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,080
 'cause he healed someone on the Sabbath

318
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,760
 because they were so, they knew the truth,

319
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,160
 but they missed the spirit of who God was

320
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,680
 and God's heart for people,

321
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,080
 that they would then try and kill someone

322
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,600
 who helped somebody because they did it on the wrong day.

323
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,600
 Like, can we talk about missing the big picture altogether?

324
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,760
 I think that says something to us,

325
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,040
 that God isn't just calling you to like do all the rules

326
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
 and make sure you're living exactly perfectly right.

327
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,360
 There is a relationship

328
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,080
 and that's why the spirit matters so much in this worship.

329
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,240
 - Yeah, so that's on what are some of the dangers

330
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,480
 of leaning too much, right?

331
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,600
 When we say spirit and truth and leaning on truth.

332
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,720
 Jules, what do you think are some of the pitfalls

333
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,200
 of leaning, swinging into the other end of the pendulum

334
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,600
 and like just by the spirit, no need for truth?

335
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,480
 - Well, I grew up in a Pentecostal church.

336
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,960
 - All the spirit.

337
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,800
 - Yeah, it's all spirit, right?

338
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,800
 So like it's very concentrated on like,

339
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,520
 someone can be rolling on the floor,

340
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,960
 but then if there's really no truth to it,

341
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,000
 'cause truth is also the whole being, right?

342
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,320
 Like your heart, is it really showing the heart of God?

343
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,160
 Then is it really worship that you're rolling on the floor

344
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,120
 or you're like being slain?

345
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,960
 Yeah, sorry, to surprise everyone.

346
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,280
 I didn't wanna scare anyone,

347
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,640
 but that's what I grew up with.

348
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,920
 Yeah, so that can be the danger of that.

349
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,880
 - And in this age, I think specifically 2025,

350
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,400
 like if worship is only in the spirit,

351
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,360
 I mean, we've heard the phrase my truth so many times,

352
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,680
 not everybody has their own truth,

353
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,600
 but there's only one real truth, right?

354
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,520
 There's only Jesus is the truth.

355
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,520
 So your truth and their truth and his truth and her truth,

356
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,520
 I think really having the concept of marrying the spirit

357
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,880
 with the truth, right?

358
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,360
 The truth being Jesus is super important.

359
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,880
 - Yeah, I think something that can be hard to grasp

360
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,880
 in this day and age is that God is king,

361
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,760
 like of all things, right?

362
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,040
 He is God.

363
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,480
 So like he answers to no one, okay?

364
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,960
 And because he is God,

365
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,640
 and he's also a father and all those things,

366
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,120
 but he is God, our father is God, right?

367
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,240
 So like there is that duality to like who he is

368
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,920
 and completeness, that means he,

369
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,720
 the recipient of our worship,

370
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,240
 gets to dictate the method of our worship, right?

371
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,200
 The way in any loving relationship,

372
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,440
 you know, for those who are married

373
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,160
 or like you have siblings or friends,

374
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,440
 you know their preferences and what they don't like, right?

375
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,800
 If your spouse's love language is quality time,

376
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,240
 buying them the latest, like, I don't know,

377
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,040
 Gucci, whatever, is not gonna matter

378
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,440
 if what they require of you is time, right?

379
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
 So the same goes with God.

380
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,480
 In this relationship with him, he dictates how we worship.

381
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,080
 And we learn what he dictates through his word,

382
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,480
 through the truth, right?

383
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,360
 So the spirit gives us that affection for God,

384
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,240
 the desire to worship him,

385
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,200
 but even with good intentions,

386
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,960
 unless we learn what he wants,

387
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,520
 it becomes, the intentions become wasted, right?

388
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,240
 All the money a husband could spend

389
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,800
 on like the latest whatever,

390
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,320
 and the wife is like, but I asked you to take out the trash,

391
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,200
 and it was a lot cheaper,

392
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,760
 would have been a lot cheaper to do that.

393
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,840
 Like, it's the same with God.

394
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,000
 I'm reminded of, and this is gonna sound very intense,

395
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,960
 but there's a story of Uzzah in scripture.

396
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,040
 Uzzah is this man where,

397
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,080
 it's way back in the Old Testament,

398
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,960
 and there's like, the children of Israel

399
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,680
 are at war with the Philistines.

400
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,000
 So the Philistines take the Ark of the Lord.

401
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
 At the time, the Ark of God was symbolic

402
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,000
 of the presence of God,

403
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,960
 and they thought the presence of God was,

404
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,600
 like Pastor Andrew talked about in the introduction,

405
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,800
 that it was an energy.

406
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,200
 So like, whoever has the energy has the wind.

407
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,440
 That's not how it works.

408
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,840
 So they stole the Ark,

409
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
 thinking the energy was gonna be in their favor,

410
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,440
 and then God started smiting them,

411
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
 and they all started dying.

412
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,480
 So they kept playing,

413
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
 they started playing hot potato with the Ark,

414
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,720
 and they're like, "Ah, send it to the next town,"

415
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,320
 and like, "Whatever city you don't like,

416
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,280
 "we're shipping it to Singapore, whatever."

417
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,400
 - Shots at Singapore.

418
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,160
 Shots at Singapore.

419
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,000
 We love you, Singapore.

420
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,520
 - Easy target, we do love you.

421
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,280
 But yeah, so.

422
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,360
 (laughing)

423
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,560
 Sorry.

424
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,880
 So, they're playing hot potato with the Ark of God, okay?

425
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,600
 And eventually, it lands in the house of an Israelite.

426
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,440
 They finally get it.

427
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,480
 They send it to one of the people of God,

428
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,920
 and their people stop dying, right?

429
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,880
 The thing is, though,

430
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,560
 the Philistines are not the people of God,

431
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,200
 so they don't have a relationship with God.

432
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
 They don't know how God dictates to be worshipped.

433
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,240
 So they put God, they carry the Ark

434
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,560
 the way that they would carry their God.

435
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,960
 They carry it in an Ark on top of oxen

436
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,800
 with like, golden idols and stuff,

437
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
 and they bring it to the Israelite's house.

438
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,640
 Because that Israelite wasn't a priest,

439
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,040
 and they didn't really bother to like, find out.

440
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,440
 The Ark of God just stayed that way in their house, right?

441
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,960
 So, fast forward, I don't know how many years later,

442
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,760
 when King David becomes king,

443
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,000
 one of the first thing he wants to do

444
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 is restore the presence of God, symbolically,

445
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,960
 the Ark of God, to the center of worship in Israel.

446
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,040
 So he goes, he inquires, they tell him,

447
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,400
 "Oh, it's at that guy's house."

448
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,960
 They go to that guy's house to pick up the Ark, right?

449
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,760
 But remember, they're carrying the Ark

450
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,800
 the way the Philistines carry their God.

451
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,280
 God, in Deuteronomy and other parts,

452
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,560
 had been specific about how his presence

453
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,840
 was supposed to be carried.

454
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,720
 It had to be carried on people,

455
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,120
 which is a precursor to the fact

456
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
 that we would become his temple, right?

457
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,400
 So people had to carry his presence.

458
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,280
 It couldn't be animals, it couldn't be whatever else.

459
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,480
 Like, you couldn't decide how you wanted

460
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,420
 to carry his presence, you had to carry it his way.

461
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,640
 But they didn't know that.

462
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,140
 So they pick up the Ark, and they're just excited,

463
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,160
 'cause they're like, "Oh, yeah,

464
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,440
 "the presence of God is back."

465
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,840
 Which is spirit, like, good intentions, excited, right?

466
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,200
 And I'm sure the spirit of God led that decision,

467
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,680
 that if we're gonna be a kingdom after God,

468
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,960
 we ought to centralize his presence.

469
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,040
 But they didn't do the work of finding out,

470
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,580
 okay, but truthfully, how does God want to be worshipped?

471
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,000
 So they're carrying this Ark

472
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,880
 the way the Philistines would carry the Ark.

473
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,300
 They're going, they're going, they're going,

474
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,480
 and then they find there's a hole in the ground.

475
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,800
 The oxen, the animals who are carrying the Ark, trip.

476
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,120
 And the Ark of God, which was on these animals,

477
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,880
 start to tip over, right?

478
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,440
 And so you can imagine, like, panic.

479
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,840
 "Oh my God, this is the presence of God,

480
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,920
 "we can't let it fall."

481
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,520
 This guy, Uzzah, is like, "No!"

482
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,400
 And he touches the Ark to try to, like, lean it right,

483
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,200
 and drops dead.

484
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,760
 Go find it, it's in your Bibles.

485
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,900
 (laughing)

486
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,640
 I can give you the coordinates later.

487
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
 He touches it, and it drops dead.

488
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,960
 And King David is so distraught, right?

489
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,160
 So he stops the whole,

490
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,000
 "We're gonna bring the presence of God,"

491
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,800
 'cause like, "Shoo, what is this?

492
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,240
 "Like, I don't wanna die."

493
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,680
 And the scripture says he's actually angry at God.

494
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,100
 He's like, "Why would you do that?

495
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,440
 "Like, we're bringing your presence back.

496
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,080
 "What, shouldn't you be happy?"

497
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,400
 But remember, God is king, right?

498
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,380
 So we can't carry his presence,

499
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,160
 even when it's his idea for us to centralize it.

500
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,840
 We can't do it our way.

501
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,880
 We have to do it his way.

502
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,560
 I think this is where the strength

503
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,480
 of the truth comes in, right?

504
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,680
 So in spirit, like, with the right intentions,

505
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,360
 with the right passion in the movement,

506
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,080
 but we have to do the work of discovering

507
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,120
 through his word,

508
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,600
 how do you actually want us to worship you?

509
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,040
 And the spirit, like, highlights, you know,

510
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,980
 what to focus on in every instance,

511
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,700
 but that's where the danger could come in.

512
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,440
 Like, good intentions,

513
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,080
 going straight into the presence of God,

514
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,480
 not being aware, "Oh, I'm walking into

515
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,560
 "the presence of someone who's holy,

516
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,680
 "who wants us to be in his presence."

517
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,280
 So, you know, it ends happily,

518
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,180
 where, I mean, us are still dead, but.

519
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,920
 It ends, they go away, David's upset.

520
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
 He goes and finds out.

521
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,880
 And then they're like, "Oh, we're not supposed

522
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,760
 "to carry the presence of God on animals."

523
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,680
 Right, and they don't know that it's because

524
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,640
 in the future, God's presence will live on people,

525
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,760
 so we need to know that,

526
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,720
 and it needs to be consistent, right?

527
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,360
 They learn that, and they carry the presence of God

528
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,120
 properly, and it's a proper party, right?

529
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,640
 His presence comes in and dwells,

530
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,680
 like, he wants to, but it's just,

531
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,440
 we can't do it our way.

532
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,920
 - Deuteronomy gives a good definition of it.

533
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,200
 Deuteronomy 12, four, he goes,

534
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
 "You must not worship the Lord your God in their way,

535
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,000
 "but you are to seek the place that the Lord

536
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,400
 "will choose from among your tribes."

537
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,920
 God is going to define what worship looks like,

538
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,280
 and that's what we get here in the New Testament passage,

539
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,360
 in John four, that true worshipers,

540
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,720
 like, what does God require for worship to look like?

541
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,040
 It's this combination of our worship being

542
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,000
 in spirit and in truth.

543
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,960
 There's a quote from a theologian I wanna read to us,

544
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,400
 'cause I think it really helps us frame it well.

545
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,040
 It says this, "Truth without emotion

546
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,160
 "produces dead orthodoxy,

547
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,460
 "and a church full of artificial admirers.

548
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,480
 "On the other hand, emotion without truth

549
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,660
 "produces empty frenzy, and cultivates shallow people

550
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,800
 "who refuse the discipline of rigorous thought.

551
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,320
 "But true worship comes from people

552
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,720
 "who are deeply emotional,

553
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,940
 "who love deep and sound doctrine.

554
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,080
 "Strong affections for God rooted in truth

555
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,960
 "are the bone and marrow of biblical worship."

556
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,100
 Our worship must be this coming together,

557
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,200
 this combination led by his spirit

558
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,200
 to reveal the truth of who Jesus is,

559
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,880
 and it's a consistent cycle that we then get a chance

560
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,340
 to reveal and respond to as well.

561
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,160
 I heard earlier that Juju and Emma were hanging out

562
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,400
 without me and talking about Bible things without me.

563
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,760
 Emma snitched on you, by the way,

564
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,600
 and she said that you guys came up

565
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,880
 with a really cool definition,

566
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,640
 kind of like summarizing the whole idea of truth

567
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,260
 and worship and spirit and Jesus

568
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,300
 and all those things together.

569
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,820
 So maybe you can read it for us

570
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,140
 so we can all kind of sit with it.

571
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,220
 You want my phone?

572
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,500
 There you go.

573
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,060
 - True worship of God must be led by the spirit

574
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,180
 and must arrive at a revelation of the person of Christ.

575
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,960
 Just this morning, I was kind of,

576
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,020
 like I was praying for today,

577
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,660
 and I was like, oh God, I really,

578
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,460
 I don't want to do it.

579
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,140
 I don't want to do it anymore.

580
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,500
 Like, English is not my first language.

581
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,940
 I don't speak as eloquently as my husband,

582
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,200
 but then the Lord said,

583
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,500
 this is how I want to be worshipped, right?

584
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,180
 Like today it looks different.

585
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,960
 Like, yeah, last Sunday, yeah,

586
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,780
 you're worshiping here on the stage

587
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,260
 with music and with sound,

588
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,760
 but today I want to be worshipped this way.

589
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,620
 And the spirit, you know,

590
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,260
 the spirit allows us and helps us

591
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,080
 to things that we can't even do.

592
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,460
 Like true worship, you can never really worship God

593
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,700
 because it's impossible.

594
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,700
 Because God, like the only way is for the spirit

595
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,980
 to reveal to you.

596
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,940
 Without the spirit, you cannot.

597
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,420
 Yeah?

598
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,260
 - Yeah.

599
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,980
 - I think, no, no, you're completely right.

600
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,300
 Like I think it is that combination.

601
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,840
 Like we are dependent on the spirit

602
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,980
 to lead us and guide us into that space.

603
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,060
 There was something really interesting

604
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,500
 when we kind of discussed this earlier

605
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,060
 around the biblical response.

606
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,820
 Emma calls it step zero.

607
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,740
 But Akin, you were actually pulling together

608
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,100
 just the overall narrative of John 4,

609
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,940
 looking at how, you know, it's not disconnected.

610
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,460
 We don't just randomly hear about the spirit,

611
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,520
 but actually what Jesus does with this woman

612
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,260
 kind of sets up this idea of sacrifice and repentance, right?

613
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,040
 So how would you kind of explain that

614
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,180
 for us all to understand?

615
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,980
 - Yeah, I don't think we read through the entire passage,

616
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,740
 but at least prior to the bits that we read,

617
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,200
 we see Jesus call out this lady's sin.

618
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,340
 So he mentioned how she has had five husbands,

619
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,200
 and the person she's with now is actually not her husband.

620
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,660
 So Jesus does something very interesting

621
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,640
 where I guess it's easy for us as people

622
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,560
 to sort of gloss over sin

623
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,320
 and maybe not really call it out,

624
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,720
 not really speak to it.

625
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,900
 But sin can be seen as sort of the offshoot

626
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,040
 of something that's wrong within us

627
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,360
 that could very easily be another idol,

628
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,480
 another thing that we end up worshiping other than God,

629
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,460
 which then leads us to express it in different sins.

630
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,440
 So, I mean, I won't claim to know exactly

631
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,360
 what was on the lady's mind,

632
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,400
 but it's very likely that she had bought into this lie,

633
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,440
 this idea that, you know, relationships, partners

634
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,800
 would be the way that she can, you know, feel whole

635
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,440
 and, you know, be what, you know,

636
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,160
 whatever she thinks she's meant to be.

637
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,300
 But then that just makes it hard for her

638
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,080
 to actually worship God,

639
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,920
 because she's actually worshiping something else

640
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,640
 within her heart that she may or may not know.

641
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,920
 So it's really cool how Jesus actually calls this out

642
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,500
 and sets, and actually flashes this out

643
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,400
 before the discussion of worship begins,

644
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,160
 because it's hard to worship if you don't actually,

645
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,720
 you know, you're not worshiping him.

646
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,560
 You don't wanna worship something else within your heart.

647
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,080
 You're gonna say something, Emma?

648
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,920
 (laughing)

649
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,600
 - No, I was agreeing.

650
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,600
 No, I was reminded of what it was in Ezra

651
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,640
 when they came back from Babylon,

652
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,320
 and they were trying to rebuild the temple,

653
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,440
 and then the first thing that they built,

654
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,120
 they didn't build the outside of the temple.

655
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,480
 What they first built was the altar itself,

656
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,200
 because in the altar, that's where the sacrifice is made,

657
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,880
 and the slaughter of all the nasty things

658
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,880
 that, like, avoids us from connecting to God

659
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,440
 is taken away, right?

660
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,320
 Why do we not have the spirit?

661
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,320
 It's because the sin lives within us, well, in the past.

662
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,800
 (laughing)

663
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,640
 - But now we have it.

664
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,560
 - Yeah, but now we have the Holy Spirit, right?

665
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,560
 And the spirit, and our spirit, matches together, right?

666
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,560
 And then we get to worship the Lord, yeah.

667
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,040
 - I think it's neat that when you look at

668
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,320
 what your husband was saying around approaching Jesus,

669
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,600
 and it seems like there's a clarity that happens,

670
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,160
 and in that clarity of coming close to Jesus,

671
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,520
 the woman sees herself for who she truly is,

672
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,720
 and it's not like Jesus is dismissing her.

673
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,680
 I think it's good to make clear

674
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,200
 that even though he calls out the sin,

675
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,760
 he doesn't dismiss her, right?

676
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,280
 She's overjoyed, he calls out her sin,

677
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,800
 and she's like, "I see clearly.

678
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,440
 "Clearly, sir, you are a prophet."

679
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,480
 All of a sudden, everything kind of makes sense.

680
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,680
 Emma, you had a whole thing on, was it Isaiah,

681
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,520
 and what happens when you enter the presence?

682
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,560
 - Yeah, I was gonna say, so,

683
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,960
 the reason when we were discussing,

684
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,880
 I called repentance step zero,

685
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,480
 is 'cause I feel like it's a thing

686
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,040
 that often we're scared of.

687
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,520
 It sounds really like, oh no,

688
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,360
 all the bad things I've ever done are gonna be revealed.

689
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,720
 But actually, it's the first step,

690
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,120
 it's Jesus coming close, right?

691
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,040
 So conviction, the conviction of the spirit

692
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,920
 is equivalent to lighting.

693
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,720
 When you turn on a light to a room that's been dark,

694
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,400
 obviously you're gonna start to notice

695
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,240
 things in the room that are out of place.

696
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,880
 You're better than you would if it was dark, right?

697
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,440
 So if as people, we started to be a little bit less afraid

698
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,880
 of the concept of repentance and conviction,

699
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,460
 but noticing that God's nearness,

700
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,840
 because he is light, and in him no darkness dwells,

701
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,680
 his nearness will expose in us things that aren't

702
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,080
 to set them right.

703
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,600
 That's his intention, right?

704
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,000
 So we see it in Isaiah six, we see it in Luke five,

705
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,760
 where Isaiah sees the Lord.

706
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,840
 It says like, "On the day King Uzziah died,

707
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,960
 "I saw the Lord."

708
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
 And his first response after he sees the Lord,

709
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,080
 he sees God clearly, then he sees himself,

710
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,920
 and he's like, "Whoa, I'm a man of unclean lips,

711
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,120
 "and I'm gonna die."

712
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,580
 And then the next verse is God sending an angel

713
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,960
 to actually purify him.

714
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,660
 And then he can hear, and then there's prophecy,

715
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,840
 and then there's the rest of the 60 chapters

716
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,200
 of the book of Isaiah, right?

717
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,680
 Same, when Luke talks about how Peter meets Jesus,

718
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,600
 he meets Jesus, and once he notices and recognizes,

719
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,320
 "Oh, this is God," then he sees himself,

720
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,880
 and he's like, "Oh, get away from me.

721
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,000
 "I'm not clean," right?

722
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,880
 Our tendencies, it's to go,

723
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,980
 "If I realize I'm not actually as good as I was,

724
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,640
 "like I thought I was, oh no."

725
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,480
 And God is saying, "No, no, I'm coming near.

726
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,420
 "That's why you noticed this, but I want you closer.

727
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,020
 "So I'm revealing this so that you can have freedom.

728
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,200
 "Now you know that I know, I know that you know

729
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,400
 "that I know, and now you can worship me

730
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,600
 "without the baggage in between us."

731
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,960
 'Cause often a hindrance to worship is this idea

732
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,800
 that like, "Oh, if only he finds out what I had done,"

733
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,560
 or like, "Surely I can't be good enough."

734
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,160
 And it's like, it's okay, he sees you fully.

735
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,200
 And so allowing him as he convicts us,

736
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,600
 as we talked about a few weeks ago,

737
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,840
 that leads to his comfort, that leads to his nearness,

738
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,860
 that allows us freedom to actually know,

739
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,360
 "Oh yeah, he knows me."

740
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,240
 That's what the woman ends up telling them at the end,

741
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,880
 right, "Let me tell you about a man

742
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,600
 "who knows everything I've done," right?

743
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,440
 And there's still no distance.

744
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,420
 There is still no rejection.

745
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,860
 And this turns into an element of worship, right?

746
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,940
 And so the definition that we gave of worship

747
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,060
 being revelation and response,

748
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,060
 we're gonna do it backwards this time.

749
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,300
 That concept takes place again,

750
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,620
 not just in the Sunday gathering,

751
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,740
 but also outside of a Sunday.

752
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,980
 And so let's start with what happens outside of a Sunday.

753
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,920
 One of the reasons I had Akin join this panel

754
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,260
 was because he's the one person who, of the five of us,

755
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,740
 is not on the worship team, doesn't play any instruments

756
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,900
 to best my, is he a good singer?

757
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,180
 Okay, okay, okay, okay.

758
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,500
 So worship for him might look,

759
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,180
 it'll look like how it is for us, right?

760
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,700
 Like not all of us are on the stage,

761
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,620
 but we know Monday to Saturday

762
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,540
 are still opportunities for us to worship.

763
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,540
 So what does worship in a Monday to Saturday

764
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,220
 kind of situation look like for you?

765
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,780
 - No, I really appreciate the definition that Emma gave

766
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,260
 in terms of what worship is,

767
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,340
 because that is a pre-course of that,

768
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,160
 helps us understand that it's not just what we do

769
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,880
 on Sundays here, you know?

770
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,740
 We can respond to God, we can get revelations from God

771
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,540
 throughout the entire week.

772
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,380
 So yeah, like Kwame said, I'm not on the worship team.

773
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,600
 You probably don't want me to be on the worship team.

774
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,620
 I've been in sales and business development

775
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,660
 for the past 10 or so years of my life.

776
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,300
 And so yeah, most of what,

777
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,140
 most of the opportunities that I get to actually worship,

778
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,900
 they fall outside of this,

779
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,360
 unlike the rest of them who work with the church.

780
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,120
 I think one of the things that we hinted at earlier on

781
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,780
 is one of the things that's very important

782
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,820
 if you want to worship God the right way,

783
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,780
 even outside of here.

784
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,580
 So being able to just look at ourselves,

785
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,060
 like Emma said, that call to repentance,

786
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,840
 trying to, you know, there's no one who is perfect.

787
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,740
 Everyone has one or two things that they are going through,

788
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,540
 that they are struggling with.

789
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,020
 And we don't want this to hinder us

790
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,460
 from being able to worship God.

791
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,500
 So I think that's, it could be challenging,

792
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,660
 it could be difficult to look at the not so good looking

793
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,700
 parts within ourselves,

794
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,860
 but I think that's a very crucial part.

795
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,240
 That's a very crucial aspect of it.

796
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,180
 So that yes, we're able to see ourselves in relation,

797
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,000
 in relation to God.

798
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,700
 So we have a better idea of how we should actually respond

799
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,040
 to God.

800
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,020
 Being able to check your heart,

801
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,180
 for me to be able to check my heart,

802
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,100
 it helps me sort of figure out why I'm doing what I am doing

803
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
 because two people can do the same things

804
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,940
 for different reasons

805
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,620
 and God will judge them very differently

806
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,580
 'cause he looks at the heart.

807
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,340
 So like I mentioned, I'm in sales.

808
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,280
 One of the things that you would hear said

809
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,300
 if you're in sales is that the value ascribed to you

810
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,180
 is the money that you're able to make.

811
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,620
 That can be very pervasive, not only in sales,

812
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,660
 but in Hong Kong in general.

813
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,180
 There's this idea that we are judged

814
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,980
 based on our financial value

815
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,100
 and it's very real in my industry because that is my job.

816
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,020
 (laughing)

817
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,780
 That's exactly what I'm there to do.

818
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,540
 So me waking up in the morning, me going off to work,

819
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,740
 am I doing that because I've fallen into this lie

820
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,260
 where the only value that I have

821
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,380
 is because of the money that I'm able to make?

822
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,300
 Because in that case, I am not worshiping God.

823
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,900
 There is no truth to that.

824
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,420
 The Holy Spirit will not lead me to that.

825
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,640
 I can do the exact same thing,

826
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,540
 but understand that I'm doing it

827
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,480
 because it's an opportunity for me to worship God.

828
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,980
 It's an opportunity for me to use the talents

829
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,060
 and the skills that he has given me

830
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,660
 in a way that he actually wants me to.

831
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,060
 It is a blessing from God that,

832
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,780
 yes, he has helped me speak once in a while,

833
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,500
 but there's a story, there's a parable of the talents

834
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,420
 where God gives, the master gives talents to different people

835
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,820
 and he wants them to use it.

836
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,140
 He doesn't want them to just bury it within the sand.

837
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,160
 So yeah, being able to do that,

838
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,940
 that's a much better, yeah,

839
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,180
 going at it from that perspective

840
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,660
 is what I'm trying to say,

841
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,540
 much more easier to worship God

842
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,660
 as opposed to coming from a fearful

843
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,220
 or false value perspective.

844
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,820
 - Or you're gonna lose your job kind of perspective.

845
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,660
 - Yeah, exactly.

846
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,500
 - So I think really holding that place

847
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,140
 of the response in that situation

848
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,180
 is I'm responding to the call of God.

849
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,780
 I'm stewarding the resources that God has given me

850
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,980
 in a way that would make him proud.

851
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,380
 I'm maximizing my talents, I maximize my potential,

852
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,820
 not just for me, not because I'm afraid to get laid off,

853
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,520
 but because this is what God has given me

854
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,700
 and it's a call of excellence in that.

855
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,120
 It was really fun, like for me,

856
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,160
 a lot of times my worship is,

857
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,240
 if I'm leading worship, which is like once every six months,

858
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,860
 or if I'm on stage preaching,

859
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,040
 that could be a part of my worship.

860
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,200
 But we had an interesting encounter recently.

861
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,680
 Allison and I have been working with this guy

862
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,420
 who is dealing with, he's moved here,

863
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,120
 kind of gonna be a refugee and asylum seeker

864
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,760
 kind of seeking status from kind of

865
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,940
 some type of bad situation where he came from.

866
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,060
 And we're sitting with him and we don't have the answers.

867
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,700
 Like this is way above, like we're pastors, we can pray,

868
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,900
 but we don't know how to solve all these issues, right?

869
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,820
 And I just remember finding my heart,

870
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,300
 like at first I was a bit cold, if I'm being honest.

871
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,340
 I repented afterwards, but I was a bit cold

872
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,220
 'cause it was like, how do I know if your story's real?

873
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,300
 And how do I, we don't have all this money to give away,

874
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,220
 da da da da da.

875
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,600
 But as I sat there and I listened

876
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,860
 and I let God start to soften my heart,

877
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,300
 my heart changed a bit.

878
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,040
 And I recognized that by just spending time

879
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,080
 in the conversation, by engaging with him,

880
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,040
 even though I don't know him from anywhere,

881
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,800
 by listening, by finding ways,

882
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,640
 by finding unorthodox ways that we could help

883
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,700
 work with this guy.

884
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,200
 It was funny, I was telling one of you,

885
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,820
 I was like, I got the same chill bumps

886
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,660
 that you get in worship.

887
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,580
 Like I realized it was my worship for that day.

888
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,340
 Like that encounter, responding and bringing God's truth

889
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,260
 to that person and making time like Jesus would for them

890
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,440
 was my act of worship.

891
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,240
 And so worship does take place outside

892
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,060
 of the auditorium, outside of Sundays.

893
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,020
 But on Sundays, Jethro and Emma,

894
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,480
 I'd love to hear from you guys on how do you kind of

895
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,220
 balance this spirit and truth thing.

896
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,420
 If we're congregation members sitting here,

897
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,900
 getting ready to worship and sing songs,

898
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,060
 how do you kind of take spirit and truth

899
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,340
 into a worship setting, musically?

900
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,680
 - Well, one of the thoughts I had of reading this passage

901
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,580
 initially was when Jesus said, in truth,

902
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:17,580
 was also that in honesty and in integrity.

903
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,700
 And that's what God always speaks to me about,

904
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,360
 where if I come to worship,

905
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,640
 am I pretending to be someone else?

906
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,680
 Am I pretending to be perfect so that God accepts me?

907
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,120
 Or am I coming with all my pain and my struggle

908
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,340
 and my questions and I still come to worship on a Sunday

909
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,480
 because that's what God asked me to do.

910
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,220
 And I still lift my hands because that's what the Bible

911
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,180
 asked me to do, not because I'm feeling like it

912
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,780
 or I wanna be cool and whatever.

913
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,900
 - That's good.

914
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,280
 - So yeah, one worship leader said,

915
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,820
 when we're suffering on earth,

916
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,180
 that is an opportunity for us to give a sacrifice of praise

917
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,940
 because when we're in heaven, we don't have suffering.

918
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,780
 So in your suffering, in our suffering,

919
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,660
 when we come to worship him, do it out of a place of faith

920
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,220
 and not out of a place of feeling like it.

921
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,340
 - What about for you?

922
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,460
 When you come into this space,

923
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,620
 I mean, you lead worship like every single week.

924
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,820
 Like literally every week.

925
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,660
 You weren't supposed to lead worship,

926
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,060
 but I was supposed to lead worship.

927
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,860
 Okay, her birthday's next week,

928
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,720
 so she's taking some time off.

929
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,220
 But yeah, when you come into this space for worship,

930
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,620
 how do you wrestle with spirit and truth?

931
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,740
 Is it always easy to do both?

932
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,360
 Is there ever a tension?

933
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,500
 - It's definitely not easy.

934
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,620
 I think unless you were like, if this were a performance,

935
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,860
 then you could kind of shut off real life.

936
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,180
 But I'm reminded of the Psalm that says,

937
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,740
 "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me."

938
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,420
 And so that's how I come, with all that is within me.

939
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,820
 And I bring it before him,

940
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,160
 and I don't leave the crappy parts at the door.

941
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,000
 I bring it in.

942
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,420
 I said, "God, here are my questions, here are my doubts,

943
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,560
 "and here are the struggles I have with health,

944
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,680
 "here are the struggles I have with family."

945
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,340
 But you are faithful, that's true.

946
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,400
 Even if the facts of my life right now

947
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,700
 are rising against the knowledge of that,

948
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,520
 what will stand the test of time and eternity

949
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,880
 is who you say you are.

950
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,320
 So then it's like, I mean, I don't always feel like it.

951
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,520
 So sometimes I'm telling myself.

952
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,060
 I repeat things a lot, and you might think,

953
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,260
 like, oh, she's deep.

954
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,480
 I'm telling myself, he is good, he is faithful.

955
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,780
 And until my feelings catch up.

956
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,260
 Sometimes it takes a minute.

957
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,120
 Sometimes, if you've had a good week,

958
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,360
 your feelings are way ahead, and you gotta like, oh, okay.

959
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,760
 But a lot of, more often than not,

960
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,480
 it's just like being obedient to the call

961
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,360
 to praise the Lord.

962
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,480
 And I think it's one of the reasons I love

963
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,280
 the gathering of God's people,

964
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,940
 because when I don't have the strength,

965
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,560
 I come into the community of faith,

966
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,360
 and I'm honest with the community of faith.

967
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,680
 I'm like, I'm not, I'm not doing well, I haven't slept.

968
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,920
 And there have been so many Sundays

969
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,700
 where we're really held by the grace of God

970
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,680
 and the presence of people in the community

971
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,840
 that will check in, and we'll all just literally

972
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,080
 be interceding for one another.

973
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,640
 Everybody's like falling apart.

974
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,360
 But God is faithful.

975
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,240
 God is faithful.

976
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,760
 And I think that's real, that's real life, right?

977
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,840
 You're not always like, woohoo, I feel it.

978
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,200
 But reminding, training myself to recite truth

979
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,080
 so that when I don't, which is a lot,

980
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,800
 my confession is still truth.

981
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,380
 Until I remember, like, oh, right.

982
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,560
 So even when I don't feel it, you are good.

983
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,960
 - I mean, that's a good line.

984
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,360
 I think we wrote that one time.

985
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,680
 That's the perfect place to land, guys.

986
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,640
 Thank you for being a part of this.

987
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,120
 As the worship team gets back up on stage,

988
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,240
 I'm just gonna pray for us, but thank you, Jew,

989
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,400
 and thank you, Akin, for joining us in this space.

990
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,000
 Well, Church, if you'll go ahead and stand with me,

991
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,800
 we're gonna spend some time stepping back

992
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,400
 into this space of revelation and response.

993
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,500
 And I don't know where you are today,

994
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,340
 where you are this morning.

995
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,720
 Maybe it is hard for you.

996
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,160
 Maybe, like Emma said, maybe the facts of life

997
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,960
 are telling a different story,

998
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,880
 but when we worship in truth and we worship the truth,

999
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,920
 we know that he is good, that he is faithful.

1000
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,100
 And even if we don't see it yet, he remains true.

1001
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,040
 And we worship not just with our words,

1002
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,200
 not just with what we know,

1003
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,800
 but we allow the spirit that dwells within us

1004
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,120
 to speak to our spirits, to encourage our spirits,

1005
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,880
 to speak truth to our spirits.

1006
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,800
 There's been so many times that a certain lyric in a song

1007
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,280
 helps me actually get to the place of worshiping God

1008
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
 with my whole heart.

1009
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,240
 And so, Father, we come before you this morning

1010
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,800
 and we thank you that you've given us both,

1011
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,960
 that you've given us the truth in Jesus,

1012
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,200
 we've given us the truth in your word revealed.

1013
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,920
 You've also given us your spirit, a guide, a comfort,

1014
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,200
 someone that goes ahead of us,

1015
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,880
 someone that leads us to truth,

1016
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,680
 that brings things back to memory.

1017
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,160
 So as we sit in this moment, Holy Spirit,

1018
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,440
 would you begin to lead us to your truth?

1019
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,160
 Would you begin to push against the lies,

1020
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,800
 push against the false identities that are around,

1021
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,760
 against anything that would separate us

1022
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,000
 from being able to see you clearly

1023
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 and know that your love and that your mercies are abounding,

1024
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,320
 that you are good and that you are faithful and you are kind.

1025
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,240
 So we respond to you now in spirit to your truth.

1026
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,400
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

1027
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,000
 (gentle music)

1028
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,600
 (gentle music)

1029
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,200
 (gentle music)

1030
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,700
