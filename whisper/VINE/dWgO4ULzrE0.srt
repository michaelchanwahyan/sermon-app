1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
 by your word this afternoon.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,100
 In your name we pray, amen.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,100
 - Amen.

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,000
 Thank you, promise, for that, I think.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,660
 (congregation laughing)

6
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,060
 Good afternoon, church, how's everyone doing?

7
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,420
 Yeah, upper house, I see you.

8
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,260
 Actually, no, I don't see you, but I know you see me,

9
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,320
 so I wanna say hi.

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,220
 Hey, greetings, especially for those of you

11
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,260
 who just put up your hand,

12
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,920
 this is your first time at the Vine.

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,860
 Check out the newcomers, you get to meet us,

14
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,720
 some food, drinks.

15
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,020
 Just a little bit about myself.

16
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,960
 My name is Justin, one of the pastors here.

17
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,720
 I know we have many, but that is our Vine family.

18
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,820
 The Vine has been my home for almost two decades now.

19
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,600
 I've come to Hong Kong, I grew up in Canada,

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,020
 came to Hong Kong as a young adult, served here,

21
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,360
 got involved, got to know a bunch of people,

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,060
 met my wife here, got called to be a pastor

23
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,500
 and still walking this path now.

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,060
 And some of you actually recently asked me,

25
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,160
 you know, with all honesty,

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,860
 it's like, Justin, what do you do here?

27
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,200
 Let me answer that, I think this is a good time.

28
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,820
 I am Pastoral Care Pastor, what does that mean?

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,920
 Simply that when you email me, when you email us,

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,020
 I reply and together with the pastoral team,

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,400
 we find ways to support you, whether you're getting married,

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,960
 whether you want a visit, a prayer,

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,020
 that's why we're here for,

34
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,520
 so do reach out if you feel like that.

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,600
 Yeah, so we're almost through our series in this year.

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,660
 We're almost through our series in forgiveness.

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,000
 This is week five of six.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,700
 Pastor Ellison's gonna come back next week

39
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
 and wrap it all up.

40
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,300
 And so can I just see a show of hands,

41
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,600
 who's actually been here?

42
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,400
 Don't be shy, don't be shy, all right.

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
 So that's most of us actually.

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,900
 And so what have we talked about?

45
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,100
 We've talked about the importance of forgiveness,

46
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,300
 what it is and what it isn't,

47
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,900
 that we cannot forgive on our own strength.

48
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,700
 And of course, Christianity is the central tenet

49
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,600
 and one of the pillars of Christianity

50
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
 is that forgiveness renews us.

51
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,800
 Without forgiveness,

52
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
 Christianity would not make that much sense.

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,300
 Grace would not make that sense.

54
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,600
 And last week, Pastor Jennifer and Pastor Jess

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,100
 and Allison and Charles reminded us

56
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,900
 that we actually, a lot of times, many times,

57
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,900
 probably all the time, we need each other

58
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,100
 to help us on the journey of forgiveness.

59
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,700
 We need help, we need to be forgiven

60
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,300
 and we also need that encouragement

61
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,100
 to keep on walking this road.

62
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,500
 And church, I'm gonna,

63
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,000
 this is the most confident I'll be today

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,900
 and I can just probably read your mind and say,

65
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,900
 you know what, it has not been easy.

66
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,200
 This series has not been easy.

67
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,500
 Even preparing this message has been so difficult

68
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,000
 because forgiveness is a reality,

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,200
 it's a shared reality that all of us

70
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,500
 must diligently work through and work hard at.

71
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,700
 Forgiveness doesn't just come through a prayer or two,

72
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,200
 it doesn't come with just attending worship

73
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,800
 and God does something, it's a journey.

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 It takes hard work, it takes thoughtfulness,

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,800
 it takes our faith, it takes the community

76
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,900
 for us to walk through this.

77
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,300
 So I want to encourage you, you're not alone.

78
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,500
 We walk through it together.

79
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,200
 And so today, this week, week five,

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,100
 we want to explore what it means

81
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,400
 for us to receive forgiveness.

82
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,000
 So it really is about us today.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,400
 I wanna talk about you, I wanna talk about me

84
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,800
 and I want to invite you, wherever you are in this journey

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,000
 right now, forgiveness in your life, what season.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,900
 I want you to just be able to tangibly say,

87
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,400
 yes, this is what I'm gonna do about it.

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
 Now, I'm gonna take you through a journey,

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,200
 I'm gonna highlight three really complicated

90
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,200
 and difficult factor that causes us difficulty

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,500
 when it comes to receiving forgiveness for ourselves.

92
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,800
 And so I wanna ask you right now,

93
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,000
 what is your sermon strategy game?

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,600
 So I know I saw some eyebrows here.

95
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,600
 So when you come to church, how do you receive God's word?

96
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
 You know, do you take notes?

97
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,420
 Are you a note taker?

98
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,000
 I'm a note taker, I write everything

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,100
 that ever has been pre-preached.

100
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,000
 And I go home and I reflect on it and I pray about it.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,600
 Whereas some of us just listen and you absorb

102
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 and you're like, you know, this is what I need to do.

103
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,100
 And so I wanna encourage you, whatever your sermon game is,

104
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,600
 however you receive God's word,

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,100
 I've been just preparing this message for weeks.

106
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,600
 And my only prayer is that I believe

107
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,000
 that God's just gonna show us one thing.

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,500
 And I just pray that you would have the courage today

109
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,300
 to lean into this, to just say, yes, Lord,

110
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,200
 this is where I'm at, I'm not ashamed,

111
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,800
 I will not be ashamed, I'm just gonna act and respond.

112
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,300
 Okay, and so I want to just center our entire conversation

113
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,900
 in how to receive forgiveness for ourselves

114
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,900
 on this beautiful gospel story

115
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,100
 in Luke chapter seven, verse 36 to 50.

116
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,800
 So before I begin, I just wanna summarize.

117
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
 I think some of us appreciate summaries.

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,800
 This account is between Jesus and Simon the Pharisee.

119
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,100
 Simon the Pharisee invites Jesus to his house

120
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,600
 and there's always a surprise.

121
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,100
 This sinful woman comes unannounced

122
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
 because she desperately wants to see Jesus.

123
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,400
 This is where we're at.

124
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,200
 And so as we read this, as we listen to this passage,

125
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,300
 I just want you to consider one thing.

126
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,700
 I want you to think about why is it

127
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,900
 that some of us can love God more than others?

128
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,800
 You ready?

129
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,900
 All right, I'll take that as a yes.

130
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,400
 All right, so chapter seven, verse 36.

131
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,500
 When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus

132
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,900
 to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee's house

133
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,700
 and reclined at the table.

134
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,600
 A woman in that town who lived a sinful life,

135
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
 she was a prostitute, learned that Jesus

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,700
 was eating at the Pharisee's house.

137
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,800
 So she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,500
 As she stood behind him at his feet weeping,

139
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,500
 she began to wet his feet with her tears.

140
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,100
 Then she wiped them with her hair,

141
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,100
 kissed them and poured perfume on them.

142
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,800
 When the Pharisee, that is Simon,

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,500
 who had invited Jesus, saw this, he said to himself,

144
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,100
 "If this man were a prophet,

145
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
 "he would know exactly who is touching him

146
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,500
 "and what kind of woman she is, that she is a sinner."

147
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,800
 Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you.

148
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,300
 "Tell me, teacher," he said.

149
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
 "Two people owed money to a certain money lender.

150
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,900
 "One owed him 500 denarii and the other 50.

151
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,100
 "Neither of them had the money to pay him back,

152
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,000
 "so he forgave the debts of both.

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 "Now which of them will love him more?"

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,300
 Simon replied, "I suppose the one

155
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,000
 "who had the bigger debt forgiven.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,700
 "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.

157
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,000
 Then Jesus turned to the woman and also said to Simon,

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 "Do you see this woman, Simon?

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,500
 "I came into your house.

160
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 "You did not give me any water for my feet,

161
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,700
 "but she wet my feet with her tears

162
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,900
 "and wiped them with her hair.

163
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,000
 "You did not give me a kiss,

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,100
 "but this woman from the time I entered

165
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,300
 "has not stopped kissing my feet.

166
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,200
 "You did not put oil on my head,

167
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,700
 "but she has poured perfume on my feet.

168
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,800
 "Therefore, Simon, I tell you,

169
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,100
 "her many sins have been forgiven

170
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,600
 "as her great love has shown.

171
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,600
 "But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."

172
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,900
 Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."

173
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
 The other guests began to say amongst themselves,

174
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,300
 "Who is this who even forgives sins?"

175
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,100
 Jesus said to the woman,

176
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,800
 "Your faith has saved you.

177
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,300
 "Go in peace."

178
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,200
 When we read this, we can see that the response

179
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,700
 of Simon the Pharisee and the sinful woman

180
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,000
 cannot be any more different.

181
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,300
 And so the question I asked you was,

182
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,000
 how come some people can love God more than others?

183
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,400
 Well, I want to bring us back to verse 47,

184
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,700
 where Jesus says, "I tell you,

185
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
 "her many sins have been forgiven

186
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,300
 "as evidenced by the way she's loving.

187
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,800
 "But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."

188
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,300
 So for the woman, from the moment this woman

189
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,300
 came bursting into Simon's house uninvited, unashamed,

190
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,400
 her actions revealed that there is nothing

191
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
 too good for Jesus.

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,200
 How could she love?

193
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,300
 It's because she was grateful.

194
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,400
 She was indebted to Jesus,

195
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,700
 who was the one who forgave her for all her sins.

196
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,600
 Everything that she's done, Jesus forgave and said,

197
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,500
 "Go and live this new life in freedom away from sin."

198
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,600
 And so I think the critical difference

199
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,800
 was the woman was fully aware of her sinfulness

200
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
 and that she did something by coming to Jesus.

201
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,400
 And the way she acted is because she is so grateful.

202
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,100
 Now, by contrast, I think from our perspective,

203
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,500
 while Simon was cold, he's a bit rude,

204
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,400
 he was a bit disrespectful because he did not attend

205
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,700
 to the common courtesies that the Pharisees

206
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,100
 would have known to do, such as washing a guest's feet,

207
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,600
 such as greeting your guest with a kiss on the cheek,

208
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,400
 and also by anointing your guest's head with oil.

209
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,600
 And so I think Simon, he acted this way

210
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
 because he did not feel like he had

211
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,300
 to acknowledge his sinfulness,

212
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,400
 and that he probably did not comprehend the depth

213
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,500
 of God's forgiveness for this man.

214
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,600
 And so if I were to read this further together,

215
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,700
 can you imagine what if, what if in that moment,

216
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,700
 you know, Simon invites Jesus to his house,

217
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,300
 and suddenly Simon realized the depth of his depravity,

218
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,200
 his sinfulness, and he turned to Jesus,

219
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
 and he said, "Jesus, I want what she's having."

220
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,800
 Imagine if that's happened.

221
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,100
 That might have happened, but we don't know.

222
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,500
 And I think we can say that in this story,

223
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,800
 that forgiveness, being forgiven,

224
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
 and being able to receive that forgiveness

225
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,000
 has everything to do with how we love each other,

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,600
 how we forgive, and whether or not we will,

227
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,100
 are willing to extend forgiveness to one another.

228
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,600
 This story, when I was preparing,

229
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,700
 brought me back many, many years ago, when I was 16.

230
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,800
 I was running away from God.

231
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,400
 I knew God existed.

232
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,600
 I was a liar.

233
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,800
 I stole.

234
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,900
 I just wrecked all the relationships in my life

235
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,800
 to a point where luckily we moved houses twice,

236
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,300
 so I don't have to deal with the chaos I left.

237
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,900
 But when I think back, you know, when I was saved,

238
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,100
 God became everything.

239
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,900
 I was like that woman.

240
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,800
 I worshipped, I wept.

241
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,000
 I just did not care what people thought.

242
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 My friends and I, we just went to worship the Lord

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,400
 when we could have been doing other stuff.

244
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,300
 But then, of course, as we grow up, as I grew up,

245
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,500
 we encounter life, and life gets difficult.

246
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,400
 Things happen, our thoughts change, our values change,

247
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,600
 our belief change, they get challenged.

248
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,200
 And more and more, I hate to admit this,

249
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,000
 but sometimes I come to church,

250
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,300
 I come to worship the Lord

251
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,900
 with this Simon kind of attitude.

252
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,800
 I cross my arms sometimes.

253
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
 I'm a bit apathetic.

254
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,700
 My heart is cold.

255
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,100
 I'm forgetful at what God has done all of these years.

256
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,800
 He has never left me, but yet I just feel like,

257
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,400
 I don't feel much.

258
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,900
 And so therefore, I'm kind of like Simon,

259
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,500
 and I don't know if you can put yourselves in that,

260
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,400
 your shoes, and so I say all this

261
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,600
 because this story radically reframes

262
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,500
 the way we understand forgiveness.

263
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,000
 Because according to this story,

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,600
 if we want to receive forgiveness for ourselves,

265
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,100
 then it's going to require love.

266
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,800
 And we cannot understand and comprehend love

267
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,500
 until we understand how much we are forgiven.

268
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,000
 And so I want to just propose today

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
 that our starting point is that

270
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,300
 each of us have to think about

271
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,100
 our ability to receive forgiveness from God,

272
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,300
 our ability to receive forgiveness from each other,

273
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,700
 and I want to just highlight the three things

274
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,800
 that always gets in the way.

275
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,700
 I want to just bring them up to you

276
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,400
 so that all of us today will not shy away

277
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,900
 from critically analyzing and examining

278
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,500
 how are these three things affecting us right now.

279
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,600
 Because if we just don't do that,

280
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
 then we will get lost,

281
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 then we just kind of just get cold,

282
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,500
 we kind of end up like Simon a bit.

283
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,200
 And the three things I want to talk about

284
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,800
 is how our sin, our excuses, and our guilt

285
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,900
 impact and hinder our ability to receive forgiveness.

286
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,700
 So the first thing when we talk about our sins

287
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,100
 is that I just, you know, I want to say and state

288
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,300
 the obvious, that the reality is that all of us sin.

289
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,700
 Sin is the reality, the nature,

290
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,300
 our normal human everyday experience.

291
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,600
 We cannot separate ourselves from this reality.

292
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
 Isaiah 64 reminds us, verse four,

293
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,600
 "All of us have become like one who is unclean,

294
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,100
 "and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags,

295
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,900
 "and like the wind, our sin sweeps us away."

296
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,300
 The scripture says that as long as we are in

297
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,300
 this temporal, decaying body, sin will dwell in us,

298
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,000
 sin dwells in us, and that we will continue

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,400
 to commit inexcusable acts against God,

300
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,900
 against one another, against creation.

301
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,800
 And if we allow this sin to be unchecked,

302
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,600
 unrepented for, then we will experience

303
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,200
 dire and long-term consequences.

304
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,300
 And some of us have already experienced this.

305
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,200
 You know, sin disconnects us.

306
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,800
 Sin erects emotional barriers between us

307
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,500
 so that we cannot actually communicate, we cannot connect.

308
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,800
 Our sin causes us to act on our darkest, insatiable desires.

309
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,000
 It causes us to act out in our hatred,

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,300
 our jealousies, our self-righteousness.

311
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,000
 And if we allow sin to lead us,

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,700
 then we will continue to hurt and manipulate,

313
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,100
 control, abuse, and we will always seek retribution.

314
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,200
 But church, I want to, once again, just,

315
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,500
 I want to come back to the gospel.

316
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,000
 The good news is no matter how dark it gets,

317
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,400
 no matter how much sin controls us,

318
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,100
 the good news is that we are all, like this woman,

319
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,200
 equally placed to receive God's free

320
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,300
 and merciful grace in our life.

321
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,900
 That means all of us have the opportunity

322
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,400
 to be set free, to be forgiven,

323
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,500
 to be released on the potentiality

324
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,400
 to have a new life with Christ.

325
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,600
 And that's why he died for us,

326
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,300
 so that we can experience this.

327
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,400
 1 John 1, verse nine reminds us,

328
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,000
 I know we've read this in this series,

329
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 but this is such, this is a scripture that you should,

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,800
 and all of us should memorize.

331
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,400
 It says, "If we confess our sins,

332
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,700
 "God is faithful and just and will forgive us of our sins

333
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,700
 "and purify us from all unrighteousness."

334
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,300
 This means that as we confess,

335
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,000
 as we come to the Lord acknowledging our sinfulness,

336
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 the Holy Spirit will renew us, restore us, heal us.

337
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,200
 And this promise is as sure as the rising sun

338
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
 and the setting of the sun.

339
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,600
 However, this is conditional,

340
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,800
 depending on what we make of our sin,

341
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,300
 what we do with our sin.

342
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,700
 Because, church, once again, if we ignore the reality

343
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,400
 that sin is always against, working against us,

344
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,700
 and that sin dwells in us,

345
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,800
 then our lives will remain miserable,

346
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,600
 it will be burdensome, it will not be a pleasant journey.

347
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,400
 And all of us have experienced that.

348
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,100
 And our tendency to not adequately,

349
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,000
 as in to not honestly face and confront our sin reality

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 is probably the cause of a lot of my internal stress

351
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 and suffering, anxiety,

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,300
 and eventually, whatever happens in here,

353
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,900
 you will feel it, you will know it

354
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,800
 through my words and actions.

355
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,600
 And so, church, we ask, how should we respond then?

356
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,000
 I want to just say something very simple.

357
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,300
 I think we can respond by accepting our propensity to sin.

358
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,400
 Now, I'm not advocating an acceptance

359
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,200
 of our sinful lifestyle and that we continue in it.

360
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,600
 I'm saying that we should accept by examining

361
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,500
 and being honest to say, you know what?

362
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,200
 My sin has caused so much hurt

363
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,900
 and it continues to wreak havoc in these certain ways.

364
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,700
 And if we need further proof,

365
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,900
 our very attempt to avoid the reality

366
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,700
 and the consequences of our sin

367
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,400
 is actually symptom of our sinfulness.

368
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,700
 Because sin wants to keep us in the dark.

369
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,500
 It does not want our dirtiest deeds exposed.

370
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,800
 Sin also prevents us from seeing clearly.

371
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,100
 It distorts our vision.

372
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,300
 We do things out of ego, selfishness.

373
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,600
 I've already been in that.

374
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
 And sin keeps us from doing

375
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,400
 what we truly, genuinely want to do.

376
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,500
 And so, church, today, this afternoon,

377
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 if you are serious like me,

378
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,200
 that you want to follow Jesus for this rest of this life,

379
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,400
 you want to be faithful,

380
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,400
 then can I say to take your sin and our sin seriously

381
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,800
 and to take time and to examine

382
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,100
 how it is at work in our life?

383
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,200
 I would say that acceptance is the immediate

384
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,100
 and also long-term solution for us

385
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,500
 because as we journey, as we find comfort

386
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,200
 in the spirit and what God is doing,

387
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,500
 we encounter Jesus.

388
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
 And just like this woman,

389
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,300
 we meet Jesus and he forgives us.

390
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,700
 And we experience freedom.

391
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,200
 A second thing that hinders our ability,

392
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,300
 I think, to receive forgiveness,

393
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
 that we don't talk about enough,

394
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,000
 is our tendency to make excuses.

395
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,300
 As broken people, as sinful people,

396
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,200
 we cannot help but to habitually make excuses.

397
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,100
 We make excuses or we excuse ourselves

398
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,800
 out of doing something because, you know why?

399
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,600
 Because generally and probably most of the time,

400
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,200
 we're just afraid to face the truth.

401
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
 We are afraid to confront what we've done

402
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
 and how things really are.

403
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,500
 So what we do is we lie

404
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,100
 and we say deceptive things

405
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,300
 in order to make us feel better

406
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,000
 and to maintain this appearance

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,800
 of being good, moral people.

408
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,700
 Sometimes we run away.

409
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,200
 Sometimes we take substances to numb ourselves

410
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,500
 so that we can ignore what is actually happening.

411
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,000
 And so this, our incredible ability

412
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,200
 to excuse ourselves from wrongdoing

413
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,200
 is gets perpetuated by rationalizing, by blaming,

414
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,500
 by trying to put together obsessively the perfect excuse

415
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,800
 so that we don't have to deal with God,

416
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,100
 so I don't have to say sorry to you.

417
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,500
 When I think about Simon's distancedness

418
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,900
 when the day that Jesus visited him,

419
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,200
 I think that Simon must have told himself certain excuses.

420
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,900
 He must have rationalized where he stood,

421
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,400
 you know, because he was a Pharisee,

422
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,100
 so he knew and he probably said to himself,

423
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,600
 "Well, I'm religious.

424
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,200
 "I attend to the temple, I teach, I tithe,

425
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,700
 "I do everything I'm supposed to.

426
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,400
 "I have memorized the Torah."

427
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,600
 You can ask my colleagues here.

428
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 They know me.

429
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,500
 And if Simon kept on saying that

430
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700
 and carrying with that narrative,

431
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,800
 then there's actually nothing for him to repent of.

432
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,700
 He has done no wrongdoing.

433
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,800
 And I think this, in Simon,

434
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,300
 I think there is a cautionary lesson here

435
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,100
 that as Christians, it's really easy for us

436
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,500
 to come here on a Sunday

437
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,300
 and never have to actually deal with our sin

438
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,400
 because we're very vague about our sin.

439
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,700
 You know, we're very general.

440
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,400
 We're not actually trying to specifically call out

441
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
 how we've hurt each other.

442
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,300
 And so we can come here and just say,

443
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,000
 "I'm sorry, God," but we go away just deceived

444
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,500
 because we actually haven't asked for forgiveness.

445
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,200
 We actually haven't rectified our wrong.

446
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,600
 And so how should we respond to our excuses?

447
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,200
 Well, I'm gonna quote the great C.S. Lewis

448
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,800
 because he offers a little bit,

449
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,000
 well, not a little bit, but very helpful thoughts

450
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,300
 on how we can counter our excuse-making.

451
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,100
 The first thing C.S. Lewis would call us to do

452
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,600
 is to remember that God knows of all our actual excuses

453
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,900
 even before we say it.

454
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,900
 You know, because if Jesus was the one

455
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,600
 that died in our place on the cross,

456
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,300
 he died for our sins and our excuses

457
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,700
 and everything that causes us to be disconnected

458
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,400
 so that we can be forgiven,

459
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,100
 so that we are not condemned for the same thing.

460
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
 I think this is why the sinful woman

461
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,700
 was able to run to Jesus because she knew

462
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,800
 that she would be free if she came to him.

463
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,200
 And I think the surest way,

464
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,800
 another way that C.S. Lewis would call us

465
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,900
 to counter our excuse-making is to simply believe

466
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,600
 that Jesus is willing and wanting to forgive us.

467
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,100
 You know, after years of making excuses,

468
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
 after years of making excuses,

469
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,900
 of living in these false narratives

470
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,600
 because we just don't wanna deal with the pain

471
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,300
 and we don't want the suffering,

472
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,600
 we'd rather just run away,

473
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,400
 we start believing the very things that we say.

474
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,900
 And the incessant anxiety to make excuses

475
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,800
 eventually causes us to believe a false gospel.

476
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,300
 It starts making us believe that God will not forgive us.

477
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,100
 But today, the good news, based on Luke 7,

478
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,800
 we realize and you realize,

479
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,300
 I want you to know that if you come to God today

480
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,700
 and ask for forgiveness, you know he will say,

481
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,300
 "I will, I will forgive you, I will set you free."

482
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:58,000
 And the third factor, the third thing I want us to address

483
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,900
 that is a bit more complex, a bit more difficult

484
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,600
 is to talk about our guilt.

485
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,000
 You know, to what extent does our guilt

486
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,300
 hinder our ability to receive forgiveness?

487
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,100
 You know, because I think all of us can agree

488
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,800
 that there are so many moments in life

489
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,900
 when we are overwhelmed by our guilt

490
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,500
 because of what we've done, what we continue to do,

491
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,300
 even though we try to stop, what we've done in secret,

492
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,400
 when we told ourselves we need to stop doing this,

493
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,300
 and all the ways that we've hurt people

494
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,400
 and we've left just bodies behind us

495
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,500
 but we don't wanna deal with it.

496
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,500
 And that guilt, if we don't look at it honestly,

497
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,300
 it turns into shame, it turns into stress,

498
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
 it turns into fear, it turns,

499
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,500
 it just causes us to want to hide.

500
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
 And then we spiral into this place

501
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,700
 where we eventually start believing that,

502
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,200
 you know what, I'm so unworthy, I am unlovable,

503
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,700
 I'm actually unforgivable.

504
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,200
 And we live like that, I think a lot of us

505
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,400
 just live like that.

506
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,100
 You know, think about Simon, Simon invites,

507
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,400
 he had perfect intention to invite Jesus to his house,

508
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,300
 and what happens, Jesus is like, Simon,

509
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,500
 you didn't do this, you didn't do this,

510
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,900
 you didn't do this, imagine the guilt

511
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,300
 that the guy would have felt, and maybe that's why

512
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,200
 he couldn't say anything else, he didn't know what to say,

513
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
 he was just stuck.

514
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,600
 And you know that as hard as we've tried,

515
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,900
 we've probably come to the same conclusion.

516
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,700
 We've tried to get rid of our guilt,

517
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,100
 but we realize we don't have the power,

518
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,000
 we don't have the authority to forgive ourselves

519
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,900
 or to release ourselves from our guilt,

520
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,300
 otherwise there would be no need for Jesus to die for us.

521
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,600
 But equally true, we've also, I think, realized

522
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,500
 that we cannot mitigate or lessen or get rid of our guilt

523
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,400
 by just being more disciplined, more balanced,

524
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,500
 by our own effort and strength and willing

525
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,000
 that the guilt goes away.

526
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,700
 And so Paul omits exactly the state we're in,

527
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,800
 he says, what a wretch, what a wretch we are.

528
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,400
 We are consumed and overwhelmed by this sin and guilt

529
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
 and who can rescue us?

530
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,500
 And so perhaps of just thinking about,

531
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,800
 well, how do I get rid of this guilt, Justin?

532
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,400
 I want us to maybe think about it

533
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,500
 as how do we work at our guilt?

534
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,100
 How do we take steps towards God where we say

535
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,500
 this is the guilt we have now,

536
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,300
 Lord, can you help me deal with this?

537
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,200
 Walk with me, teach me how to let this go

538
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,300
 so I'm not led astray by my own guilt

539
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,900
 and all these feelings having to do with it.

540
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,500
 And so I think how we can respond is we start in Romans 8.1

541
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,000
 and Paul says, there is therefore no condemnation

542
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,500
 to those who are in Christ Jesus.

543
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,700
 This scripture reminds us of the gospel once again

544
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,900
 that we are no longer condemned

545
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,100
 because of what Jesus did on the cross.

546
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,600
 Because he died for us,

547
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,800
 he did something that we can never do for ourselves.

548
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,900
 And so that Jesus died the most gruesome

549
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,800
 and violent, unspeakable death as the only son of God

550
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,400
 in our place so that we can know what freedom from guilt is

551
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,700
 so that we can live on the resurrected side of the cross.

552
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,800
 And each time we confess our sins to God,

553
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,600
 he doesn't condemn us but he gives us the Holy Spirit

554
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,200
 and through the Holy Spirit, we are renewed,

555
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,300
 we are set free.

556
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,900
 And so this sinful woman could approach Jesus

557
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,400
 because despite everything that she's done,

558
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,200
 all the shameful things that she does not want to say,

559
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
 she knew that she didn't have to hold up any excuses

560
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,900
 and that for all the guilt and shame,

561
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,100
 she knew that Jesus would forgive her.

562
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,300
 And she came boldly because of that.

563
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:53,500
 And so church, I want to raise and propose a question

564
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,400
 that I think for the rest of our life, we should wrestle with

565
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,500
 that we should be aware and should be asking ourselves

566
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,400
 concerning guilt.

567
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,700
 And this question is super important

568
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,300
 because this question is,

569
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,400
 is the guilt that you feel right now

570
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,600
 a conviction of the Holy Spirit

571
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,900
 or is the guilt and the condemnation you feel

572
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,200
 something that the devil is causing you to feel on purpose?

573
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,200
 Because sometimes if we don't think about this,

574
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,600
 if we allot everything to God and what he's doing,

575
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,600
 when bad things happen, we think that this is God leading us

576
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,000
 because there's no other option.

577
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,800
 But actually there is another option.

578
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,300
 There's another realities that we live in this world

579
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,800
 where Satan is the prince

580
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,300
 and that he does influence many things.

581
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,900
 And so we cannot be naive about this.

582
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,100
 We cannot be ignorant.

583
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,100
 And I think guilt is such a practical real entry point

584
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,700
 to understanding is God's truth and what he's saying.

585
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,500
 Do I believe that?

586
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,300
 Or will I allow myself to just be swept away

587
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
 by what the enemy is doing?

588
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,700
 He wants to keep us in the dark.

589
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,600
 He wants us to just continue to be condemned

590
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,300
 and live in darkness.

591
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,300
 And so how do we discern this?

592
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,000
 Today I want to just propose one thing.

593
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,800
 I want to invite you to allow the Spirit

594
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,300
 to open up your heart, open up my heart

595
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,600
 to show us what is true

596
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,100
 so that we can authentically seek change.

597
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,800
 Because in all these years, we've lived with our excuses.

598
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,900
 We've lived with sin.

599
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,800
 It's like living without an arm,

600
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,600
 living without a feet, living with this like ugly wound.

601
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,300
 This is how a lot of us have been living.

602
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,900
 But we don't have to live like this.

603
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,700
 And today I want to share the good news

604
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,500
 that perhaps guilt could be a gift of God to us

605
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,100
 if we allow it.

606
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,800
 Because through guilt,

607
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,600
 we can journey into an awakened state

608
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,700
 where we realize I don't have to live in sin.

609
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,100
 I don't have to keep on giving excuses

610
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,500
 and to pretend that my life is perfect when it's not.

611
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:02,900
 And so guilt has the potential to bring us closer to God,

612
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,500
 to experience his kindness and his mercy.

613
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,300
 And guilt makes us aware of what we actually need

614
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,000
 to be forgiven for rather than what we think we need.

615
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,300
 And finally, guilt is a gift that enables us

616
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,700
 to know and experience God's so amazing grace

617
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
 because he knows how much we need it.

618
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,300
 So now let me just tie everything together so far, okay?

619
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,300
 If I were to propose an idea that encapsulates

620
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:38,000
 how we can counter our sin, our excuses, our guilt

621
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,500
 in one practice that the church has been called to practice

622
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,800
 through the generations,

623
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,300
 it would be the practice of confession.

624
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,500
 And I'll be the first to admit that I think as a church,

625
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,900
 we don't talk about confession as much.

626
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:58,800
 I grew up with confession 'cause the people around me,

627
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,900
 we just knew the importance of it.

628
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,700
 And so I remember it and I want us to remember it.

629
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,800
 I want us to know about confession

630
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
 because it's a matter of life and death.

631
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,200
 You know, I don't know if you follow church news,

632
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,000
 but in recent years, there's just been so many scandals

633
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,100
 involving Christians, pastors, people we respect

634
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,500
 and followed for many years.

635
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,900
 And I just think, I was thinking this week that,

636
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,600
 you know, what if these pastors

637
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,400
 in the community practiced confession?

638
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,500
 Then maybe these churches and these communities

639
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,100
 could have mitigated just the chaos,

640
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,800
 the internal inside secret chaos that we all carry.

641
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,100
 We could have mitigated that

642
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,700
 and we could just avoid all these news scandals.

643
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,100
 And I want you to remember this verse.

644
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,300
 I think this is one of those verses, once again,

645
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,800
 I've just committed to my memory.

646
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,600
 It's James 5, verse 16.

647
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,900
 And I want you to hear this in this context

648
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,300
 of what we're talking about.

649
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,400
 If you're serious about wanting to be free,

650
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,900
 wanting to be able to receive forgiveness

651
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,400
 and to be able to love again freely and unashamedly,

652
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,500
 then listen to James.

653
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,800
 James says, "Therefore, confess your sins to each other

654
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,800
 "and pray for one another so that you may be healed."

655
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,300
 See, confession is God's idea.

656
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,600
 Confession is God's way of not allowing the church

657
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,300
 to be sucked and destroyed by sin.

658
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,500
 Confession is a way in which we can bring our sin,

659
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,200
 our guilt, whatever it is,

660
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,000
 that keeps us from being forgiven,

661
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,900
 that keeps us from God into the light

662
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,800
 so that there's no more excuses.

663
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,700
 And that we would, in confession,

664
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,500
 see things for what they really are and not be ashamed,

665
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,100
 but knowing that God forgives us.

666
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,000
 And so I think how James and how confession is practiced

667
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,600
 is that we are to go to one another

668
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,300
 because as brothers and sisters in Christ,

669
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,900
 we represent Christ to each other.

670
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,100
 We represent Christ and light and salt to the world, right?

671
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,200
 So in confession, we just go up to someone

672
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
 and we say, "Hey, I wanna be frank with you about my sin.

673
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,100
 I wanna be frank about my excuses.

674
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,200
 I wanna tell you how my shame and guilt

675
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,400
 has been at work in me."

676
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,800
 And James says, "We then, rather than just judge

677
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,000
 and just be in shock, we pray for another."

678
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,600
 And can I say what I'm about to say,

679
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,200
 this is what defines Christianity.

680
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,800
 When you confess and you pray for another

681
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,000
 and you know that God is in that conversation,

682
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,700
 the miraculous happens.

683
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,300
 You get freed, you experience God's grace

684
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,200
 and there's no theology.

685
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,800
 I don't have words to explain that moment.

686
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,100
 But all I can say is that as Christians,

687
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,300
 if we do not confess our sins, if we do not repent,

688
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,500
 if we do not ask for forgiveness, then we do not grow.

689
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,700
 Because forgiveness and asking for forgiveness,

690
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,000
 confession is a discipleship issue.

691
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,600
 If Jesus says it's important,

692
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,600
 then I think we should take that a bit more seriously.

693
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,600
 (sips tea)

694
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,500
 I just want to maybe share a little bit.

695
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,900
 You know, I have three beautiful children,

696
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,200
 two are here right now.

697
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,200
 And I think since having these three children,

698
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
 I've learned something about myself.

699
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,400
 I've learned that I have road rage

700
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,800
 even when I'm not driving.

701
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,200
 And it sucks, it really is terrible, you know?

702
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,100
 And I think, unfortunately, fortunately,

703
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,900
 my wife, my helper, my three children

704
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,000
 are the ones that actually see this part of me.

705
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,900
 And the hardest part, I think, every day, every week,

706
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,000
 every month is to have the courage to say sorry.

707
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,600
 It's to have the courage to apologize

708
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,700
 for what I've done wrong.

709
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,900
 You know, of course, before I get to that point,

710
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,600
 there's a lot of excuses, there's a lot of excusing,

711
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,900
 there's a lot of guilt, a lot of just fantasizing,

712
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,500
 what if, you know, the first worst case scenario is

713
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,400
 what if my children don't forgive me?

714
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,400
 You know, but you know what causes me to do this,

715
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,900
 to ask for their forgiveness?

716
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,800
 It's that I cannot move on otherwise.

717
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,700
 I can't live my life, I cannot continue another day

718
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
 knowing that we are disconnected,

719
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,900
 knowing that my sin, my excusing, my guilt, my shame,

720
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,400
 my acting out is causing us to have,

721
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,600
 keeping us from having a good relationship,

722
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,900
 a healthy relationship.

723
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,000
 And so it's the possibility,

724
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,100
 even the slightest possibility of shalom,

725
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,600
 of reconciliation that I say, you know what, screw it,

726
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 I'm gonna run to Christ, I'm gonna do this.

727
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:56,500
 I wanna quote what my wife said recently.

728
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,300
 It's just a truth bomb, she didn't realize she said this.

729
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,000
 We were teaching marriage prep together

730
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,200
 and we were, week four, the last week,

731
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,800
 we talked about the importance of forgiveness

732
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,600
 and working out all our stuff.

733
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,400
 And she said this, she said,

734
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,400
 "Even if things are dead inside, forgiveness revives them."

735
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,100
 And I think you can replace forgiveness

736
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,800
 with repentance, confession, asking for forgiveness,

737
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,900
 extending forgiveness.

738
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,900
 And the reality is, just like the sinful woman,

739
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,100
 I want us to come back to her

740
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,800
 because she models what all of us need.

741
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,900
 We need an openness, a belief,

742
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,500
 a genuine belief that God will forgive us.

743
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,600
 And we need to know in faith that when we go,

744
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,000
 that he will free us and liberate us

745
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,800
 like nothing we've ever experienced.

746
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,600
 And this is the mystery of our Christian faith.

747
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
 This is the grace of our Christian faith.

748
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,300
 And this is why to this day,

749
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,000
 as hard as it is to be a Christian,

750
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,700
 I'm still a Christian because I've experienced

751
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,900
 God's grace coming through confession,

752
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,900
 through asking for forgiveness and being forgiven.

753
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,900
 I don't know if you can recall the last time

754
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,700
 you were forgiven for something.

755
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
 You know, that just sets you free.

756
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,300
 It causes, you're just lighter.

757
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,000
 And I know I said, I can't really explain in theology

758
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,800
 and words what that feeling is like, but let me try.

759
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,900
 So when you confess, when you ask for forgiveness,

760
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,700
 when someone forgives you,

761
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,900
 it is just the most surprising feeling.

762
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,300
 You're like, what?

763
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,100
 What?

764
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,900
 What?

765
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,600
 And you experience this unconventional release and relief

766
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,100
 that you're like, wow,

767
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,400
 that you just cannot anticipate until it happens,

768
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,100
 until in that moment someone says you're forgiven,

769
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
 until you feel like the Spirit just released you

770
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,600
 of many years of guilt.

771
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,200
 And you will never regret this decision.

772
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,000
 To confess and to receive forgiveness

773
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,300
 is like having the pain of a toothache suddenly gone

774
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,800
 because the dentist has removed that tooth.

775
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,200
 And you feel that gap of openness.

776
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,000
 And when you eat ice cream, you feel the chilling numbness

777
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,600
 and you're so glad that it's not pain.

778
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,500
 It feels unfamiliar because this world tells us

779
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
 that you should not forgive.

780
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,700
 Eye for an eye, right?

781
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,200
 Our love, our relation is conditional.

782
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,500
 If you treat me well, I'll treat you well.

783
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,900
 But actually that is not what Jesus came to teach us.

784
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,800
 He taught us the very opposite.

785
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,100
 He said to take a risk.

786
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,500
 He says to trust me, to lean into me,

787
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,400
 and I will teach you how to live this life

788
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:42,600
 with a yoke that is light, that is not burdensome.

789
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,400
 And so I just pray, church,

790
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,000
 that you would be willing to give this a try

791
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,800
 because if you do not,

792
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,900
 we lose out on an opportunity of growth.

793
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:59,400
 Worship team, can I invite you up?

794
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,300
 I want to conclude, church, to remind us

795
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,000
 that the journey of forgiveness,

796
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,700
 the journey of the Christian faith,

797
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,500
 it is a long journey.

798
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,700
 It is an ongoing journey.

799
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,700
 It is actually a marathon.

800
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,100
 But what keeps us running is that whenever we fall,

801
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,800
 whenever we get tired,

802
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,100
 whenever we need some kind of encouragement,

803
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,500
 Christ meets us through the church.

804
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,300
 And therefore we can get healing.

805
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,900
 We can ask for forgiveness.

806
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,100
 We can be encouraged.

807
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,600
 The Spirit fills us up.

808
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,400
 The Word of God encourage us, and we keep on going.

809
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,600
 And so, church, I, you know,

810
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,100
 sometimes I think, well, what do I want to do with my life?

811
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,000
 My simple answer is I just want to finish well.

812
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,300
 I want to be faithful to Jesus.

813
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,600
 I want to serve the church as I can.

814
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,200
 But I want to be faithful.

815
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,000
 And so, church, I want to remind us

816
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,400
 that if you are serious about being a Christian,

817
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,200
 then just, you have to be patient,

818
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,400
 as God is patient to us,

819
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,900
 because growth and clarity comes in time.

820
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,300
 It doesn't come right away.

821
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,800
 And, church, I just, lastly, just want us to remember

822
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,800
 the difference of the sinful woman and Simon the Pharisee

823
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,400
 and how they responded.

824
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,300
 Because the woman was able to accept her sinful life.

825
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,000
 She was able to repent, and as a result,

826
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,900
 she was just set free.

827
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,700
 She was so grateful that she was forgiven

828
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,400
 that she decided that wherever Jesus is,

829
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,800
 I'm going to be there.

830
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,900
 I'm going to anoint his feet.

831
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,600
 I'm going to weep.

832
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,500
 I'm going to worship him.

833
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,200
 I'm going to give the best of what I have to Jesus

834
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,900
 because she is so grateful.

835
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,000
 And therefore, she can love.

836
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,600
 Now, Simon, I think at that point in this story,

837
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,300
 he remained in a bit of darkness.

838
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,100
 He wasn't fully able to live the life fully

839
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,200
 because maybe, perhaps, of his understanding of his sin,

840
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,700
 and he didn't understand how much God yearns to forgive him.

841
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:04,700
 And so I pray, church, I want to ask you to stand.

842
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,800
 I'm going to come back to that prayer I shared with you.

843
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,500
 My only prayer for you today, this afternoon,

844
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,600
 is that you would have courage to come to Jesus this afternoon,

845
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,000
 just like this woman,

846
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,400
 that you would seek to be released and forgiven from your sin,

847
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,700
 that you can just say, "Lord, I don't have any more excuses.

848
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,600
 I don't need excuses because I'm with you."

849
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,500
 And would you say, "Lord, Holy Spirit,

850
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,900
 would you help me to work at this guilt by confession?

851
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,100
 Would you help me to just lighten this load I've been carrying?

852
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,600
 Would you give me an opportunity to say sorry,

853
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,800
 to rectify, to go to someone who I've hurt,

854
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,400
 and just start this conversation of reconciliation?"

855
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,600
 Whatever it is, church, I just want to invite you and to imagine.

856
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:12,200
 I want you to just imagine the Jesus that this woman poured her tears upon,

857
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,100
 this Jesus that no longer condemns her,

858
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:23,000
 this Jesus that set her free and said, "Go and live this new life."

859
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,900
 I want you to come to this Jesus this afternoon.

860
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,800
 I want you to consider just that one thing the Spirit is showing you right now,

861
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:40,400
 so that you can just say, "Lord, help me to see this from your perspective."

862
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,900
 Or maybe some of us, we just need to respond in adoration today

863
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:51,600
 because you recognize how much you've been forgiven.

864
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,700
 And so, church, would you go out and encourage?

865
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,000
 Would you worship with your heart?

866
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Would you continue just to be steadfast and say, "I'm in it to win this marathon"?

867
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,100
 So, Jesus, would you walk and run with us, we pray?

868
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,000
 Amen. Let's worship, church.

869
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
