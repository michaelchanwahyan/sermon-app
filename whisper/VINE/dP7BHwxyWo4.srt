1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,500
 Amen.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,960
 - Amen.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,620
 Well, before I start, there is one more thing

5
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,080
 that Jess forgot to share.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,200
 During her time away, she came back quite different,

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,800
 actually, Jess came back as an engaged woman.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,080
 (audience cheering)

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,920
 Yay!

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,160
 So congratulations to Jess.

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,640
 Yeah, there she is.

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,260
 Whoa, yeah, there it is, look at it.

13
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,100
 Ah!

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,160
 (audience cheering)

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,000
 So shiny.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,960
 (audience applauding)

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,000
 So big congratulations to Jess and Ken.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,840
 We look forward to welcoming him to our community soon.

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,880
 He's moving here, right?

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,800
 Yeah, you did it right.

21
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,640
 Good.

22
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,480
 (audience laughing)

23
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,300
 Good.

24
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,720
 Well, good morning, church,

25
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,640
 and if you're joining us online and overflow,

26
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
 good morning to you as well.

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,840
 I'm gonna have a question.

28
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,760
 When you daydream, what do you dream about?

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,960
 Like when you're sitting at your desk pretending to work,

30
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,560
 you know, and like you're staring at the screen,

31
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,200
 but really your mind's somewhere else.

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,360
 What are some things that you find yourself thinking about?

33
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,160
 You know, imaginations,

34
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,280
 things that you wish would happen to you.

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,120
 Okay, I'm about to give you a little bit more insight

36
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,480
 into the strange and wonderful mind of Alison.

37
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,320
 Okay, I'm only doing this 'cause this is a safe place,

38
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,680
 I hope, all right?

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,280
 And if you didn't already think I was weird,

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,620
 maybe now you'll know.

41
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,000
 Most of my daydreams involve some sort of

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,480
 breaking out of obscurity and into the limelight, right?

43
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,760
 It's kind of weird, okay?

44
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,960
 And for example, I used to do a lot of running,

45
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,720
 so I used to imagine myself

46
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,040
 like running the Hong Kong marathon, okay?

47
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,680
 And then, you know, I'm running the Hong Kong marathon,

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
 I'm running, and suddenly, right, I break through the pack,

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,520
 and then on TV it's like, "Whoa, who is this guy?

50
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,880
 "He's so super fast!"

51
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,320
 You know, I'm like leading the race,

52
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,440
 and I set a world record pace, right?

53
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,240
 And everyone's like, "Whoa, out of nowhere

54
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,200
 "comes this guy, his name's Alison," right?

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,440
 And he's such an amazing runner, something like that.

56
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,200
 Or maybe I'm at a concert, you know,

57
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,200
 we're at a John Legend concert, right?

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,640
 And then he's playing on the piano,

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,880
 and suddenly he's lost his voice, and he falls sick,

60
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,360
 and he's like, "I'm gonna need someone

61
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,760
 "to close out the show."

62
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,960
 Okay, it's like, "You, sir,

63
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,520
 "you look like you're a good singer."

64
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,000
 Okay, "Say less, John Legend!"

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,420
 Okay, and I get on the piano, and I start playing,

66
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,880
 I don't even play the piano, right?

67
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
 And then everyone's like, "Whoa, wow,

68
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,460
 "this guy's even better, right?

69
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,600
 "Like, our ticket was well worth the money,"

70
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,120
 something like that, okay?

71
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,040
 Okay, last one, okay, promise you.

72
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,560
 Right, I'm walking down the road, right,

73
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,880
 and suddenly I come across a dangerous situation, right?

74
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,960
 And there's these bad guys

75
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,880
 that have kidnapped a bunch of children.

76
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,720
 And I happen to be in the right place at the right time,

77
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,760
 and because I've been training martial arts

78
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,000
 and hand-to-hand combat secretly, right,

79
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,840
 like Liam Neeson in "Taken," I say to them,

80
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,440
 "I have a very particular set of skills,

81
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,280
 "skills I've acquired over a very long career,

82
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,100
 "skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.

83
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,040
 "Let these kids go now, and that'll be the end of it.

84
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,520
 "But if you don't, I will find you,

85
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,760
 "and I will kill you," right?

86
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,800
 And then, like, you know, I go,

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,960
 and I take down all the bad guys and save the day,

88
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,300
 and I was like, "Yeah, what a hero, okay?

89
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,240
 "Pray for me," right?

90
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,240
 These are just things that go through my mind

91
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,340
 when I'm wondering.

92
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,400
 We come to the story of Elijah today

93
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,120
 in our "Encounter with God" series.

94
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,440
 And the reason I told you those things

95
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,560
 is because this is sort of how Elijah burst onto the scene.

96
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,400
 You know, he is a man sort of appearing out of obscurity,

97
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
 appearing out of nowhere.

98
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,120
 We're not really given much about his background

99
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,120
 or who he is, but it's not long before we find out

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,120
 that this isn't just any old person or any normal prophet.

101
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,940
 And we find that Elijah is a guy

102
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,800
 that you really don't wanna mess with.

103
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,360
 No, he's not perfect, but he is a powerful prophet,

104
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,360
 able to do amazing things, a force to be reckoned with.

105
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,800
 But it's not because he has any sort of special skills

106
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,920
 or he's particularly intimidating or anything like that,

107
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,320
 but rather it's because God is working through him.

108
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,280
 It's because he has these amazing encounters with God

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
 and God keeps speaking to him, working through him.

110
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,440
 And through these encounters,

111
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,700
 he hears and obeys what God calls him to do.

112
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,840
 And then throughout history, Elijah,

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,800
 especially for the Jewish people,

114
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,440
 Elijah is regarded as one of the greatest prophets

115
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,040
 of all time.

116
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,600
 And today he is still honored and revered and respected.

117
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,360
 In Jewish culture, during the Passover meal,

118
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,920
 the door is left open at one stage

119
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,800
 in anticipation that perhaps Elijah would return.

120
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,200
 He is the most mentioned prophet in the New Testament.

121
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,360
 In fact, Elijah was so amazing, he was so great

122
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,360
 that he didn't, one of the few people,

123
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,080
 one of two people in scripture,

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,480
 maybe even in all history, that didn't experience death.

125
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,140
 He was taken up to heaven in chariots of fire,

126
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,200
 never having experienced what it means to die.

127
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,560
 So today, as we look at Elijah,

128
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,880
 we're gonna look at a few ways

129
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,840
 that this prophet encountered God.

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,720
 How it shaped him, how it molded him,

131
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,620
 how it equipped him to do what God had called him to do

132
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,240
 and what this means for us today

133
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,360
 as followers of Jesus in today's age.

134
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,080
 So we're gonna look at the Bible and see what it has to say.

135
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,320
 1 Kings 17, one.

136
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,980
 Again, this is all we know about Elijah,

137
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,820
 right at the beginning.

138
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,080
 Now Elijah, the Tishbite from Tishbe in Gilead

139
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,880
 said to Ahab, "As the Lord, the God of Israel lives,

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,720
 "whom I serve, there will neither be dew nor rain

141
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,600
 "in the next few years, except at my word."

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
 Now before we get into the details,

143
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,680
 it's gonna, I'm gonna give you a little bit of context.

144
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,080
 It might be helpful to see the state of Israel

145
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,720
 at this moment.

146
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,480
 So after entering into the promised land,

147
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,360
 we talked about Joshua a few weeks ago.

148
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
 Remember entering into the promised land.

149
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,080
 They've established themselves as a kingdom, right?

150
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,360
 They have these kings and under King David,

151
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,600
 Israel becomes the most powerful and prosperous

152
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,340
 and dominant nation in the whole entire world.

153
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,480
 Things are good and God is faithful to the covenant

154
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,120
 that he's made with his people, right?

155
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,040
 This will be a land flowing with milk and honey.

156
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,880
 You'll be prosperous.

157
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,960
 Everything you need will be provided for.

158
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,240
 God is blessing his people.

159
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,560
 And King David dies and his son Solomon

160
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,600
 takes over the throne and this continues, right?

161
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,440
 This is like the golden age in Israel's history, right?

162
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,200
 Solomon is a king known for his wisdom, right?

163
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,080
 His amazing wisdom, which was given to him by God,

164
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,040
 but also for the riches that even nations and leaders

165
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,520
 from far away places would come and marvel

166
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,520
 at just how powerful Israel had become under God's blessing.

167
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,560
 That is, of course, until Solomon's heart

168
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,640
 turns towards idols, right?

169
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,520
 And we're told towards the end of his life,

170
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,320
 the woman, the people that he marries, right,

171
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,520
 has, the many women that he marries,

172
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,520
 have turned his heart away from God towards these idols.

173
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
 And this violates the commitment

174
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,440
 that Israel had made with God.

175
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,360
 The first two commandments say this, right?

176
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,560
 You shall have no other gods before me.

177
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,000
 Second, you shall not make for yourself an image

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,960
 in the form of anything in heaven above

179
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,200
 or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.

180
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,240
 You shall not bow down to them or worship them.

181
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,320
 So there's a consequence to their sin.

182
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,240
 And as a consequence, God says the kingdom of Israel

183
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,920
 is no longer gonna be unified and peaceful as it once was,

184
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,600
 but it's gonna be torn in two.

185
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,920
 And the peace and prosperity we see comes to an end.

186
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,480
 And from then on, we see Israel

187
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,200
 with a long and complicated history, right,

188
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,720
 of going through different kings, different leaders.

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,000
 Sadly, most of it involves them constantly being enticed

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,800
 to worship idols and false gods,

191
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,200
 which leads to them being invaded by other countries,

192
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,040
 taken away into exile.

193
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,960
 They've turned away from the government

194
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,000
 that they first had with God

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,880
 and started doing evil in the sight of the Lord.

196
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,680
 So God sends prophets and messengers

197
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,640
 constantly to his people.

198
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,680
 And these prophets warn people, right,

199
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,840
 messages of correction, messages of consequences

200
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,320
 in order to let people know,

201
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,040
 hey, we're going in the wrong direction.

202
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,240
 Remember who God is.

203
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,600
 Remember the God that brought you out of Egypt.

204
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,280
 Remember who he is to us.

205
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,440
 Turn your hearts back towards him.

206
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,720
 These are always an invitation, right,

207
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,440
 to say, come back towards me.

208
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,720
 This is your rightful place,

209
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,720
 not with these other gods and idols that you've turned to,

210
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,960
 but with me, the one true God.

211
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,800
 And I'm emphasizing this because when we look

212
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,160
 at these stories in the Old Testament sometimes,

213
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,240
 God seems like a grumpy, heartless old man, right,

214
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,920
 someone who's only interested in punishing his people

215
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,480
 for the bad thing that they've done.

216
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,640
 But when we look a little bit deeper,

217
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,000
 we see the motivation behind God's actions.

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,960
 And his heart is never just to punish

219
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
 for the sake of punishing,

220
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,920
 but he corrects, he leads people back,

221
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,240
 and yes, there are consequences,

222
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,880
 but it's always out of love.

223
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,760
 And God's heart is that none of his people should perish.

224
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,200
 And we actually see God is a merciful God.

225
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,640
 And he's not just angry at the way

226
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,720
 that Israels have turned their hearts away from him,

227
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,480
 but actually his heart is broken when we turn away from him.

228
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,360
 He doesn't want his people, his children,

229
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,640
 to be worshiping idols because he wants them close to him.

230
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,760
 He wants them safe.

231
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,000
 He knows that the only place,

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,120
 the best place for them to be,

233
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,360
 the way they were designed to live

234
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,320
 is in close relationship to the creator.

235
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,280
 Again, not because he's some great control freak,

236
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,120
 but because this is truly the way God has called us

237
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,880
 and designed us and created us to live,

238
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,680
 in steadfast, in relationship, in obedience to him.

239
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,440
 So God has to let us know, I want you close to me.

240
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,480
 And every time you break that promise,

241
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,360
 every time you turn away from me,

242
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,920
 there are gonna be consequences,

243
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,360
 real and serious consequences

244
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,520
 that you'll have to face in your habitual sin.

245
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,480
 And it's in a moment like this, in Israel's history,

246
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,080
 that Elijah appears to us.

247
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,680
 Like I said, out of nowhere, he brings up this prophet

248
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,440
 and speaks a word over the nation of Israel.

249
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,520
 And the current king is a guy called Ahab.

250
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,120
 And like some other kings before him,

251
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,360
 Ahab had allowed idol worship to run rampant.

252
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
 He had married a woman called Jezebel,

253
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,520
 and Jezebel was a worshiper of the god called Baal.

254
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,640
 And Baal was known as an evil king,

255
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,560
 one of these Canaanite, God, sorry,

256
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,280
 one of these Canaanite idols that enticed people

257
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,880
 to do bad and evil things.

258
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,720
 She herself is so against God

259
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,800
 that she orders the prophets of Yahweh to be put to death.

260
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,000
 All this to say it's not a good time

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,840
 to be a follower of God at this time.

262
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,400
 And so when Elijah steps onto the scene,

263
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,120
 he has a strong and direct word to King Ahab.

264
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
 This is a big deal.

265
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,240
 It's sort of like a turning point.

266
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,120
 It's hoping to be a turning point,

267
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,640
 once again, in the history of Israel.

268
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,760
 Elijah comes up to the king and says,

269
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,160
 as the Lord God of Israel lives, like we said just now,

270
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,320
 whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain

271
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,920
 in the next few years except at my word.

272
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,720
 Now again, like I said before, this sounds kind of harsh.

273
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,040
 Right, you're gonna withhold rain,

274
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,000
 you're gonna make there be a famine,

275
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
 and there's gonna be a drought

276
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
 just because people aren't following you.

277
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,640
 But in reality, this is a warning, there's a consequence.

278
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,560
 The Israelites have already known

279
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,200
 about the consequences of idolatry.

280
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,240
 Back when God was giving the law to the Israelites,

281
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
 he told them, this land that I'm bringing you into,

282
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,200
 this is the promised land.

283
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,960
 It will be flowing with milk and honey.

284
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,680
 There will be fruitful, there will be rain,

285
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,400
 the ground will produce grain,

286
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,000
 there's gonna be wine and olive oil,

287
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 all these things for you if you would love the Lord your God

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,400
 and serve him with your whole heart and with all your soul.

289
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,080
 But if you do not, the warning was that

290
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,360
 God would shut up the heavens so that it will not rain

291
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,120
 and the ground would yield no produce.

292
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,560
 Deuteronomy chapter 11,

293
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,520
 if you wanna check it out for yourself.

294
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,040
 And as the Israelites are stuck in this cycle,

295
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,760
 the theological term for this is apostasy.

296
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,360
 Right, and under King Ahab, like we said,

297
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,240
 it's particularly bad, taking a liking to worshiping Baal.

298
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,520
 And Baal was supposed to be the god of thunder, of lightning.

299
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,600
 He was supposed to be the one in control over the weather.

300
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,360
 Right, Baal was seen as the god of fertility.

301
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,360
 He was supposed to be the god who provided for people

302
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,800
 through controlling the weather

303
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,280
 and being able to make the seasons come and go,

304
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,720
 making the land produce, all that kind of stuff.

305
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,240
 That was supposed to be his role.

306
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,080
 Now, we have to ask ourselves the question though, why?

307
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,280
 Why were the Israelites so into Baal worship?

308
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,800
 You would think after all that they'd been through,

309
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,080
 right, the way that God had brought them out of slavery,

310
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,040
 out of Egypt, into the promised land,

311
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,080
 the different things that they had experienced

312
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,800
 and seen firsthand, the power of God at work,

313
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
 the stories that had been passed down

314
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,680
 through the generations, right,

315
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,280
 they would have been a little bit more loyal to him.

316
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,760
 The attractiveness of Baal worship

317
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,000
 laid in the fact that people could worship Baal

318
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,040
 on their own terms.

319
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,120
 They could fulfill the desires, the dark, evil desires

320
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,880
 through worshiping Baal, right?

321
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,640
 Baal was an encourager of heavy drinking,

322
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,520
 of sexual license, the temple prostitutes,

323
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,280
 both male and female, were a very popular part

324
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,080
 of what it meant to worship Baal.

325
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,520
 In other words, they could live in sin.

326
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,880
 They could live in immorality.

327
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
 They could do whatever they wanted

328
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,080
 and still call that worship.

329
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,520
 This is the root of our adolatory church,

330
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,560
 when we put our own desires above

331
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,040
 how God has called us to live.

332
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,360
 So as we're sitting here, we have to ask ourselves today,

333
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,560
 where are the idols in our lives?

334
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,920
 Where have we given up our knowledge of God

335
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,320
 and how he has called us to live

336
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,480
 just to satisfy our own wants and desires?

337
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,800
 And we might not be literally worshiping idols

338
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,880
 and images of Baal today, but if there's anything,

339
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,200
 anything at all that has taken your focus away from God

340
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,220
 and onto yourself and pleasing yourself,

341
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,680
 that is an idol, just like Baal was for the Israelites.

342
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,120
 And some of us are in this time right now,

343
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,800
 we're facing dry seas in our life,

344
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,540
 wondering why we aren't seeing fruit and progress,

345
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,560
 knowing all the while that we haven't given our hearts

346
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,360
 wholly to God, that we've been following these idols

347
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,580
 instead of fixing and following in the footsteps of Jesus.

348
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,900
 And so when Elijah pronounces this challenge,

349
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,600
 this statement, it wasn't just to King Ahab,

350
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,560
 it was to Baal himself.

351
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,260
 This was God was saying, you know what?

352
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,520
 I am the one, I am truly the one

353
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,040
 who's in charge of creation.

354
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,620
 I'm the one who created the world in the first place.

355
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,560
 You might think Baal has control over the weather,

356
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,420
 no, that's me.

357
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,860
 I am the most high God.

358
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,400
 I am the provider, I am the I am.

359
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,420
 I am the creator and idols have no power over me.

360
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,300
 I am the only and one true God.

361
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,120
 And it's a challenge for us and a reminder for us

362
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,920
 today as well.

363
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,280
 If we want to see God work in our lives,

364
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,400
 if we want to bear fruit, if we want life,

365
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,660
 then we must put down our idols

366
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,540
 in order to follow God wholeheartedly.

367
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,500
 And we're about to see through these encounters

368
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,520
 Elijah has with God, three main encounters.

369
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,240
 Each encounter gets increasingly more dramatic

370
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,640
 and ends up with one of the most awesome displays

371
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,200
 of power that we see in the Old Testament,

372
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,000
 displays of his power and his presence.

373
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,800
 All this to prove that there is only one God.

374
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,040
 Even Elijah's name itself testifies to this fact.

375
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,580
 Elijah means Yahweh is my God.

376
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,320
 And I hope that this statement is one

377
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,860
 that we'll be able to walk away with today

378
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,460
 as we look at this passage, these passages together.

379
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,880
 So let's look at these encounters

380
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,120
 because I think they're gonna give us

381
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,040
 a really clear picture of who God is

382
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,020
 and why he is the only true God.

383
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,020
 First encounter involves a brook and some ravens.

384
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,260
 Let me explain.

385
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,560
 So immediately after dropping the mic on a head,

386
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,480
 so to speak, and announcing this drought,

387
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,320
 Elijah is commanded to go and hide in a ravine.

388
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,240
 And whilst he's in hiding, whilst he's in this ravine,

389
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,280
 God provides for him in a miraculous way.

390
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,400
 You know, he's out in the wilderness

391
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,880
 and sort of like a homage, you know,

392
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,440
 if you read through the Old Testament,

393
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,480
 you see these patterns of how God works, right?

394
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,640
 How God looked after his people in Israel,

395
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,000
 he continues to do the same for Elijah

396
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,360
 by feeding him in the desert,

397
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,320
 by providing him food and water,

398
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,380
 even though there's a drought and famine going on.

399
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,640
 It's an amazing little story.

400
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,800
 This is what God says.

401
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,280
 "Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah,

402
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,800
 "leave here, turn eastward,

403
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,280
 "and hide in Kareth ravine, east of the Jordan.

404
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,940
 "You will drink from the brook that I have directed

405
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,520
 "the ravens to supply you with food there.

406
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,320
 "So he did what the Lord had told him.

407
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,340
 "He went to the Kareth ravine, east of the Jordan,

408
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,780
 "and stayed there.

409
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,000
 "The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning,

410
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,860
 "and meat and bread in the evening,

411
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,000
 "and he drank from the brook."

412
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,240
 So as we saw with the person of Joshua,

413
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,480
 Elijah has this spirit, has this mindset

414
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,980
 that is fixed on obeying God,

415
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,720
 to trust him at all times,

416
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,000
 even when it didn't make sense.

417
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,680
 Go and hide in the desert?

418
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,780
 But how am I gonna survive?

419
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,720
 How am I gonna live?

420
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,080
 But notice, every time God asks for our obedience,

421
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,160
 he always shows us his power and ability to protect us

422
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,800
 and to provide for us and to guide us

423
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,680
 if we follow his guidance.

424
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,400
 We see this in the middle of a drought.

425
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,560
 Elijah, God leads Elijah to water.

426
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,080
 When everyone is feeling the effects of famine,

427
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,060
 God brings meat and food to Elijah.

428
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,160
 This is God displaying that in fact,

429
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,320
 he is the one in control over everything.

430
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,960
 Over his creation, he provides these ravens

431
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,560
 to bring Elijah bread and meat twice a day.

432
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,760
 This is a clear picture of God's rich providence.

433
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
 You have to understand that back in that time,

434
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,200
 getting to eat meat twice a day was a rich fare,

435
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,400
 would have been a privilege even in the best of times.

436
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,000
 And here, God is providing above and beyond.

437
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,920
 All this to say, God will always unfailingly

438
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,800
 take care of those who rely on him.

439
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,840
 And this is a word and a reminder for us.

440
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,500
 Be confident, church, that if God has called you to it

441
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,280
 in his way, he will see you through

442
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,660
 if you trust and obey.

443
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:37,600
 And we continue to see God work through Elijah in this way.

444
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,680
 God then moves Elijah on to his next encounter.

445
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,760
 We're told that the water in the brook dries up,

446
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,640
 so it's time to move on.

447
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,820
 And God says to him, go at once to Zarephath

448
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,200
 in the region of Sidon and stay there.

449
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,520
 I have directed a widow there to supply you with food.

450
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,660
 So Elijah continues on his journey.

451
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,320
 Like I said, this is a journey that Elijah's taken

452
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,380
 that's gonna culminate in this amazing encounter with God.

453
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,860
 This next step he has to take, though,

454
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,820
 is actually taking him directly into the heart

455
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,860
 of Baal's territory, of his home turf.

456
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,900
 God is surely and slowly moving Elijah

457
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,980
 into a direct confrontation with Baal.

458
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,480
 And so surely enough, Elijah gets to his destination

459
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,600
 and he meets a woman, a widow and her son, struggling on,

460
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,220
 struggling to survive through this drought and this famine.

461
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,040
 And Elijah asks her for water and some food.

462
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,280
 Now it's strange 'cause she's really in no position

463
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,320
 to help Elijah.

464
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,040
 So she says to him, as surely as the Lord your God lives,

465
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,040
 she replied, I don't have any bread,

466
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,960
 only a handful of flour in a jar

467
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,180
 and a little olive oil in a jug.

468
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
 I'm gathering a few sticks to take home

469
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,700
 and make a meal for myself and my son

470
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,380
 that we may eat it and die.

471
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,400
 Notice her response.

472
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,200
 This woman does not yet have a belief in God.

473
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,520
 She acknowledges, she kind of knows who God is,

474
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,620
 she's probably heard stories about him,

475
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,160
 but she says, it's the Lord your God, Elijah,

476
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,940
 your God, not my God.

477
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,360
 She was probably a Baal worshiper herself.

478
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,560
 But it seems as though she's already given up hope

479
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,840
 and she's waiting for death.

480
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,360
 Her so-called God, who was supposed to look after her,

481
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,840
 who was supposed to be able to provide her with food

482
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,680
 and all these things, has failed.

483
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,780
 And all is lost.

484
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,480
 Life as she knows it at this moment is over.

485
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,520
 And but this made me think,

486
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,400
 maybe for some of us here today,

487
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,280
 we're feeling a little bit like this woman.

488
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,000
 And we're sitting here today, we've heard about God,

489
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,680
 we've heard about who he is,

490
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,840
 but you would not say yet you had a relationship with God,

491
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,920
 even though you've heard about him.

492
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,480
 And you might not literally be starving to death,

493
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,660
 but maybe in your spirit, in your outlook on life,

494
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,880
 in your hope, it's felt like you've been a season

495
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,320
 of drought and famine.

496
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,720
 And the things that you've been putting your faith in

497
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,320
 have failed you.

498
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,640
 And it feels like life has lost all meaning

499
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,320
 and there's really nothing else now to live for.

500
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,620
 Maybe this is a word for you.

501
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,520
 As these words of Elijah spoke to this widow

502
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,640
 brought her hope, I pray that if this is you today,

503
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,200
 you resonate with these words

504
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,360
 and it will bring you hope as well.

505
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,680
 Elijah says to her, do not be afraid.

506
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,240
 Do not be afraid.

507
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,040
 This is the word of life.

508
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,080
 He's about to tell her God's gonna take care of this.

509
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,080
 So he says to her, this is what the Lord,

510
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,100
 the God of Israel says.

511
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,440
 The jar of flour will not be used up

512
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,840
 and the jug of oil will not run dry

513
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,560
 until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.

514
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,080
 And this is exactly what happens.

515
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,500
 She thought she only had a little left, but God sustains it.

516
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,740
 The jar of flour does not get used up.

517
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,720
 The jug of oil does not run dry.

518
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,080
 In keeping word with the words that are spoken by Elijah

519
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,940
 through the, sorry, through Elijah by the Lord.

520
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,240
 If we're in a season today, church,

521
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,720
 where it feels like the hope, your hope has run dry,

522
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,800
 if you're in a season where you feel like you're done

523
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,540
 trusting in other things,

524
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,360
 maybe the answer for you today is to turn to God,

525
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,120
 to hear him say, do not be afraid,

526
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,900
 to hear him say, I will give you hope and life again.

527
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,520
 You might feel like I've run out of bread.

528
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,480
 The things that have been sustaining my life have run out.

529
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,040
 But Jesus says, I am the bread of life.

530
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,640
 You might think I only have a little handful left.

531
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,480
 There's not much, I'm hanging on by a thread here.

532
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,560
 But God says he will bring you to a place of abundance.

533
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,640
 It may seem like there's only

534
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,120
 this tiny little bit of oil left

535
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,000
 and once I use it up, that's it.

536
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,100
 I don't know what else I'm gonna hope in.

537
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:17,480
 God says, put your trust in me and your cup will overflow.

538
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,200
 God is the only one who's able to sustain your faith.

539
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,600
 He's the only source where as long as you put your hope

540
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,680
 in him, your hope will never run dry.

541
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,680
 We see that even in the worst of times.

542
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,240
 As we read on in this story, right,

543
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,680
 God provides for her son and for herself for a while,

544
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,480
 but things get worse.

545
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,780
 Her son dies whilst Elijah is staying with them.

546
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,360
 But again, look how God wants to display his power.

547
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,080
 Even in the face of death, God remains sovereign.

548
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,640
 This is God really proving I am the true God.

549
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,520
 I am the only God of life.

550
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,120
 And this woman's son dies and she laments,

551
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,920
 why did you come here just to kill my son?

552
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,680
 And so Elijah again prays, oh my Lord,

553
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,280
 let this boy's life return to him.

554
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,080
 And through Elijah's prayer,

555
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,480
 God brings the boy back to life.

556
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,800
 And all this is going to show this is God's way

557
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,080
 of reaching this woman, of encountering this woman,

558
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,800
 to let her know that he is the true God.

559
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,560
 And she declares it herself with her mouth,

560
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,360
 now I know that you are man of God

561
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,920
 and the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth.

562
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,200
 Church, let me say this again.

563
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,760
 If you feel as though hope in your life is lost today,

564
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,360
 if you feel that hope in your life even is dead today,

565
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,120
 if you want to know the true God

566
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,200
 who is the source of all life and all hope,

567
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,160
 cry out to him, call on him.

568
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,200
 He is the only one who is able to give you life.

569
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:00,280
 And so after helping out this widow and her son,

570
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,360
 making sure that they're gonna be okay and taken care of,

571
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,000
 finally now it's time for Elijah to go

572
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,840
 and confront the evil King Ahab face to face.

573
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,320
 It's been a long time, the Bible told us,

574
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,080
 since they had last met.

575
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,160
 After a long time, three years, in the third year,

576
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,320
 the word of the Lord came to Elijah.

577
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,040
 Go and present yourself to Ahab

578
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,160
 and I will send rain on the land.

579
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,240
 So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab.

580
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,320
 Now, a little bit more about Ahab.

581
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,160
 It's clear by now to us, to the reader,

582
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,560
 if you've been reading through the story,

583
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,920
 that Ahab is not the kind of king,

584
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,520
 not the kind of leader that was fit

585
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,800
 to lead the people of God, to lead the nation of Israel.

586
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,560
 If you read a little bit more in the passage 1 Kings 18,

587
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,280
 it tells us, yes, the land was in time

588
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,920
 of severe famine and drought,

589
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,760
 but instead of looking after his people,

590
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,440
 King Ahab is still more interested

591
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,200
 in looking after his own things.

592
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,520
 Ahab orders people to go out and look for resources,

593
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,520
 but not because he wants to help his people.

594
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,440
 He says, well, let's go out, look for grass,

595
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,040
 look for water, so that the horses and the mules

596
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,000
 will be kept alive and we don't have

597
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,580
 to kill any of our own animals.

598
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,760
 Well, this is strange, right,

599
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,840
 'cause if Ahab was a good leader,

600
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,400
 he would have been out making sure

601
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,880
 that people like the people Elijah just helped,

602
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,520
 the widows and the orphans he had just encountered,

603
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,760
 will be taken care of.

604
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,600
 This was the call of the Israelite king

605
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,160
 to look after the widows and the orphans.

606
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,800
 But yet he's far more concerned

607
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,680
 and worried about his own possessions.

608
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,280
 He is more interested in self-preservation.

609
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,260
 Again, this just goes to prove, right,

610
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,840
 whatever we worship will end up dictating

611
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,160
 how we live our lives.

612
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,720
 As Jesus put it, where our treasure is,

613
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,460
 there your heart will be also.

614
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,520
 And I was reading this part,

615
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,160
 I felt like God was reminding me

616
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,840
 to ask ourselves a question,

617
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,360
 where are our priorities, excuse me?

618
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,080
 Where do our priorities lie?

619
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,360
 Do we have our hearts set on the things of God

620
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,600
 or on the things of man?

621
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,920
 Because whenever we're chasing idols

622
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,280
 and things that are not of God,

623
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,680
 our priorities are gonna be messed up.

624
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,340
 And a good way to check to see

625
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,720
 if we're giving in to the idols in our lives

626
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,660
 is to look at our priorities.

627
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,560
 Right, we do a heart check and a mind check.

628
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,160
 Ask ourselves the tough questions,

629
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,240
 what are we holding as important?

630
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,640
 Where do we find ourselves putting our resources,

631
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,880
 our time, our money?

632
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,240
 What is our mind filled with?

633
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,680
 What are these goals that we're trying to hit?

634
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,360
 Because if they're not the things that are on God's heart,

635
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,080
 then maybe it's time for us to start making some changes.

636
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,480
 Making, maybe it's time for us to realign our priorities,

637
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,780
 to make sure that our hearts are set aligned

638
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,200
 with what God has on his heart.

639
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,560
 But Ahab is not able to see this.

640
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,160
 Instead, when Elijah comes to him,

641
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,820
 he sees Elijah as, okay, here's someone

642
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,860
 that I can blame for all my problems.

643
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:19,280
 As Ahab and Elijah meet, Ahab says to him,

644
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,980
 is that you, you troubler of Israel?

645
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,280
 Now I'm not sure, but have you ever been called

646
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,480
 a troublemaker?

647
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,520
 Well let me look at it, ask it this way.

648
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,880
 When you hear the term troublemaker, who comes to mind?

649
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,080
 Don't look at them right now, okay?

650
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,920
 I mean, I can see a few, a corner of my eye right now.

651
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,760
 Okay, I'm not gonna call you out, Justin, all right?

652
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,840
 But you know, I'm.

653
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
 (audience laughing)

654
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,640
 I used to be called a troublemaker a lot, actually,

655
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,720
 when I was, believe it or not, when I was at school.

656
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,760
 One of the questions I would hate being asked,

657
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,440
 and I was asked almost, maybe not every day,

658
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,400
 but every other day, right?

659
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,800
 The teachers would say, "Hey, listen, tell me

660
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,400
 "what you've done wrong today.

661
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,760
 "What trouble have you got into?"

662
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,440
 Right, and I never knew how to answer,

663
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,520
 because on any day, I've done multiple things wrong,

664
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,960
 all right, so I wouldn't wanna say something

665
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,240
 that the teacher didn't already know

666
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,560
 and get myself into even more trouble, right?

667
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,600
 Something they didn't already know about.

668
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,660
 But Ahab, when Ahab calls Elijah a troublemaker,

669
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,660
 this was an accusation.

670
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,520
 It was an insult.

671
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,880
 Like I said, he was putting the blame on Elijah

672
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,160
 for the drought and the famine that they were facing.

673
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,280
 This was Ahab's way of saying, "This is your fault, Elijah.

674
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,880
 "You've gone and you've angered Baal,

675
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,600
 "and because you've angered Baal, this is why this famine,

676
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,240
 "this is why this drought is happening.

677
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,800
 "This is why there's been no rain,

678
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,820
 "because you've insulted Baal."

679
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,000
 And again, this just shows how stubborn

680
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,640
 and how far away Ahab's heart had become from God,

681
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,920
 how far away he had turned.

682
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,220
 It's been three years that they've been facing this drought.

683
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,600
 During any time in this three years, Ahab knew the law.

684
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,320
 He knew why this was happening.

685
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,840
 He could have repented at any moment.

686
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,720
 He could have turned his heart back toward God.

687
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,480
 He knew full well, I think, that this famine,

688
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,520
 this drought was due to the idol worship

689
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,920
 that he and he had led other people to participate in,

690
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,380
 and yet he refuses to repent and to change.

691
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,860
 Instead, he tries to shift the blame onto Elijah.

692
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,200
 He points fingers.

693
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,440
 This is easy thing to do, church,

694
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,580
 and it's also cowardly.

695
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,700
 People who are stuck in sin, who refuse to change,

696
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,800
 who refuse to take ownership, will always blame everyone

697
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,400
 and everything else but themselves.

698
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,920
 But again, this just goes to show,

699
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,760
 for those of us who are obediently following God,

700
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,440
 if we're standing the light, if we're doing God's will,

701
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,360
 and if we're being called a troublemaker

702
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,580
 by those doing evil, you know you're doing something right.

703
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,360
 The prophets were often called troublemakers, actually,

704
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,080
 not just Elijah, but the other prophets as well.

705
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,160
 They were called troublemakers

706
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,680
 because they went against the status quo of the time.

707
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,840
 They weren't afraid to speak the words of truth

708
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,500
 and call out sin in people.

709
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,680
 They were called troublemakers

710
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,840
 because they asked the tough questions.

711
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,600
 How are you looking after people?

712
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,520
 What are you doing to fulfill this role

713
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,560
 that God has given to you?

714
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,760
 They were called troublemakers

715
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,640
 because they revealed and spoke the truth.

716
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,800
 The disciples were called troublemakers at one point

717
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,400
 because of their love for Jesus.

718
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,360
 Paul and his friends were called troublemakers

719
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,640
 because they would not shut up about the gospel.

720
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,200
 Even Jesus himself was being called a rebel and a subverter

721
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,580
 because he declared the truth about who he was.

722
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:58,220
 In our fight against idolatry, in our fight against evil,

723
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,160
 we have to be ready, church.

724
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,080
 Anytime we stand up against idolatry,

725
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,200
 anytime we stand up against injustice,

726
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
 anytime we stand up to the principalities

727
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,720
 and power of this world,

728
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,860
 anytime we speak the truth over lies,

729
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,440
 we must be ready to be met with resistance

730
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,140
 and be labeled as troublemakers of this world.

731
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,220
 But take heart.

732
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,700
 We're not the troublemakers.

733
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,420
 We're the ones who are calling people

734
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,860
 to turn their hearts back towards God.

735
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,300
 And so at this point, God says, enough is enough.

736
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,700
 I'm about to show you that actually,

737
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,900
 Ahab is the real troublemaker here.

738
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,540
 And so Elijah challenged him to a showdown.

739
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,420
 He says, Elijah says,

740
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,020
 I have not made trouble for Israel, Elijah replied,

741
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,340
 but you and your father's family have

742
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,340
 because you have abandoned the Lord's commands

743
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,460
 and have followed the Baals.

744
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,860
 Now summon people from all over Israel

745
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,020
 and meet me on Mount Carmel

746
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,540
 and bring the 450 prophets of Baal

747
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:05,420
 and the 450 prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel's table.

748
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,900
 So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel

749
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,860
 and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.

750
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:15,020
 This is like the fight of the century being set up here.

751
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,900
 In Ahab's mind, he probably thought,

752
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,460
 well, okay, this is gonna be an easy victory for me.

753
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,780
 900 prophets of idols, 900 prophets of Baal

754
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,220
 versus just one prophet of Yahweh.

755
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,420
 On paper, this was not a fair fight.

756
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,740
 And to Ahab, this was an opportunity

757
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,900
 to shut this troublemaker up,

758
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,620
 to put this prophet of God to shame.

759
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,380
 With the whole of Israel watching,

760
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,860
 I'm gonna humiliate Elijah before these assembled people.

761
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,940
 He's gonna know that he's wrong

762
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,180
 and then we're gonna kill him.

763
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,700
 That was probably the plan going on in his mind.

764
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,220
 But as we're about to see,

765
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,940
 there's gonna be a rude awakening for Ahab.

766
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:03,020
 You see Elijah though, he's not fazed at all.

767
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,260
 He's not worried about the fact

768
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,100
 that he's going up against 900 of these prophets of Baal.

769
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,620
 It's almost like he knows what's about to happen.

770
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,660
 And in the midst of all this,

771
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,940
 I don't want us to miss this, right,

772
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,180
 his main concern is still for God's people.

773
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,940
 He has the heart of God towards his people.

774
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,620
 His main concern is a final warning for them

775
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,900
 to wake them up, to help them change

776
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,740
 their hearts and their minds.

777
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,420
 Elijah went before the people and said,

778
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,460
 "How long will you waver between two opinions?

779
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,940
 "If the Lord is God, follow him.

780
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,460
 "But if Baal is God, follow him."

781
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,700
 But the people said nothing.

782
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,260
 It's a significant challenge

783
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,100
 that Elijah lays down to the people.

784
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,780
 Again, as we've already mentioned, right,

785
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,420
 the main problem that Israel had

786
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,940
 was constantly slipping into apostasy.

787
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,500
 Following God in one instance

788
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,260
 and then giving up on him in the next.

789
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,780
 And it's a pattern that, if we're honest with ourselves,

790
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,660
 maybe we find ourselves falling into today as well.

791
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,340
 We know who God is, for those of us who do.

792
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,260
 But at times, right, Baal worship,

793
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,180
 idol worship is still very enticing.

794
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,860
 We have seen God work in our lives,

795
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,020
 but at times our hearts are still drawn

796
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,660
 towards these idols that we hold.

797
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,660
 And Elijah's question to the Israelites

798
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,260
 still stands to us today.

799
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,420
 How long will we waver?

800
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,460
 Because there's no such thing as being a Christian

801
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,940
 yet still putting our faith in things that are not of God.

802
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,620
 We cannot claim to be a Christian

803
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,100
 but still find spirituality and spiritual hope

804
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,380
 in other sources like feng shui or tarot cards

805
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,940
 or horoscopes and things like that.

806
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,140
 We cannot claim to be following Jesus

807
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,740
 but yet prioritize our business, our status,

808
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,700
 things of this world over how he has called us to live.

809
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,820
 So Elijah tells them, you have to get off the fence.

810
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,500
 Make up your mind.

811
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,140
 Other parts of the Bible says this,

812
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,100
 no one can be a slave of two masters.

813
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,380
 Jesus tells us if we're not for him,

814
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,580
 then we're against him.

815
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,940
 Revelation 3:16 says, so because you are lukewarm,

816
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,460
 neither hot or cold, I'm about to spit you out of my mouth.

817
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,780
 But the people said nothing.

818
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:36,260
 Church, let's not be a people who say nothing.

819
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,060
 God is not looking for a church that is silent.

820
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,980
 God is not looking for those whose faith tosses and turns.

821
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,500
 God is not looking for people whose faith is hidden

822
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
 while there's injustice in this world,

823
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,620
 whilst there are still people

824
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,100
 who don't know the love of Jesus.

825
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,580
 And I pray as this body of Christ, as this community,

826
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,900
 we will never be a people that stay silent,

827
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,100
 that we will never be a church that is afraid

828
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,740
 to cause trouble for the evildoers of this world.

829
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,340
 And I pray that as a church, we'll be loud and bold

830
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,020
 and active in our faith,

831
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,420
 because we know that the God we serve

832
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,340
 is the most high or powerful God.

833
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,980
 And we're about to see Elijah prove it.

834
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,540
 Elijah said to them, I am only one of the Lord's prophets

835
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,460
 left, but Baal has 450 prophets.

836
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,100
 Get two bulls for us.

837
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,220
 Let Baal's prophets choose one for themselves

838
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,020
 and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood,

839
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,940
 but not set fire to it.

840
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,220
 I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood,

841
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,980
 but not set fire to it.

842
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,020
 Then you call upon the name of your God,

843
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
 and I will call the name of the Lord.

844
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,940
 The God who answers by fire, he is God.

845
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,060
 Then all the people said, what you say is good.

846
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,740
 Elijah said to the prophets of Baal,

847
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,020
 choose one of the bulls and prepare it first,

848
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,980
 since there are so many of you.

849
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,380
 Call upon the name of your God, but do not light the fire.

850
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,140
 So they took the bull given them and prepared it.

851
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,180
 Then they called upon the name of Baal

852
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,740
 from morning until noon.

853
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,180
 Baal, answer us, they shouted.

854
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:17,460
 Things are made as hard for Yahweh as possible.

855
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,460
 Elijah is one against 400.

856
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,380
 Baal's people get the first choice of the bull.

857
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,620
 The whole thing is set up to try and tip the scales

858
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,060
 against Elijah.

859
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,700
 And the Baals, they make the first move,

860
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,940
 so it's like if you're playing a game of badminton

861
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,780
 or tennis or something, right?

862
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,740
 If you serve first, it's always your advantage, right?

863
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,340
 So all the advantage was given to the prophets

864
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,900
 and the worshipers of Baal.

865
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,220
 Everything was done to tip the balance against them,

866
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,100
 to make this not into a fair fight.

867
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,580
 But check this out.

868
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,940
 There was no response.

869
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,660
 No one answered.

870
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,420
 And they danced around at the altar they had made.

871
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,340
 At noon, Elijah began to taunt them.

872
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,100
 Shout louder, he said.

873
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,180
 Surely he's God.

874
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,020
 Maybe he's in deep thought or busy or traveling.

875
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,180
 Some translation says maybe he's on the toilet, right?

876
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,820
 Maybe he's sleeping and must be awakened.

877
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,940
 They shouted louder and slashed themselves

878
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,940
 with swords and spears as was their custom

879
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,860
 until their blood flowed.

880
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,060
 Midday passed and they continued their frantic prophesying

881
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,180
 until the time of evening sacrifice,

882
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,780
 but there was no response.

883
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,940
 No one answered.

884
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,500
 No one paid attention.

885
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,780
 How ironic.

886
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,740
 Now if Baal worship wasn't such an evil practice,

887
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,580
 you would almost feel sorry for them

888
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,500
 as what's happening here.

889
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,740
 They tried to humiliate Elijah,

890
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,420
 but they're the ones being humiliated right now.

891
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,660
 I mean, these prophets put up every trick in the book.

892
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,780
 All these tactics were things that were supposed to entice

893
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,380
 a reaction from Baal.

894
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,100
 The self-mutilation, the frantic prophesying

895
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,100
 were supposed to be tactics to get Baal's attention.

896
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,420
 But in the end, it's absolutely useless.

897
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,900
 But this made me think.

898
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,100
 In the same way for us,

899
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,940
 the efforts that we put into pleasing and chasing our idols,

900
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,540
 all the effort we put into the things of this world

901
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,620
 will always amount to nothing.

902
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,780
 This is why every time we chase idols,

903
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,620
 we always end up feeling empty inside.

904
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,060
 It never works.

905
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,620
 This is why the things of this world will never satisfy us.

906
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,620
 No matter how much of it we have,

907
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,380
 we always want more of it.

908
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,940
 We're never satisfied.

909
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,380
 So why are we running around, making so much effort,

910
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,460
 in some cases even hurting ourselves,

911
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,780
 to try and please these idols,

912
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,820
 to try and get much of these things we can

913
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,780
 to things that will never really be able to respond

914
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,540
 and to satisfy us?

915
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,020
 The things of this world, church, will never satisfy.

916
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,500
 They will never be able to answer our prayers.

917
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,220
 Contrast this to Elijah's response.

918
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,140
 He repairs the altar, he arranges the wood,

919
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,900
 he puts his sacrifice, drenches the whole thing in water.

920
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,420
 We're taught it's drenched in water, and he says a prayer.

921
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:17,460
 Elijah says, "Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,

922
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,740
 "let it be known today that you are God in Israel

923
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,580
 "and that I am your servant

924
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,700
 "and have done all these things at your command.

925
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,260
 "Answer me, Lord.

926
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,180
 "Answer me so that these people will know

927
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,260
 "that you, God, are God,

928
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,620
 "and that you are turning their hearts back again."

929
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,020
 It's a soft prayer compared to the franticness

930
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,380
 of the prophets of Baal.

931
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,180
 But there's a really beautiful thing about this prayer

932
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,900
 that really reveals Elijah's pastoral heart

933
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,820
 and God's heart for his people.

934
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,180
 Because yet, yes, he is frustrated

935
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,860
 that people have turned to idol worship.

936
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,380
 The double-mindedness of these people

937
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,900
 has gone against the will of God.

938
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,500
 But notice the prayer.

939
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,540
 The prayer is not yet, "Punish these people.

940
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,020
 "Kill them right now, God.

941
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,060
 "They deserve death.

942
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,420
 "Look how they've turned away from you."

943
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,540
 That's not what Elijah says.

944
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,540
 Rather, it's for them to have their eyes opened,

945
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,980
 to have their hearts restored.

946
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,500
 Let them know you are God

947
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,860
 so they can turn their hearts back to you.

948
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,500
 Like I said in the beginning,

949
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,420
 this is always God's heart for his people,

950
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,580
 for them to be back to him again,

951
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,140
 for them to be back close to him

952
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,460
 so that he can love on them

953
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,820
 and he can provide for them and take care of them

954
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,300
 in the best way that he knows how.

955
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,940
 God responds so that his children

956
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,500
 will turn their hearts back to him.

957
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,500
 God responds in a way for everyone to see who he is.

958
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,540
 And when God responds, there is no hoax.

959
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,740
 There is no deception.

960
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,540
 It's a powerful and direct answer,

961
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,220
 a true display of his power.

962
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:14,420
 Then the fire of the Lord fell and burned up the sacrifice,

963
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,660
 the wood, the stones, the soil.

964
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,260
 Think about how powerful that fire would have to be

965
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,260
 to burn up stones, to lick up the water in the trench.

966
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,420
 When the people saw this, they felt prostrate and cried,

967
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,540
 the Lord, he is God, the Lord, he is God.

968
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,860
 The story ends with a powerful

969
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,660
 and dramatic encounter with God,

970
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,260
 through God's fire, the all-consuming fire,

971
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,300
 the holy fire, the fire that leaves people

972
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,820
 with no doubt that God is the only true God.

973
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,220
 The fire that leaves people with no choice

974
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,380
 but to bow down and worship him.

975
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:00,140
 Church, we spent the past few weeks in this series

976
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,580
 talking about wanting to encounter God.

977
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,700
 But if we really want a true encounter with God

978
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,740
 that's gonna be lasting and changes our lives

979
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,100
 and changes our hearts, we have to get rid

980
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,900
 of the idols in our lives, church.

981
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:18,620
 We have to get away everything that's distracted us

982
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,660
 from him, who he's called us to be,

983
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,100
 how he's called us to live, so that him and him alone

984
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,300
 sits at the highest priority out of everything

985
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,500
 that we live for.

986
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,540
 So we're gonna take a moment right now, church, to pray.

987
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,420
 And I'm gonna pray and ask God to show us

988
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,180
 where the idols in our lives might be.

989
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:44,860
 And it might be a scary thing to do,

990
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,300
 but I'm gonna ask also for God to come

991
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,220
 and to burn away everything else that doesn't belong

992
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,180
 in our hearts and our minds, to remove these idols

993
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,180
 that we might have turned our heart towards.

994
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,420
 And we'll find that God's heart is one of mercy

995
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,860
 and grace and love.

996
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,220
 He's not seeking to punish us, but he's seeking

997
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,500
 for to turn our hearts back towards him

998
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,060
 because that's the best place for us to be.

999
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:18,140
 So get yourselves comfortable in whatever way

1000
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,020
 you normally talk to God, church.

1001
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,180
 Maybe you wanna close your eyes if that helps you focus

1002
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,340
 or something like that.

1003
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:29,780
 And just do a bit of a heart check right now.

1004
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:35,340
 Have there been things that have taken priority

1005
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,580
 over God in your lives?

1006
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,020
 Have there been things that you've turned to

1007
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,260
 for your source of hope and life instead of Jesus?

1008
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,660
 [soft music]

1009
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,940
 It's a deep question.

1010
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,300
 Sometimes these things are kind of subtle.

1011
00:46:53,300 --> 00:47:00,740
 But as you pray, just allow the Holy Spirit

1012
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,980
 to bring them up.

1013
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,380
 [soft music]

1014
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:21,260
 And one thing that as I was thinking between these services

1015
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,380
 and talking to someone, one of the things

1016
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,740
 that we so often fall victim to as an idol

1017
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,620
 in our society is the praise of man.

1018
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,540
 [soft music]

1019
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,140
 And we start, we wanna do things and perform

1020
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:43,900
 and reach certain goals because we want other people

1021
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,460
 to see, oh yeah, that person is good, that person is great.

1022
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,380
 Or we're trying to please other people's expectations.

1023
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:05,140
 Jesus reminds us, my opinion of you is the most important.

1024
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:13,340
 That's more important to please God rather than man.

1025
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:22,700
 Whatever it is, church, just continue to allow God

1026
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,140
 to speak to you about it.

1027
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:30,340
 And when he does, just confess it to him

1028
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,660
 and tell him about it.

1029
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:35,900
 And then just imagine that fire like Elijah came,

1030
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,900
 come down and burn it away, God's holiness, God's presence.

1031
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:47,700
 And for him to turn your heart back towards him again.

1032
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,820
 So Father, we pray for our hearts, we pray for our minds.

1033
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,980
 Burn everything else away till there's a pure

1034
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,340
 and true desire just for you and you alone.

1035
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,060
 In Jesus' name we pray.

1036
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,580
