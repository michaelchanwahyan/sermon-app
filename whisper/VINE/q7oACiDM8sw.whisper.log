[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Best Christmas video ever!
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Oh my gosh, I don't know about you, but I learned a lot about Christmas from that video.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.920]   I'm glad that we finally settled the age old question of whether there were dinosaurs at
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.920]   Christmas.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.320]   There were.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.800]   We finally got proof that Jesus could fly as a child.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.040]   That's a great thing.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.800]   Apparently there's such a thing as bubble pop.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.000]   Don't know what that is, but yeah.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.960]   I love the fact that Jesus got jewelry on Christmas day.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.840]   And not just jewelry, but pretty shiny jewelry.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.880]   And perhaps my favorite of all, right at the end there when she's like, "There's a light!"
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.080]   Which actually is the only thing in that video that is true.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.640]   There was, there was actually a light there on Christmas day.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.680]   The Bible describes it actually as the glory of God that shone all around.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.560]   In fact, I want to read to you the bit from the Christmas story where it speaks about
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.160]   that light coming and shining.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.680]   It's right after Jesus has actually been born by Mary and Joseph there in the stable.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.880]   And then right after that, the writer of the gospel of Luke, Luke writes this incredible
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.880]   thing.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.280]   He says, verse 8 onwards in chapter 2, "And there were shepherds living out in the fields
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.260]   nearby keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.320]   An angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory," here's the light thing, "the glory
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.320]   of the Lord shone around them.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.220]   And they were terrified.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.480]   For the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid for I bring you good news of great joy that
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.880]   will be for all the people.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.120]   For today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.000]   He is the Christ, the Lord, and this will be a sign to you.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.640]   You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.'"
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.560]   I wonder if you've ever been in a situation where you simply do not belong.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.920]   If you've been here at the Vine for a while, you'll know right at the beginning of this
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.040]   year I shared with you my years-long journey to try to get to silver status at Cafe Pacific.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.240]   Do you remember that?
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.360]   And I told you that because the church purchases my travel tickets on Cafe, they purchase the
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.020]   cheapest ticket that they can find, which is a good thing because that means your tithes
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.020]   go a long way.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.020]   Okay.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.560]   So they, if they, to put it this way, if the church could put me in cargo class, okay,
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.360]   I would fly in cargo class.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.600]   They buy me the cheapest ticket possible, which means it's really hard to like get the
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.720]   sector points to finally get up.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.920]   A number of years ago, I was trying to get to silver and I finally got to silver, but
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.120]   I got to silver class just as COVID came and then I lost silver class.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.760]   Well, at the end of this year, I am proud to announce to you that after flying a lot
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.480]   of Cafe during my sabbatical, I am now back on silver class in Cafe Pacific.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.480]   Yes.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   Thank you.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   Thank you.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   Thank you.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480]   I made it back.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.480]   I was so excited.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.240]   I became silver class in the middle of my sabbatical.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.800]   And so I was really excited because I could finally go to the lounge.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.520]   And I haven't been to the lounge for years.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.760]   I could finally go to the lounge again.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.000]   And I was, I was flying back from London to Hong Kong in September.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.480]   And I thought I'm going to use my first lounge access.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.960]   And so I showed up three hours early before the plane took off.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.840]   Because I'm like, I'm going to maximize my lounge time.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   I remember going up to the little desk where you have to go and they have the cafe attendance
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   behind the desk.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.640]   And I whip out my silver card.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.360]   I'm like, I'm here to join the lounge.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.960]   You know, I gave them my little ticket thing and they checked it.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.160]   Oh, yes, Mr. Gardner, we're glad that you're here today.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   You can come into the lounge.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.760]   I'm like, oh, wonderful.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.960]   They're like, just go down the corridor, turn to the right, you'll find the lounge.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.480]   So I go down the corridor, I turn to the right, I open these doors and I come into the lounge.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.640]   Now, I haven't been in a cafe lounge for many years.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.360]   And I don't know what's happened to Cafe Pacific in all those years.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.720]   But the lounge was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.680]   Obviously, cafe has made a lot of money over the last number of years.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.160]   But this lounge was the plushest lounge that I had ever seen in my life.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.280]   I mean, everything was dripping with expense.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.280]   It looked the most amazing thing.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.320]   And the other thing that was interesting about it, there was only two other people in this
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.320]   lounge.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   I thought, wow, it must be really hard to get to silver these days.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.920]   There's only two other people that qualified to get into this lounge.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.400]   And as I walk in, it's funny because they're checking me out.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   They're looking at me.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.760]   But you know when people check you out, but it's not in a good way, it's a bad way.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.960]   And they're like checking me out and they're kind of looking me up and down.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.120]   And so I sort of look at myself and I'm wearing jeans, like a baggy jumper.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   And they're kind of looking at me like, oh, that's kind of strange.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.560]   And I'm like, that's a bit weird.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.400]   Anyway, I find the noodle bar.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.860]   There's a noodle bar in this lounge, right?
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.560]   And there's like this Chinese guy behind the noodle bar, and he's making the noodles right
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.560]   there.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   It's like the most amazing thing.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.000]   I sit down at the noodle bar.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.240]   Immediately, this woman shows up, immaculately dressed with a glass of champagne.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.400]   She gives me a glass of champagne.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.280]   Then she tells me, "Hey, whilst you're here, if you'd like a massage, maybe get a haircut,
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280]   just let us know.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.680]   We're here at your service."
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.760]   And I'm like, this is the most amazing thing ever.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.160]   As I'm sitting there with my glass of champagne, just sipping the high life, another person
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.240]   walks into the lounge.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.240]   It's this woman.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.880]   She's wearing the most beautiful designer-styled pantsuit that I've ever seen.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.100]   She's pulling like Gucci designer luggage.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.680]   She looks amazing.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.720]   And I'm beginning to pull all the threads together of my experience, and I'm beginning
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.280]   to realize, kind of empty, noodle bar, could get a massage, sipping on a glass of champagne,
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   designer luggage.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:29.880]   I suddenly realize I'm sitting in the first class lounge, where I should not be, because
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.080]   I only have silver status.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.640]   And silver, let me tell you, does not get you into first class.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.600]   And so I'm sitting in the first class lounge, thinking to myself, "Hang on a sec.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.440]   I'm having an existential crisis all of a sudden, because I have a decision to make."
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.040]   The first decision is, "Nobody knows that I'm not supposed to be here.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.760]   I could just pretend that I'm supposed to be here.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.480]   I could just get away with pretending that I'm like really rich."
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.900]   And this is great, because there's like levels of richness.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.920]   And I realized that I was like wearing jeans and a baggy jumper.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.560]   But if you are like super rich, you become like scruffy rich.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.400]   Have you ever noticed like the people who are really...
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.960]   Like if you're only medium rich, then you have to wear the designer stuff to prove to
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.280]   everybody that you're rich.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.440]   But when you're rich rich, you can be scruffy rich.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.720]   You're so rich, you don't need to show off.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.120]   You're just wearing jeans and a jumper, because you're that rich.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.520]   So I'm like, "I'm going to be scruffy rich.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.860]   I'm going to pull this off."
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.560]   And I'm sitting there, so I'm like, "I could try to get away with this."
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.040]   The other side of the question was, "Well, maybe I should admit that I'm a pastor, and
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.160]   I live in Hong Kong, and I am not qualified to be where I am right now."
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.040]   So I'm having this existential kind of dilemma, and I'm thinking, "It's probably going to
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.760]   take me about the time to drink a glass of champagne to make this decision."
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.880]   So as I'm sitting there sipping on my champagne, I get this knock on the shoulder, "Mr. Gardner,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.040]   we're terribly sorry, but you're not flying first class today.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.440]   I'm afraid you're in the wrong lounge.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.960]   If you come with us, we will take you to the right lounge that you're supposed to be in."
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.080]   And so, I kid you not, they pick me up, and I have a cafe attendant on my left, a cafe
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.480]   attendant on my right, and they walk me out of the lounge.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.800]   And as they're walking me out of the lounge, everybody in the lounge is going, "Yeah, yeah,
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.840]   I knew, I knew, I knew.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.840]   That's not scruffy rich, that's just scruffy."
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.000]   It hurts, right?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.660]   It feels weird when you're in a place that you shouldn't be, right?
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.940]   If you're in a place where you feel like you don't belong, that's not a very comfortable
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.420]   place to be.
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.420]   It's kind of challenging.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.700]   It feels like you're a bit of an outcast.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.500]   It feels like you're doing something wrong.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.580]   It feels like you're not where you should be, and that's an uncomfortable feeling for
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.960]   us as human beings.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.680]   And that kind of feeling was exactly how Mary and Joseph felt at that first Christmas.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.660]   They had been in Nazareth, a place where they were comfortable.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.340]   Nazareth, where there was a friendship and a community group around them.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.580]   Nazareth, where they worked.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.100]   They were working class people in a working class town, and that was comfortable for them.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.580]   But because of the census, they then had to go to Bethlehem.
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.580]   Now I don't know if you know much about this, but Nazareth, as described in Scripture, is
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.500]   like nothing good ever comes from there.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.820]   That's like a bad place.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.220]   Bethlehem, however, just being right next to Jerusalem, was actually much more affluent,
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.460]   much more a better place.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.680]   Now, it turns out that Joseph had relatives there, distant relatives, and because this
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.540]   census was happening, they had to uproot themselves and go to where they felt like they didn't
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.540]   belong.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.760]   And it must have been really uncomfortable for them to go like, "Okay, we're going to
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.120]   show up in this small kind of town of Bethlehem."
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.540]   That's a lot more upmarket than what we're used to, but it's okay, Joseph, because you
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.440]   got family there, and I guess the family are going to welcome us, and it'll be okay.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.040]   And they show up at Bethlehem, and the family don't welcome them.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.980]   In fact, all of Joseph's distant relatives want nothing to do with the fact that Mary
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.340]   is a pregnant teenage girl and is not married with Joseph, and the shame that would come
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.420]   on them if they accepted them into their family.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.440]   So all the doors were shut for them in Bethlehem.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.020]   And so what happens for Mary and Joseph is they actually end up having to give birth
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.340]   in this thing, what the Bible says is a stable, but actually what it was, and I've been to
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.260]   Bethlehem and I've visited some of these things.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.500]   They're like underground caves that were located under the houses in Bethlehem where the animals
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.060]   would go to keep warm during the winter.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:35.660]   And it's in one of these dark and damp caves that Mary gives birth to Jesus.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.660]   And this feeling of kind of not belonging, of being an outcast, is the central part of
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.620]   this Christmas story.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:48.500]   It's kind of the entry point, if you will, into understanding what's happening in that
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.020]   moment.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.660]   And perhaps you're sitting here today and this resonates a little bit with you.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.340]   Because perhaps you're sitting here and you're like, "I kind of get that because I feel like
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.780]   that a lot.
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.540]   I feel like I'm a little bit of an outsider, a little bit of an outcast.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.940]   I feel like sometimes I feel like I don't belong."
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.940]   Maybe some of you here, it's in your workplace.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.540]   You kind of feel like you don't really belong in your workplace.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.380]   You're not even sure how you kind of got there and you're not performing and you're not keeping
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.220]   up with everybody around you and it feels like you're going to get fired at some point
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.740]   soon and it feels awkward to you.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.060]   We can feel like this in our families even.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.860]   Some of us feel like a bit of an outcast in our families.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.260]   Maybe we didn't receive the embrace and love and welcome with our parents that we were
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.260]   hoping to feel.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.780]   And so family feels a bit strange for us.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.420]   Maybe it's just a relationship you're in.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.540]   It can impact many of us in many different ways.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.780]   Perhaps you're here today in this room or in the overflow or online or in some part
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.020]   of this building because somebody invited you to come to church on Christmas Day and
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.100]   you're feeling a little bit out of place here in this moment.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.660]   Maybe you feel like this is not a comfortable place for you.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.500]   Maybe this is the very first time you've ever been in church and you're not sure what to
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.420]   expect and there's weird videos about bubble pop.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.840]   And you're unsure about how to center yourself into this experience.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.100]   Maybe your parents invited you.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.140]   You've been dragged here as a kid.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.900]   Or maybe you're a kid who's invited your parents and you parents are here in this moment.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.980]   And it's not fitting for you.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.380]   It doesn't feel super comfortable.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:25.220]   Well, if you feel any way like that, whether here in this moment or in any part of your
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:31.140]   human experience, well, that's really good news for you because Christmas is exactly
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.820]   for people who feel that way.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.740]   Christmas was actually designed for the people who felt that way.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.140]   And trust me, I often feel that way.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.460]   Christmas is therefore for you and for me.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:50.180]   If Christmas says anything, it says all of us are invited.
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.060]   All of us belong.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:57.060]   That there are not some lounges and some VIP access that gets us in.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.100]   You are in.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.460]   You are welcomed in.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.020]   In fact, this is what the passage here says.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.940]   Let me read you verses 10 and 11 again.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.940]   I love this.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.260]   This is the angel speaking over shepherds to say, "But the angel said to them, 'Do not
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.660]   be afraid, for I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.300]   For today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.680]   He is the Christ, the Lord.'"
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.020]   These are beautiful verses because what's basically happening here is that the angels have shown
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.020]   up to shepherds to announce the arrival of Jesus.
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:36.900]   These are the first human beings that have ever heard about a literal life-changing moment
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.980]   that has taken place.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.580]   They're the first people to hear.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.580]   Think about this.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.660]   The shepherds are the first to hear.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.820]   Now, if you know anything about shepherds in the first century, this was not a highly
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.140]   sought-after job.
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.100]   Being a shepherd was...you became a shepherd either because you've kind of been passed
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.940]   it down over generations in your family or because you could not get any other job.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.100]   You would choose to be a shepherd because shepherds lived in the outside of society.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:09.060]   They spent a nomadic experience largely wandering around the Judean wilderness.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.140]   When I visited Israel a few years ago, I went to Bethlehem.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.000]   I experienced all of the kind of birth side, but then I also went outside of Bethlehem
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.540]   to see where these fields would have been.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.780]   And literally, you get just outside of Bethlehem in the West Bank and you're into this Judean
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.020]   wilderness area, and that's where they would have wandered with their sheep.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.940]   So these are people that live on their own away from everyone else.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.500]   And they're doing that, if you had chosen this in the first century, because you didn't
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.740]   fit in anywhere else.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.880]   You probably weren't welcomed where you were.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.640]   Maybe you'd done something that had put you on the outside of society, whatever it was,
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.340]   but you're a shepherd because you don't fit.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.340]   You're an outcast.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.500]   You're on the outside of everything.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.600]   You feel like you don't belong in Bethlehem or Jerusalem or whatever place, and so you've
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.140]   chosen a profession that keeps you away from everyone.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:03.900]   And it's the shepherds, these that are on the outside who feel they don't belong, that
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.140]   God decides to make that announcement.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.600]   Not to kings, queens, not to the emperor of Rome, not to the high flying, not to those
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:19.520]   in first class, but to those that are about as far away from it as possible, which should
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.360]   blow your mind.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.540]   That in choosing the shepherds to be the first to understand or hear about the birth of Jesus,
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.020]   God was making a bold and audacious claim.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.860]   He was saying, "What's about to happen in the birth and the life and the death and resurrection
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:43.460]   of Jesus is for those that need it the most, for the outcasts, for the broken, for the
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:49.980]   lonely, for the lost, for people just like you and me."
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.420]   That's the beauty of Christmas, that this wasn't a message that went out to the high
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.020]   flyers, the ones who thought they had earned that good news.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.060]   No, this came out to everybody.
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.240]   Notice actually what it says in the passage.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.420]   The angels declare this, "Hey, there's good news of great joy."
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.540]   Notice what they say, "For all the people."
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.540]   That's a beautiful thing.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.580]   They say it's for all the people.
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.740]   They don't say, "This is good news for some."
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:20.140]   They don't say, "This is good news for those that feel like they've earned that good news."
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.180]   They say, "Hey, this is the good news for those that feel like they're worthy of it
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.980]   or those that happen to kind of hear it."
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:33.300]   Now the angels say, "This is good news for all the people, for everyone.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.620]   For no matter how you might feel right now, it is good news.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.620]   No matter what you've done in your past, it is good news.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.020]   No matter what you might be doing right here and now, it is good news.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.540]   No matter how hopeful you are for your future, how scared about for your future, no matter
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.980]   how broken your past has been, no matter what you might be wrestling with right now, the
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.900]   beautiful thing of Christmas, it's for everyone.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.540]   Everyone gets invited.
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.740]   Everyone gets swept up.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.820]   It's not trying to say, "These are the special people and these ones aren't," which is a
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.940]   very important message for us Christians.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.940]   Hear this, church.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.900]   If you are a Christian here in this place, you need to hear this.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.660]   So often I think we Christians become arrogant about Christmas.
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.740]   We think Christmas is for us.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.060]   Christmas is my holiday.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.260]   Christmas is a Christian holiday.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.260]   Christmas is for us.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.780]   We are the ones that know about Jesus.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.660]   When we walk into that store and it's playing carols, we know that that's actually speaking
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.660]   about Jesus.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   This is our holiday.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.140]   We feel good about our holiday.
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.520]   Are you with me?
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.920]   We don't want to admit this, but we like this.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:42.020]   We have this sort of thought in our head that Christmas is only for Christian.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.380]   And the beautiful thing about the Christmas story is that the angels say, "No, no, no.
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.860]   This is not just for a certain select group of people who think they're better than others.
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.620]   This is for everyone."
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.780]   Christmas is a story that even the worst people, the poorest people, the down and outs, the
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:02.740]   outcasts, the ones who are struggling to make ends meet, this is what Christmas is about.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.540]   Christmas is good news for all of those people.
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.540]   And yes, it's also good news for those that are already in first class.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.980]   It's good news for us all.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:16.100]   Christmas is good news for the person who's recently divorced, who's struggling with the
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:21.620]   pain and the hurt of their divorce and wondering if they'll ever find love again.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:27.140]   Christmas is for the some 4,000 children who are currently in institutional care in Hong
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:32.560]   Kong right now, wondering if they'll ever find forever families.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.460]   Christmas is for the prostitute who just a few blocks from here is going to have to sell
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:42.180]   her body today in order to make ends meet.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:46.540]   Christmas is for the banker who's worried about their future because of the stock market
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.300]   and wondering whether they're going to keep their job in the new year.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.100]   Christmas is for the refugee and the asylum seeker who's here in Hong Kong struggling
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:01.300]   because the system in our city does not give them dignity, justice, or love.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.360]   Christmas is for you.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.720]   For you.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.340]   No matter what your background, no matter what you've done, no matter how you feel about
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.060]   yourself, whether you feel like you should be in relationship with God or whether you've
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.180]   not thought about God for years and someone's dragged you to church today, whatever it might
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.180]   be, Christmas is also for you.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.200]   This is good news for all the people.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.620]   And what is that good news?
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.620]   Notice what it says here.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.420]   It says, this is the angels again, it says, "For in the town of David," that's talking
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.140]   about Bethlehem, "a Savior has been born to you."
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.140]   I love this.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.740]   See, the angels don't say, "Hey, a child has been born to you."
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.820]   They don't say, "A really good human being has been born to you."
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.260]   They don't say, "A good moral thinker has been born to you."
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.540]   Nor do they say, "A great philosopher or a great human rights advocate has been born to
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.540]   you."
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.540]   They use a very important word.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.660]   They say, "A Savior has been born to you."
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.540]   This word Savior in the original text and it's linked to the Old Testament as well,
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:09.540]   the name basically means those who liberate or the one who liberates or delivers.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.700]   And the question we should ask is, what is it that we need deliberation or deliverance
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.700]   from?
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.220]   What do we need to be saved from?
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.980]   The beautiful thing about the Christian story, what the scriptures present to us is that
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:27.300]   the human condition is one where we all know, don't we, whether you believe in God or not,
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:32.380]   we all know that inside of us there's the propensity at times to do things that we're
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:37.580]   not proud of, things that are not good or healthy, whether for us or for others.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:43.300]   We've all experienced times where we've done broken things, wrong things, things that we're
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.660]   not proud of, things that we regret.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.020]   We know that we have done things where we've hurt the people that we've loved.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:55.940]   We know that sometimes our language or our actions or the decisions we make, later on
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:00.180]   we realize that that wasn't the best to bring a flourishing or a life for someone and that
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.360]   actually just brought more pain and hurt.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.500]   We all have experienced that.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.740]   That's the shared common human experience.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.420]   The Bible speaks of that in this idea of sin or just brokenness.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.740]   Now the human condition has this brokenness and we can't do anything ourselves to fix
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.740]   it.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.900]   It's not like we can suddenly kind of like get better at just trying to be a nicer person
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.860]   or try to fix that.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:28.020]   It's an ingrained, deeply part of who we are and we need someone outside of ourselves to
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.660]   come and to set things right.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:36.020]   The wonder of the Christmas story is that this child that was born in that dark, damp,
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:43.020]   smelly place is a sign to us that he can be born in the darkness of us as well.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:49.060]   It's a welcomed opportunity for us to realize that for all the people, for every single
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.900]   person who's struggling, who knows that they've done things that they're not proud of, they
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.340]   can receive a new relationship with God.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.820]   That's the beauty of what this salvation is all about.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.420]   It's not about just getting better as people.
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:08.300]   It's about being brought into a reconciled relationship with God.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:13.820]   Jesus would grow up and in his life and his death and his resurrection, he would stand
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:21.060]   in the gap for us who are in this broken relationship with God and say, "If you believe in me,
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:26.020]   if you recognize what I've done and if you open your heart to me, I can provide that
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:31.340]   reconciliation through the work of the death on cross and the resurrection afterwards to
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.700]   be back in relationship with him."
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.220]   That's all that's meant in this idea of the word Savior.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.180]   And the angels show up before Jesus has done anything.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.220]   Right now he's just probably thinking of bubble pop, right?
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.220]   He's like a kid.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.900]   He's a little defenseless, vulnerable child.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:55.100]   But even before he's done anything, the angels declare, "This is the one that will save you.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.180]   This is the one who can provide that reconciliation.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:04.620]   And it's got nothing to do with how good you think you are or even how bad you might feel.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.420]   It's a message and hope for you."
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.140]   And so on the other side, we should be thinking, "Well, how do I actually get back into this
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.740]   relationship with God?
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.740]   What is it that I can do to be in that reconciled relationship?"
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.380]   Well, unfortunately, it's got nothing to do with dinosaurs.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.460]   It's got nothing to do with cheetahs and lions or bubble pop or anything like that.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.740]   But it does have something to do with, "There is a light."
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:42.060]   This idea of light and grace, the idea that Jesus comes for us before we do anything,
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:45.580]   that in the grace of what he has done, we can respond to him.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.540]   There's this beautiful passage in Titus.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.980]   It's a book in the New Testament, Titus 2 verse 11.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.220]   Let me read this to you.
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:58.100]   It says, "For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people."
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.260]   Grace for every single one of us.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:04.900]   Grace means that you don't have to try to get better in order to meet with God.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.540]   Grace means that you don't have to try to earn some favor or try to live a better life
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.060]   in order to be back in relationship with God.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.660]   Grace means that everything for you to be back in relationship with him has already
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.580]   taken place.
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:23.500]   And we receive that grace through our open hearts of asking for him to forgive us and
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.860]   to move into relationship with him.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.140]   That's the good news that is for all people.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:35.620]   I don't know about you, but when I go to the airport, every single time I go to the airport,
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.660]   I pray for an upgrade.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.000]   Anyone else do that?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.880]   Come on Christians in the room.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.380]   And maybe some non-Christians here too.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.660]   Maybe you do it as well.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.660]   We go to the airport, don't we?
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.540]   And I'm like, "Jesus, Lord Jesus, this may be the day.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.060]   Oh, Lord, I love you so much and you've done so much for me.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.420]   Oh, worship your holy name."
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.740]   Now, if I could just get an upgrade today and I go up to the desk, you know, and I'm
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.460]   trying to be smiley and happy and I kind of hand my passport over and, you know, my economy
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.100]   class airline ticket, and I kind of smile at them and I go, "Any chance of an upgrade
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.600]   today?"
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.900]   I pray that prayer a lot.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.220]   Anyone else pray that prayer?
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.140]   Jesus has never answered that prayer in my life.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.060]   I just want you to know, never answered that prayer.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.860]   But here's one thing I do know.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:25.080]   There is a prayer, right, you can do right now that will immediately give you the only
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.620]   upgrade that is ever needed.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.540]   And that is your reconciled relationship with God.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.520]   That changes everything.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:39.140]   And that prayer, every single time it is prayed, reconciles us back to him, brings us into
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.500]   a place of salvation and grace.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.340]   And that's an upgrade that is worth everything.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:50.780]   And I wonder whether we might be able to pray for some of you today to receive that upgrade,
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.820]   a reconciled relationship with God.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.940]   Would you just close your eyes and bow your heads and I want to pray for you.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.780]   And if you've been listening to this message and this is connecting for you, maybe you
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:06.980]   do feel a little bit like you're an outsider, a little bit on the outskirts of things.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:12.500]   Maybe you feel that way with your family or in your workplace or in relationships.
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.220]   Maybe you feel that way even being here in this church community and in this church.
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.820]   You've always felt like you don't fit in.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.420]   You felt like you don't belong.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:25.200]   Well, Christmas is good news for you.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.900]   It's news for all people.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:39.140]   And that great idea of a Savior coming to the world to be born for you, to die for you,
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:44.500]   to be raised from the dead for you, so that you might be in a reconciled relationship
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.500]   with God.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.860]   That's the crux of what Christmas is all about.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.540]   That's the wonder and the beauty of a child that was born on this day.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:59.700]   Not just a moral philosopher, a Savior, the Son of God, Jesus Christ.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.280]   And so whilst your eyes are closed and your heads bowed, this is a chance for you to pray
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:10.180]   a prayer that will align you in faith and hope and belief back into that relationship
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.780]   with God through Jesus.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.180]   And we're going to pray this in a moment.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.500]   And if you pray this prayer for the first time, I want to encourage you to do something,
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.900]   and that is to share with the person who brought you to church today.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:26.420]   Or if you've come here on your own, and all our pastors are here around the building after
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.940]   the service, they're all wearing lanyards, we would love to connect with you and hear
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.940]   from you.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.500]   Because we want to tell you that life in Jesus is not just a prayer that you pray, but it's
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.300]   a lifestyle that's then walked out.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.660]   And we would love to help you begin your journey of walking out that lifestyle.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.420]   And so you can share with the person who brought you, or meet with one of our pastors after
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.420]   the service.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.900]   But as our eyes are closed, heads are bowed, we're all going to pray this prayer.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.860]   If you're a Christian here, pray it out loud.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.980]   And if you're wanting to pray this for the first time, pray it out loud as well.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:27:01.340]   And as we do so, we join together in the recognition that a Savior came for all of us.
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.340]   So let's pray.
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.940]   Lord Jesus, okay, we're going to start again.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.380]   And now you're going to pray louder, okay?
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:16.100]   Lord Jesus, I want to thank you for dying for me.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:28.500]   Here on Christmas Day in 2024, I'm grateful that I can get to know you and have a relationship
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.460]   with you.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:39.140]   I recognize that Christmas is for all people, and that includes me.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.500]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:49.740]   I ask that you would forgive me for all of the things I've done that have hurt you, that
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.980]   have hurt myself, that have hurt others.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:28:00.820]   And I thank you that you do forgive and bring me into new life.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:10.860]   And I ask today that you would give me in this moment your Spirit, your presence.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:21.180]   I ask for peace, for new life, and for your love to be known in me and through me.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.980]   And I pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:24.980]   Amen.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.620]   Can we put our hands together for anyone here who's prayed that prayer for the first time
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.620]   today?
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.580]   We're so grateful if you have.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.340]   Talk to the people that brought you.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.300]   Talk to us after the service.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.380]   We'd love to hear more, and we'd love to invite you into a life journey of getting to know
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.420]   Jesus more and more.
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.340]   It's the one thing that is the most beautiful, powerful thing.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.340]   I'm not going to promise that your life is suddenly going to be perfect, but I'm going
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.260]   to promise you that you will have a relationship with the one who created you, who can draw
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:55.700]   you into the flourishing of the way that He's always designed you to be.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.180]   And there's no better way to live than that.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.860]   Can we all stand together?
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:04.060]   And we're going to celebrate as we draw our service to a close.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:09.420]   We're going to celebrate this incredible message that we have that is for all the people, and
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.940]   we're going to do so through song of worship.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:18.140]   And as we do this, may I invite you to reflect on the goodness of God for Him in your life
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:23.940]   and for the joy that He's brought to you in 2024 as you prepare your hearts for all that's
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.940]   ahead.
