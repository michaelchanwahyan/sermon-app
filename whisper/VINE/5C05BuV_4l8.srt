1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
 So open our ears, open our hearts,

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,740
 and yeah, we just give you this time in Jesus' name, amen.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,840
 - Thank you, and no Christmas presents

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,360
 from Promise for me this year, okay?

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,320
 All right, well good morning, it's always good

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,060
 and an honor to be together when we gather on a Sunday.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,980
 Like Promise said, we are continuing our parable series.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,960
 Well I grew up in a Christian home,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,880
 you know, a third generation Christian family.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,440
 Both sides of my parents, you know,

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,400
 my parents were also Christian, so my mama, my popo,

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,600
 both made my parents in Christian homes,

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,840
 so you know, going to church, Christian things,

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,180
 all that stuff was a big part of growing up,

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,120
 especially praying before you eat, right?

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,840
 All this, and there was one particular prayer

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,640
 that I think most Cantonese-speaking little children

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,780
 learned or taught to pray before you eat, right?

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,000
 I would not, you know, especially if grandma was there,

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
 you would not dare to even touch the chopsticks

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,000
 before saying this prayer, okay?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,960
 It goes something like this.

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:10,120
 After you said that, then you could eat, okay?

25
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,120
 A translation would go something like this, okay?

26
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,040
 Sorry if that was triggering, by the way, all right?

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,020
 But basic translation would be something like this.

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,320
 Thank you God for this food, please bless it

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,560
 to give me a healthy body so I will listen

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,440
 and obey my parents, amen, okay?

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,420
 What listening to your parents and having to eat a meal

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,120
 has to do with, I don't know, but you know,

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,000
 they threw that in there just in case.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,200
 I do the same with my boys now, right, so.

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,800
 (audience laughing)

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,360
 So you know, being taught to pray

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,240
 was something we grew up with.

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,440
 Now of course, these days, my faith has matured,

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,840
 and hopefully, you know, my prayers sound a bit different.

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,800
 And what I've been realizing is that learning to pray,

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,280
 though, continuing to learn how to pray,

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,520
 it's such an important part of your journey with Jesus

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,920
 as you grow in faith.

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,100
 And as I said, as we continue our series

45
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,060
 in the parables today, the parable we're looking at today,

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,180
 Jesus uses a very peculiar, strange,

47
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,380
 almost sort of a humorous story

48
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,580
 to teach his followers about prayer.

49
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,860
 Now before he gets there, though,

50
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,580
 he teaches his disciples how to pray.

51
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,220
 One thing that's quite interesting to note in the gospels

52
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,100
 is that one of the only things that the disciples

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,980
 ask Jesus to teach them is to teach them about prayer.

54
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,700
 Lord, teach us how to pray.

55
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,180
 Why were they so keen to learn about what prayer is?

56
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,740
 Well, I reckon it's probably because, you know,

57
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,500
 after spending a lot of time with Jesus,

58
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,600
 you know, they did life together.

59
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,780
 They were together all the time.

60
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,500
 And so they would have definitely seen Jesus praying.

61
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,340
 Right, could you imagine what it would have been like

62
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,780
 to just sit in the presence of Jesus

63
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,160
 as he was praying to his heavenly Father?

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,300
 To hear the words that he would have said, right?

65
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,140
 The combination of intimacy and power,

66
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,820
 authority, vulnerability, and affirmation

67
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,340
 would have been so tangible in those moments, right?

68
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,340
 Prayer would have been such a active,

69
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,060
 such a beautiful thing as Jesus was speaking to his Father.

70
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,100
 And so as Jesus demonstrated how to pray to his disciples,

71
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,620
 they caught onto this.

72
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,740
 And so they ask him, Jesus, Lord, teach us how to pray.

73
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,500
 Luke 11 tells us this.

74
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,060
 One day, just as Jesus had finished praying

75
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,140
 in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him,

76
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,860
 Lord, teach us how to pray,

77
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,460
 just as John taught his disciples.

78
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,940
 And so Jesus teaches them.

79
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,660
 This is the disciples learning from the master himself.

80
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,160
 And what he teaches isn't just some, you know,

81
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,700
 some, you know, cheap, cutesy little prayer

82
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,140
 you say before you eat.

83
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,420
 But this is a prayer that shaken the whole entire world.

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,820
 It's a prayer that's provided comfort and guidance

85
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,580
 and power for believers over the past 2,000 years

86
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,780
 and continues to do so today.

87
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,780
 This prayer has become a distinctive mark

88
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,300
 of what it means to be a follower of Jesus.

89
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,940
 And we often call it the Lord's Prayer,

90
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,740
 but I think actually a more appropriate name

91
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,240
 for it would be the Disciples' Prayer,

92
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,140
 because this is how Jesus taught his disciples,

93
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,820
 his followers, which means us in this room today,

94
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,320
 those of you who've given your life to Jesus,

95
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,740
 this is our prayer to him.

96
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,020
 This is a prayer that sits at the very heart

97
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,640
 of every body of Christ.

98
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,760
 So what did Jesus teach him?

99
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,280
 What are these words?

100
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,520
 Jesus said to them, he said this,

101
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,480
 when you pray, say, Father, hallowed be your name.

102
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,600
 Your kingdom come, give us each day our daily bread,

103
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,800
 forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone

104
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,000
 who sins against us, and lead us not into temptation.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,120
 Now we could spend a whole other sermon series

106
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,240
 unpacking this prayer, seeing all the implications,

107
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,880
 but for today, I just want to highlight

108
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,060
 a few key concepts before we move on to the next part.

109
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,840
 Notice this, Jesus starts by addressing God as Father.

110
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,880
 What Jesus is doing here is he teaches us

111
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,880
 the primary way we are to relate to God is as a father.

112
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,480
 Now of course, this begs the question,

113
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,520
 what kind of a father is God?

114
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,780
 Because when it comes to our experiences

115
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,720
 with our earthly fathers, probably a lot of us

116
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,120
 in this room, many of us in this room

117
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,360
 will have different experience.

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,380
 Some of us have probably a great relationship

119
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,220
 with our fathers.

120
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,720
 Our fathers were there for us,

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,200
 they were our biggest cheerleaders,

122
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,280
 supporters, provided for us.

123
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,820
 That's a good father.

124
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,240
 But maybe some of us grew up with absent fathers.

125
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,200
 We never knew our dad, or maybe perhaps even a father

126
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,600
 that was mean or abusive to us in many different ways.

127
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,420
 Now of course, what Jesus wants to highlight

128
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,460
 is that God is the perfect father, the good father,

129
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,100
 the father who'd give good gifts,

130
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,620
 and we're gonna talk a bit more about this in a minute,

131
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,360
 but God is our father.

132
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,220
 Jesus wants to remind us of this.

133
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,920
 Then he says this, "Hallowed be your name.

134
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,680
 "Your kingdom come."

135
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
 What Jesus is trying to highlight here

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,840
 is trying to teach us that prayer

137
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,880
 is something bigger than ourselves.

138
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,280
 Prayer is about acknowledging who God is,

139
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,160
 that he is the creator of this world.

140
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,360
 He is the one who's holy.

141
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,320
 He is the one who set apart.

142
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,620
 And prayer is also about knowing that the ultimate purpose

143
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,120
 of Jesus coming to this earth,

144
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,380
 the ultimate purpose of what God is trying to do right now

145
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,760
 is to bring his kingdom here on this earth,

146
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,840
 to announce that Jesus is returning,

147
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,200
 to announce that God's kingdom is available

148
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,540
 to those who put their trust in him.

149
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,020
 Next he tells us this, "Give us each day our daily bread."

150
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,560
 This is Jesus acknowledging God as our perfect provider.

151
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,940
 It's actually Jesus sort of making a link

152
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,600
 all the way back to Exodus.

153
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,000
 Remember in Exodus when the Israelites were leading,

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,280
 being led out of Egypt into the desert,

155
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,200
 into the promised land?

156
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,040
 Before they got there,

157
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,160
 they were wandering around in the desert.

158
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,100
 And what did God provide for them each and every single day?

159
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,020
 Exactly what they needed, daily bread, provision for them.

160
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,560
 Jesus knows exactly what we need.

161
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,360
 He is our provider.

162
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,400
 Jesus reminds us of that.

163
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,800
 So we can ask him for things.

164
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,560
 And we're gonna talk a bit more about that

165
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,520
 in a minute as well.

166
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,280
 Then he says this, "Forgive our sins.

167
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,600
 "Forgive everyone who sins against us."

168
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,040
 What Jesus is trying to highlight here

169
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,640
 is he's trying to remind us that prayer

170
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,280
 is also about building a relationship with God

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,800
 and about us building a relationship with each other.

172
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,340
 You see, asking for forgiveness

173
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,360
 and being met with love and mercy

174
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,160
 is one of the greatest privileges we have

175
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,740
 as children of God, with God as our father.

176
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,320
 That every time we come to him and ask for forgiveness

177
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,060
 and we repent and we come to him and we say,

178
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,540
 "Lord, I'm sorry.

179
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,380
 "Forgive me.

180
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,580
 "I want to do better."

181
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,260
 We are met with love and forgiveness and mercy.

182
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,500
 That's God's heart for us.

183
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,320
 And without that,

184
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,340
 without God offering his forgiveness to us,

185
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,780
 without Jesus dying on the cross

186
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,060
 and his blood being poured out,

187
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,640
 there would be no forgiveness of sins.

188
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,540
 There would be no relationship.

189
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,220
 But because there is,

190
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
 we can have a relationship with God.

191
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,660
 Prayer is about relationship.

192
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,460
 And it's the same with each other.

193
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,020
 If we were always sinning against each other

194
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,500
 but never forgiving each other,

195
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,240
 that would lead to a breakdown in relationship as well.

196
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,580
 There would be no community

197
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,720
 without the forgiveness of sins with each other.

198
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,940
 Finally, he says this, "Lead us not into temptation."

199
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,040
 Prayer is also about acknowledging the need

200
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,360
 for God's help in our spiritual battles.

201
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,800
 We've been reminded a few times throughout this series

202
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,760
 and in recent weeks that spiritual battles

203
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
 are a part of everyday life.

204
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
 That we have an enemy trying to distract us,

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,600
 trying to destroy our relationship with Jesus.

206
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,560
 And prayer is one of the key ways,

207
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,640
 one of the best weapons we have

208
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,900
 against the schemes of the enemy.

209
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,560
 So we pray for God to protect us from evil,

210
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,540
 keep us away from temptation and sin.

211
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,240
 But there's one more thing that's important for us today.

212
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,840
 Notice that throughout the prayer, right,

213
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,880
 it's the use of plural that Jesus uses.

214
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
 It's talking about us.

215
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
 Give us this day our daily bread.

216
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,260
 Give us, give us, give us.

217
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,040
 What Jesus is trying to remind us is that

218
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,100
 prayer is actually about the community coming together.

219
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,660
 It's not just our relationship with God,

220
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,000
 it's our relationship with each other as well.

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
 So how do we build friendship?

222
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,640
 How do we build community?

223
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,980
 How do we take this prayer and apply it to our lives?

224
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,340
 And so with that being said, to continue our time together,

225
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,440
 I'm gonna invite some friends up on the stage

226
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,400
 to share the next part of this message with us.

227
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,000
 So let's welcome Emma, Jethro, and Phil.

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,840
 Where's Phil?

229
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,680
 All right, there we go.

230
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,480
 Okay, let's give them a big round of applause.

231
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
 (audience applauding)

232
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,680
 ♪ No one told you life was gonna be this way ♪

233
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,120
 ♪ You're gonna have to try ♪

234
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,440
 - Si got the message.

235
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,960
 Good, okay.

236
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,960
 Emma was thrown off by that this morning.

237
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,440
 It's the best show on TV, I have to say.

238
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
 Even after all these years,

239
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,840
 any time I put on Friends, it's always entertaining.

240
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,760
 I'm super excited to be together today,

241
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,160
 to be able to do this, and we've been talking about this

242
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,120
 and planning this for a while.

243
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
 Emma and Jethro, as you would have seen regularly

244
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,240
 on the stage, they lead us in worship week in and week out,

245
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,000
 but ahead of their heart and their skills and their talent

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,120
 for leading worship and their musicality,

247
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,760
 which probably two of the best worship leaders,

248
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,120
 if not in Hong Kong, maybe even the world, I would say.

249
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,680
 I'm not biased or anything.

250
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,680
 But it's really their heart for Jesus

251
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,800
 and their seriousness about their faith,

252
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,920
 their passion for the Lord that really shapes them

253
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,760
 as who they are.

254
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,920
 So I'm really appreciative of Emma and Jethro.

255
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,680
 And Phil, I'm not sure what Phil's doing here, but.

256
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,520
 (audience laughing)

257
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,360
 Phil leads our young adults.

258
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,840
 Those of you who've been baptized

259
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,360
 would have sat under his teaching in baptism as well.

260
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,960
 Phil is one of those guys who,

261
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,600
 when everyone else is being silly, right?

262
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,640
 Phil's in the office reading his Bible,

263
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,000
 knows in the Bible, taking notes, doing all this stuff.

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,720
 He has a heart of pure gold.

265
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,220
 I would trust Phil with my life, with everything.

266
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,440
 So I'm really glad to call him a friend as well.

267
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
 So, we've heard me talk.

268
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,520
 We started with talking about the Lord's Prayer,

269
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,480
 and that sort of sets up the tone

270
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,640
 for the conversation we wanna have today.

271
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,240
 But the parable we are looking at

272
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,800
 is called the parable of the friend at midnight.

273
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,840
 And so perhaps if you wanna start us, Phil,

274
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,240
 if you could read the parable to us,

275
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,520
 and we'll take the conversation on from there.

276
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,160
 - Yeah, so it starts from verse five.

277
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,920
 And Jesus said to them, "Suppose you have a friend,

278
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 and you go to him at midnight and say,

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,360
 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread.

280
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,800
 A friend of mine on a journey has come to me,

281
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,000
 and I have no food to offer him.'

282
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,740
 And suppose the one inside answers,

283
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,440
 'Don't bother me, the door is already locked,

284
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,680
 and my children and I are in bed.

285
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,480
 I can't get up and give you anything.'

286
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,280
 I tell you, even though he will not get up

287
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,780
 and give you the bread because of friendship,

288
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,640
 yet because of your shameless audacity,

289
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,480
 he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.

290
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,840
 And so I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you.

291
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,080
 Seek, and you will find.

292
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,360
 Knock, and a door will be opened to you.

293
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,860
 For everyone who asks receives,

294
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,940
 the one who seeks finds,

295
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,760
 and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened."

296
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,600
 - Yeah, thanks, Phil.

297
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,080
 So, you know, as we've been realizing through the parables,

298
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,840
 right, it's always a very vivid imagery.

299
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,680
 You can imagine this being played out like a movie, right,

300
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,940
 like a scene that's being described very vividly,

301
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,120
 all the characters, all the stories.

302
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,240
 But it's often easy, you know,

303
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,760
 I think I find parables easy to understand sometimes

304
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,800
 if we sort of put it into our own context, right,

305
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,480
 insert ourselves into the story.

306
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,240
 So, Phil, let's say, for example,

307
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,040
 this happened to you, all right?

308
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,680
 It's just been, it's been Saturday night,

309
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,480
 you know, 180 is over, you've been there all night,

310
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,940
 you've been posturing people, you're tired,

311
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,880
 you go home, you know, Cyril's still awake,

312
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,400
 so you had to put Cyril to sleep,

313
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,960
 and, you know, he was really hard to put to sleep,

314
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,040
 and you finally, everything is nice and quiet,

315
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,600
 and then suddenly, Jethro, you know,

316
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,760
 comes up and starts knocking on your door.

317
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,680
 Yeah, what would you do in that situation?

318
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,620
 - Saturday is probably the worst day

319
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,360
 to look for me after 180,

320
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,320
 and I'm sorry, Jethro, I like you a lot,

321
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,320
 you are the nicest person, but I will get super annoyed,

322
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,320
 and I will make up lots of excuses to make you go away.

323
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,640
 - Yeah. (audience laughing)

324
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,800
 Fair enough, fair enough, right,

325
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,280
 I would probably do the same, right,

326
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,360
 like the goal, right, to knock on someone's door

327
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,560
 at midnight to ask for something bread, you know,

328
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,840
 I think in the context of the story,

329
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,360
 it would have been even more annoying,

330
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,720
 because back then, houses were just one big room,

331
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,520
 and so everybody would have been sleeping

332
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,980
 on the floor together in, like, the living area,

333
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,280
 and apparently, you know, there were, like,

334
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,400
 the way the doors were made,

335
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,480
 it just made a lot of noise to open the door,

336
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,800
 all this kind of stuff would have been hugely annoying,

337
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,180
 the children would definitely have been woken up, right,

338
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,460
 this isn't even asking for the friend for himself,

339
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,120
 it's a friend of a friend who's come to visit,

340
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,320
 like, what's, you know, why are you bothering with this man?

341
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,200
 Right, so it's just hugely annoying,

342
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,200
 completely unreasonable, and so you wouldn't expect

343
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,640
 a reasonable response, right, you would expect Phil

344
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,540
 or anyone else in their right mind to be like,

345
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,680
 go away, you know, stop bugging me, come back tomorrow,

346
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,760
 or, you know, I'm not talking to you right now,

347
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,480
 put the phone on do not disturb, right,

348
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,980
 and just leave it at that, which is precisely

349
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,980
 why this story is so weird, because that is not

350
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,440
 the response that this person is faced with, right,

351
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,500
 you would think it would end by saying, go away,

352
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,200
 but it's not, right, in the end, the person who asks

353
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,540
 gets what he needs, and gets what he asked for in the end,

354
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,600
 so, you know, why do you think Jesus tells this story

355
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
 in this way, right, it's kind of weird,

356
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,280
 it's kind of doesn't make sense to us.

357
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,040
 - Yeah, it is pretty weird, and I mean,

358
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,400
 the scripture does say it kind of low-key validates

359
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,880
 your shadiness, 'cause it's like, you know,

360
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,480
 the friend is like, no, you can go away now,

361
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,620
 we're sleeping, I'll find you some other time,

362
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,200
 but verse eight, actually, Jesus highlights that,

363
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,960
 even though the friend doesn't get up to help

364
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,660
 out of a desire to be a good friend or whatever,

365
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,660
 he does, indeed, eventually get up, and it reads,

366
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,020
 even though he will not get up and give you the bread

367
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,260
 because of friendship, yet because of your shameless

368
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,220
 audacity, he will surely get up and give you

369
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,780
 as much as you need, and as we were kind of reading

370
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,060
 through this, I was looking at that phrase,

371
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,400
 shameless audacity, and I was pulling out, like,

372
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,420
 different translations of the Bible, 'cause they always

373
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,820
 have, like, different words of it, so that's just

374
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,660
 a good tip if you're reading your Bible,

375
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,100
 and there's a part that's interesting or weird,

376
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,420
 just look at other translations to get a sense

377
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,580
 of what the full meaning of the word is,

378
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,880
 but anyway, I was doing that, and different versions

379
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,100
 have different words for that, so shameless audacity,

380
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,620
 persistence,

381
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,280
 boldness,

382
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,380
 a number of other words that are, like, SAT words,

383
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,300
 too fancy for me, and I can't remember,

384
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,800
 but the sense of it is this notion of someone

385
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,480
 who's so persistent to the point of annoyance,

386
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,260
 so think of, like, the picture of a kid who's like,

387
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,560
 dad, can we have ice cream for dinner,

388
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
 can we have ice cream for dinner,

389
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,420
 can we have ice cream for dinner, are we there yet,

390
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,860
 you know, like, that consistent push,

391
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,620
 and I think the first thing that that taught me,

392
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,300
 or that I, that that highlighted for me

393
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,620
 about what Jesus is teaching his disciples about prayer

394
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,220
 is just having the audacity to ask,

395
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,300
 like, daring to approach him at all.

396
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,640
 In this story, the scenario really doesn't make sense,

397
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,460
 it takes shameless audacity because it just doesn't

398
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,180
 make sense to bother someone at midnight

399
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,820
 for three loaves of bread, like, the situation

400
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,900
 doesn't make sense, the request doesn't seem proportional,

401
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,220
 you can really wait a couple more hours

402
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,780
 and find me when the sun rises, like,

403
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,100
 it's not that far away from, like, 5 a.m.,

404
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,260
 when probably they would've been up,

405
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,340
 but it's just Jesus encouraging them,

406
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,260
 when it doesn't seem like it's important enough,

407
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,980
 when the circumstances are not favorable,

408
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,340
 when it seems like it'll be too mafan to do it,

409
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,780
 do it anyway, right, like, the, just he,

410
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,180
 first he's just inviting them and encouraging them

411
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,700
 to come, have the audacity to come.

412
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,180
 But then the second thing I realized,

413
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,340
 I went further into my rabbit hole of, like,

414
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,220
 translations and what actually do you mean

415
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,540
 shameless audacity and fell on the Greek bandwagon,

416
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,340
 and I don't speak Greek, so just looking at scholars

417
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,180
 who were looking at that phrase, and it turns out

418
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,180
 that another way you could interpret the sentence,

419
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,580
 in this version it says, because of your shameless audacity

420
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,220
 you will surely get up, but another way to interpret

421
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,900
 that phrase is to say, because the person doesn't wanna

422
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,020
 be put to shame, they will get up.

423
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,540
 So kind of the sense of, they didn't wanna lose face,

424
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,820
 and so they end up, even though they don't want to

425
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,220
 and don't feel like it, they get up.

426
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,500
 Now, God, what I'm not saying is that's how God thinks,

427
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,980
 and we'll get to that later, that's not necessarily God,

428
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,940
 but I think what this did remind me of is how,

429
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,300
 in scripture, when people approach God,

430
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,860
 often they approached him on the basis of his character,

431
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,420
 rather than their own persistence.

432
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,700
 So you have Moses, when he's interceding,

433
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,980
 and God is like, I'm just gonna wipe everybody out,

434
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,900
 we're gonna start over, they're not my people,

435
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,340
 forget about them, and Moses is like, cool, cool, cool, cool,

436
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,400
 but what are people gonna say about you?

437
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,940
 What are they gonna say about you bringing these people

438
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,100
 all the way here, are they gonna say that you weren't

439
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,500
 able to keep them, so you killed them all off?

440
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,420
 So that intercession moment wasn't really about

441
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,140
 Moses being so deep and so good, even,

442
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,900
 or so kind that he could intercede for others,

443
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,700
 it was about him understanding the character of God

444
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,700
 and saying, yeah, but these people represent you,

445
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,920
 so what does this say about you?

446
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,940
 Similarly, in later times, when David is praying,

447
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,260
 he says, have mercy on me, not because I deserve it,

448
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,580
 but out of your unfailing love.

449
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,920
 So this second kind of facet of approaching prayer

450
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,720
 based on who God is, and that making up the foundation,

451
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,740
 that giving us the courage, even if we're not there,

452
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,940
 he is, that we can approach him.

453
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,780
 - Yeah, I think one good thing to remember is,

454
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,220
 you know, the nature, why Jesus told stories in parables

455
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,780
 was because often there was like this subversive message

456
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,500
 behind what he was trying to say, and so the idea

457
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,860
 of approaching God with shameless audacity,

458
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,740
 just approaching him, would have been completely

459
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,400
 countercultural to what people were used to at the time,

460
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,380
 with sacrifices and all these rituals you had to go to

461
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,880
 before you could enter the temple and all this kind of stuff

462
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,120
 but what Jesus is saying, no, just go up to him,

463
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,800
 just approach him, it's fine, you know,

464
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,840
 because of his character, we can go to him

465
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,120
 with the things that we need.

466
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,080
 Now, of course, that grows out to the other part,

467
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,900
 the other side of that coin is, now, when we do go to him

468
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,360
 with things we need, right, when we ask him for these

469
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,480
 crazy, shameless, you know, things that we are,

470
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,840
 like we seem to be, that seem to be unreasonable,

471
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,320
 when we go to God with these kind of requests,

472
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,960
 what kind of response can we expect to have from him?

473
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,900
 And I know, you know, Jethro, you, Phil, also have

474
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,820
 had those sort of experiences where you've gone to God

475
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,120
 with something, something ridiculous,

476
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,820
 and you've prayed about it, and in those times,

477
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,860
 you know, how do you feel like God has responded to you?

478
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,860
 >> Yeah, I think Phil's example is a more serious example.

479
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,740
 Well, so mine was a few years, quite a few years back.

480
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,420
 The background is my family having a financial situation,

481
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,860
 a hardship, and because I was reading the Bible,

482
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,340
 and then this part, right, 'cause he says,

483
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,920
 "Ask and it will be given to you."

484
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,700
 And then so I was thinking, okay, I need money.

485
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,580
 And not just me, right, like my family needs money.

486
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,340
 So I was asking God for $1 million.

487
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,860
 Like, you guys are like, "What, is that serious?"

488
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,180
 But I was genuinely serious at that point, like,

489
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,660
 Lord, can you ask, I'm asking for $1 million, can you,

490
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,820
 'cause you know you hear stories of people

491
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,940
 receiving mysterious money, and suddenly your bank account

492
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,500
 grows a few zeros, and that's what I was expecting.

493
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,360
 So there was a period in my life where whenever I go

494
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,620
 to the ATM and I plug in my card, put in the pin,

495
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,700
 and I was like, is this the same?

496
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,140
 Yeah, it's still the same.

497
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,300
 $1 million's not there yet.

498
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,820
 >> But after you get married, it's like the opposite.

499
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,580
 It just keeps going down and down and down.

500
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,980
 Okay, carry on, sorry.

501
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,020
 >> Noted, noted.

502
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,620
 >> He's getting ready, so anyway.

503
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:32,180
 >> No, but then like, I think that I was genuinely asking,

504
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,900
 because God says, like Emma said, like, you're asking

505
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,180
 not because of your persistence,

506
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,020
 but because of what God has said, right?

507
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,580
 And clearly He said, "Ask, and it will be given to you."

508
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,380
 So I'm like, Lord, you said this,

509
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,940
 and so now I'm asking you, right?

510
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,260
 So if I don't ask, He won't give.

511
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,660
 >> What was that, you miss the shots?

512
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,940
 You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

513
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,080
 >> Yeah, yeah, that's right, yeah.

514
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,940
 >> But He didn't give me, He hasn't given me yet.

515
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,980
 But I think throughout the process,

516
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,420
 like I wasn't just asking,

517
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,500
 I was genuinely listening to His answers.

518
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,220
 I was asking, Lord, if like, I genuinely need

519
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,900
 like your support, your provision,

520
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,520
 we need like as a family, but then how are you

521
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,480
 going to provide, and not by that one million instant money,

522
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,720
 but I think throughout that period,

523
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,540
 He's teaching me like, okay, He's put people around me,

524
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,280
 He's put circumstances around me.

525
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,960
 I have, I think at that time I was looking for a job,

526
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,700
 and then I got a job.

527
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,920
 So like, you know, those things are His answers

528
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,080
 to my question of, to my actually deeper question,

529
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,440
 Lord, will you provide?

530
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,880
 It's not actually about the one million,

531
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,280
 but if I didn't ask for the one million dollars

532
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,900
 that seemed ridiculous, I wouldn't have gotten

533
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,040
 to the point where I'm actually coming to God

534
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,960
 with a need, like a vulnerability,

535
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,080
 like Lord, I need you to provide, I need you to come through.

536
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,280
 So yeah, I think the way that He answers is different,

537
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,200
 and, but you don't get to that answer until you ask.

538
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,800
 So yeah, what about you, Phil?

539
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,080
 >> Yeah, I can relate to, well, I like to call it

540
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,000
 unanswered prayers, because in my situation,

541
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,880
 as many of you might know, I have a chronic health condition

542
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,020
 and so I pray about it every day.

543
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,720
 My wife, Chris, prays about it.

544
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,760
 The staff team, we've all prayed about it.

545
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,760
 And the awkward elephant is that He has heard the prayer

546
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,440
 and decided to kind of leave me hanging.

547
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,380
 And that kind of creates this, just not wanting

548
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,240
 to kind of come to Him.

549
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,040
 And I struggle in the area of kind of unanswered prayers

550
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,560
 a lot, and if I even talk about it a little bit more,

551
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,880
 it gets very dangerous when it starts to,

552
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,640
 when I make it about me, when I think,

553
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,760
 actually, He's not healing, He's not doing something.

554
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,660
 He doesn't love me.

555
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,300
 And so paradoxically, actually, to get out of this trouble,

556
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,420
 to stay away from trouble, it's to ask even more,

557
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,980
 it's to pray even more.

558
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,900
 And over the 30 years of having eczema

559
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,220
 and praying about it every day, I've realized that,

560
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,620
 actually, I need Him more than I need Him to heal me

561
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,300
 and meet my health need.

562
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,820
 And prayer just kind of takes me away

563
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,140
 from the center of the universe, the sense of existence,

564
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,560
 and it puts God back into the center of existence.

565
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,860
 - You know, that's really good, Phil.

566
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,860
 I think both Jethro and Phil sharing from their experiences,

567
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,540
 Phil, going back to the Lord's Prayer, right?

568
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,740
 God has provided, that your daily bread,

569
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,700
 you're sitting here today speaking to us,

570
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,460
 each and every single step of the way, God has provided.

571
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,880
 I know, Phil, in your struggles, I was with you

572
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,380
 in the hospital some of those times

573
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,340
 when those flare-ups were just so unbearable.

574
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,660
 But to be sitting here today again, right,

575
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,980
 and we're still praying as a staff.

576
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,300
 I pray for you sometimes, you know,

577
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,380
 maybe not as often as I should,

578
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,420
 but when God reminds me, I do pray for you,

579
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,740
 and people are praying for you.

580
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,740
 So that's an ongoing thing we have, right,

581
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,460
 in our relationship with each other

582
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,700
 and in our relationship with God as well.

583
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,660
 But I think often, going back to what we were talking about

584
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,440
 before as well, there are things that sort of,

585
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,160
 and maybe you guys can relate too,

586
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,720
 things that sort of stop us from taking that first step

587
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,620
 in the first place, right,

588
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,080
 to actually ask God for something.

589
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,000
 You know, can I ask God about this?

590
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,340
 You know, will He even listen?

591
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,920
 Is this too big or too small?

592
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,960
 And maybe, Emma, you could share a bit more

593
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,120
 about your thoughts on what are some of those things

594
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,400
 that stop us from initially even engaging with God

595
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,260
 in that conversation of asking about something for prayer,

596
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,760
 in prayer? - Yeah.

597
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,260
 I'm sure there's like a million things we can come up with.

598
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,940
 I can think of like four or five.

599
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,100
 I think the first thing is the,

600
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,980
 we are a people, as a generation,

601
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,320
 I think that are in our head a lot more

602
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,780
 than maybe generations before us,

603
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,020
 so we plan a lot, we live here quite a bit.

604
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,960
 And so I think a lot of the times,

605
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,900
 one obstacle to prayer that's super simple

606
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,160
 is just you think about it and you don't do it.

607
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,040
 Like, you just, you don't, like, you're like,

608
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,760
 oh, yeah, I'll pray about that.

609
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,740
 And then life happens and kids and whatever,

610
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,580
 and then you forget.

611
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,200
 I remember we had a staff d'evil on Tuesday

612
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,800
 and I was in the middle of singing a song,

613
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,420
 and as I'm singing a song, I'm reminded of,

614
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,300
 I see a colleague and I'm reminded of a need they have

615
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,820
 and I make a mental note, like, okay, you know,

616
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,400
 in mid-song, like, I will shout for them,

617
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,000
 yeah, I'll pray for them, you know,

618
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,040
 maybe after this song, after this moment.

619
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,840
 And I remember the Holy Spirit reminding me,

620
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,340
 actually, you can pray now.

621
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,600
 You're talking to me now about how you're gonna do

622
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,480
 this later, so why don't you just do it

623
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,760
 while you're talking about it?

624
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,240
 So I think this, like, there's a sense of urgency

625
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,420
 and immediacy to prayer.

626
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,200
 We tend to think, we like to do things

627
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,400
 after we've thought through all of the steps

628
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,840
 and we've come up with all of the best ways to do it,

629
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,780
 and with prayer, it really is something

630
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,600
 that you learn as you do it.

631
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,720
 And so instead of planning to pray, pray, right?

632
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,240
 Like, that's a better use of time than to say,

633
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,080
 the three minutes it takes you to write down,

634
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,540
 like, oh, what is that request?

635
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,660
 Like, you really can pray at any time,

636
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,100
 in the midst of any situation.

637
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,700
 So that's probably one.

638
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,700
 Another one would be that we don't think we need him, right?

639
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,660
 Technology is really good.

640
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,920
 We're not at the place in the world or in history

641
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,860
 where you need the Lord for clean water.

642
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,620
 Like, you don't have to pray for your water

643
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,980
 to be poison-free.

644
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,940
 And so we think, mistakenly, I think,

645
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,480
 that because we are not as aware of our need of him,

646
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,340
 that our need has lessened.

647
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,740
 And so, you know, he's strengthened,

648
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,740
 and it is his provision that there are less tangible needs,

649
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,540
 but we need him no less.

650
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,100
 So I think to those of us that sometimes feel like,

651
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,900
 actually, I'm pretty good, I'm doing okay,

652
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,460
 and I'm not really reminded of how much I need him,

653
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,940
 I'm not in a dire situation,

654
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,500
 I think he would say, without me, you can do nothing.

655
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,700
 Absolutely nothing.

656
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,660
 So like, not like you can do some things

657
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,420
 or you can do a little bit of things, right?

658
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,720
 And it's just, it's that working up that muscle

659
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,360
 to be reminded that we need him.

660
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,760
 I think another reason is that we are afraid

661
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,680
 'cause whatever we're asking for help for,

662
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,120
 we got ourselves in that situation.

663
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,320
 Maybe he told you not to do it, and you did it anyway,

664
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,600
 and now you're in this situation,

665
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,280
 and you're like, ah, it's kind of awkward

666
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,240
 to go back to you now.

667
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,560
 But what we heard last week, that parable

668
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,980
 about a father who's open and who's waiting,

669
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,920
 and I don't think there's a parent here

670
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,140
 whose child, having gone as far away as possible,

671
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,120
 turns and goes back to them, who would be like,

672
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,880
 nah, you went too far.

673
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,240
 Like, whatever condition you're in, when you turn,

674
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,720
 that you turn, is what he cares about,

675
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,820
 it's what he wants, right?

676
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,520
 And then I think another thing is,

677
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,000
 we might actually doubt, like, can he do it?

678
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,080
 What's this gonna change?

679
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,920
 And to that, I'm reminded of the father

680
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,680
 who asked Jesus to heal his son,

681
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,860
 and he ends up praying, and his prayer is,

682
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,900
 I believe, but help my unbelief.

683
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,600
 So it's okay, even if I'm not sure.

684
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,980
 If I'm like, yeah, they said Jesus might heal,

685
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,100
 but maybe he won't, and I don't know if he will,

686
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,260
 so I'm just not gonna bother.

687
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,940
 Still coming to him.

688
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,220
 And then the biggest one, I think, for me,

689
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,460
 that I think, in terms of where we are in Hong Kong,

690
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,100
 and just as a, I don't know, generation of people,

691
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,100
 is the fear of being a burden is such a big, big hurdle

692
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,800
 for people when it comes to bringing our needs

693
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,160
 to one another and to God.

694
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,060
 I have not met a people that are so stuck

695
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,240
 on being self-sufficient, like we are,

696
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,480
 generally as this generation,

697
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,120
 but also Hong Kong is like, next, next.

698
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,300
 Like, it's like, you know, love the Lord your God,

699
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,560
 and then don't be mafan.

700
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,600
 That's how the commandments work here.

701
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,280
 We really hate feeling like we're imposing

702
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,980
 or being a burden on one another.

703
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,580
 We can't stand the notion of,

704
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,220
 ah, what are people gonna think?

705
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,080
 And I think that becomes something we carry,

706
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,860
 maybe subconsciously with us, into a relationship with God,

707
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,140
 where it's like, ah, that's gonna be bothersome.

708
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,860
 Oh, that's gonna be, you know, he's gonna not,

709
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,940
 it's gonna bother him.

710
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,040
 And I think there it's really helpful

711
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,080
 that he is not actually the grumpy friend

712
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,080
 that is annoyed with us at midnight, right?

713
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,920
 He's a father.

714
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,920
 >> Yeah, if I can add on to the self-sufficiency nature

715
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,160
 of why we don't tend to pray.

716
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,080
 Another one, it's, you know,

717
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,000
 as self-preservation creatures,

718
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,440
 we love to self-preserve in a way

719
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,520
 where we don't want to further humiliate ourselves

720
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,820
 when we've been turned down the first time.

721
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,940
 And so what we do is, you know, we don't ask anymore.

722
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,140
 And yet, Jesus teaching about this shameless audacity,

723
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,100
 he's actually not just teaching it,

724
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,540
 but he models it himself.

725
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,540
 If we think about the prayers that he did near his death,

726
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,580
 the one at the Mount Olives,

727
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,100
 Father, if you're willing, could you take away that cop?

728
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,740
 That blows my mind.

729
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,460
 Another one to really think about, you know,

730
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,200
 the one on the cross,

731
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
 Father, forgive them for they didn't know

732
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,120
 what they were doing.

733
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,600
 That shameless audacity, that is, you know,

734
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,600
 being so vulnerable at the cost of being humiliated by all.

735
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,520
 And so he is modeling us something

736
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,120
 that he could do himself,

737
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,660
 and it proves to us that we could also do it.

738
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,280
 And he could do it so well

739
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,240
 because he knows the Father's heart.

740
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,140
 And I think that would be the direction we ought to take.

741
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,560
 - And just one more thing about being self-sufficient.

742
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,220
 I think, especially when unanswered prayers come up,

743
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,740
 I think it's so easy to stop praying.

744
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,060
 It's so easy to stop asking.

745
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,740
 It's so easy to be self-sufficient in that,

746
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,140
 okay, he's not answering my prayers.

747
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,220
 I will take over.

748
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,640
 I will provide for myself.

749
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,020
 I will strategize.

750
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,060
 I will plan.

751
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,900
 I will try to do it on my own strength.

752
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,900
 But then you end up taking your life into your own hands.

753
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,900
 And I think that's not what he wants.

754
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,480
 That's not what he wants for us to grow into.

755
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,740
 He wants us to grow into dependence on him every day.

756
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,260
 And so I think being persistent,

757
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,620
 I think part of it is also like

758
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,180
 when your prayers are not answered,

759
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,080
 when my prayers are not answered,

760
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,100
 we persist in listening to him.

761
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,740
 We persist in asking him, like Phil said,

762
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,660
 even there's pain and heartbreak and disappointment,

763
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,020
 but you don't turn away from God

764
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,420
 because when you turn away from God,

765
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,300
 there will be so many other things that will distract you

766
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,100
 and eventually take the place of God.

767
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,940
 But yeah, just being vulnerable and persistent in this age.

768
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,780
 - And the reason we can do that, right,

769
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,940
 going back to God's character is because

770
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,180
 as people of faith, as followers of Jesus, right,

771
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,100
 as Christians, we know God's character, right?

772
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,340
 That's the thing that sits at the center of our faith.

773
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,820
 We know God's character.

774
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,940
 We know that we can relate to him as a good father.

775
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,580
 Like I said, many, perhaps when we talk about

776
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,180
 our earthly fathers, there could be

777
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,100
 a bunch of different reactions, you know,

778
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,260
 maybe that triggers something really, really horrible

779
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,180
 in our experiences of fatherhood.

780
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,940
 But God is a good father, right?

781
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,340
 And we have to put our faith and trust in that,

782
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,780
 and which is why he goes on to say this, right?

783
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,080
 Which of you fathers, if your son asked for fish,

784
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,020
 would give him a snake instead?

785
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,100
 Or if he asked for an egg, would give him a scorpion?

786
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,380
 This is how you know, by the way, Jesus wasn't Chinese,

787
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,660
 'cause like snakes and scorpions are kind of edible

788
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,900
 as well, I guess, right?

789
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,060
 [audience laughing]

790
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,080
 Snake, sometimes people will eat snake

791
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,340
 instead of a fish, even, right?

792
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,180
 Anyway.

793
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,300
 Oh, okay, but you know, no father would do that, right?

794
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,420
 No, would give something bad in the place of something good.

795
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,780
 That's the point, okay?

796
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,940
 If then you, though you are evil,

797
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,340
 know how to give good gifts to your children,

798
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,880
 how much more will your father in heaven

799
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,040
 give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him, right?

800
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,680
 So it's like God going even, when you ask him for stuff,

801
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,640
 he knows you best, he is your father.

802
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,640
 He knows even better than what you think you need, right?

803
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,800
 It's like Isaiah bugging me for days,

804
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,640
 and is it Friday yet?

805
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,080
 'Cause on Friday we eat cereal, right?

806
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,000
 Can I have cereal today?

807
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,600
 Is this day the end of the week, you know?

808
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,960
 And like, every day he's asking me for that cereal,

809
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,080
 'cause that's all he wants to eat, right?

810
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,300
 But he gets it once a week,

811
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,820
 because if he ate it every week,

812
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,980
 every day, it wouldn't be good for his health,

813
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,060
 for his body, right?

814
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,180
 So sometimes when we ask for things,

815
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,320
 we have to always keep in mind the character of God, right?

816
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,900
 That he knows best, and what he gives us

817
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,820
 is provisions for what we need, right?

818
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,700
 Daily bread, things that he knows are good for us.

819
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,380
 Now from our limited wisdom and perspective,

820
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,860
 we might not always see in that way,

821
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,720
 but when we pray to the Father, he responds in love.

822
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,640
 Not like a, and the whole point of the parable

823
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,920
 is God is not a grumpy friend, right?

824
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,440
 God is not someone you have to beg and nag and persist,

825
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,400
 right, in order to get what you want.

826
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,120
 He is the complete opposite of that, right?

827
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,840
 His heart for you, right, like you were saying earlier,

828
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,520
 I'm like, promised her last week, right, is delighting.

829
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,360
 Right, my son's coming knocking at midnight.

830
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,640
 Yes, I'm gonna open the door.

831
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,760
 There's a feast for him, right?

832
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,440
 Everything's already been ready.

833
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,320
 I've been welcoming this.

834
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,640
 Much more so than a grumpy friend who only reacts

835
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,060
 'cause you've been too annoying,

836
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,500
 and finally he has to get up and answer you, right,

837
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,280
 just to keep you quiet.

838
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,800
 - Yeah, my son's name is Cyril,

839
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,820
 and when I'm thinking about how he asks me of things

840
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,980
 in his position as a son, he doesn't really overthink it.

841
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,140
 You know, we always do that kind of work in our head

842
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,260
 when we do our prayer, but Cyril doesn't.

843
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,120
 And, you know, that's probably the perfect way

844
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,480
 to do sonship and daughtership,

845
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,860
 to know that he wants us past midnight.

846
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,440
 He wants us when all the shops are closed,

847
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,580
 the doors are locked,

848
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,120
 everybody else in the world is sleeping.

849
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,060
 He just wants us always, and that's why we can come to him.

850
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,140
 - Yeah, so how does the Holy,

851
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,700
 but what does the Holy Spirit have to do with this, Sanjay?

852
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,900
 Because at the end it tells us, you know,

853
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,740
 he'll give you the Holy Spirit.

854
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,220
 So when it comes to the Holy Spirit,

855
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,140
 obviously there's something in the gift of the Holy Spirit

856
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,660
 that empowers us to be able to approach God

857
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,300
 and to pray to him, and that sort of influences

858
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,380
 the way we pray to God.

859
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,540
 - Yeah, I think just the key part that I notice

860
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,260
 is like when you see the passage,

861
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,820
 in the first, Jesus teaches about the prayer, right,

862
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,540
 the Lord's Prayer, and then he's like,

863
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,020
 "Give us this day our daily bread,"

864
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,740
 and then the next thing, the parable,

865
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,300
 is saying this friend asking for bread.

866
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,820
 And then in the end he says,

867
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,420
 "How much more will your Father in Heaven

868
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,580
 "give the Holy Spirit?"

869
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,900
 So in my head it's like, what are you asking for, bread?

870
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,540
 What are you asking for, bread?

871
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,340
 What is the Father gonna give, Holy Spirit?

872
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,980
 So then in my head it's like, the Holy Spirit

873
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,420
 is the bread that we need every day in our lives

874
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,540
 as Christians, as followers of Jesus,

875
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,580
 because he's the one that will help us,

876
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,940
 like your experience, right?

877
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,100
 He will be the one that will shape our prayers.

878
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,020
 He's the one that's answering our prayers,

879
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,580
 and he's the one that's teaching us how to pray

880
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,480
 at the same time.

881
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,740
 But yeah, we need, I think eventually we need him

882
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,900
 more than we realize we need bread.

883
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,420
 >> Yeah, 'cause without the Holy Spirit, right,

884
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,620
 I think what Emma was doing,

885
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,620
 without God we can do nothing, you know?

886
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,940
 And so the Holy Spirit is what binds us together,

887
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,940
 it's what God has given to all of us,

888
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,700
 how he provides for everybody, through the Holy Spirit.

889
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,180
 Now Emma, maybe going back to the communal part

890
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,940
 of this prayer then, you mentioned something earlier

891
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,900
 about self-preservation, about that being something

892
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,460
 that we don't often talk to each other

893
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,720
 about the things we need, right?

894
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,900
 There is maybe perhaps a little bit of shame

895
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,540
 in coming to a group of friends and saying,

896
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,340
 oh actually, I can't afford this,

897
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,940
 or actually, I'm sick, can you help me with something?

898
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,300
 As a person who's here in Hong Kong without family,

899
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,860
 when you came to this city, perhaps maybe share

900
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,100
 a little bit about your experience

901
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:14,100
 about how you being vulnerable and inviting the community,

902
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,260
 hopefully we've been a good friend to you

903
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,780
 and that you'd be terrible, you'd say,

904
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,140
 nobody ever helped me in nothing,

905
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,220
 I have to do everything by myself, right?

906
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,140
 But how has your community around you,

907
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,140
 when you presented those needs, right,

908
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,500
 and how did you see God work through,

909
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,660
 how the Holy Spirit worked through the community

910
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,340
 and people around you into answering some of your needs,

911
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,820
 some of your prayers at that time?

912
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,020
 - Yeah, that's, wow, I didn't see that question coming.

913
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,420
 This is an area where I've been whooped into shape,

914
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,420
 like vulnerability and dependence on God

915
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,180
 through dependence on his family, the church,

916
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,580
 because I, like if you didn't know, I live in Hong Kong,

917
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,940
 but my whole family isn't here, so it's just me, right?

918
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,580
 My biological family isn't here, and so, I mean, man,

919
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:09,580
 there have been so many, so many instances of being sick,

920
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:14,860
 being, like needing money, needing people to talk to,

921
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,620
 not knowing, I'm not only away from home,

922
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,140
 I'm also from a culture that's not the most open

923
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,740
 about talking about your problems,

924
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,780
 so it's like you kind of, like you struggle,

925
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,860
 you take it to Jesus.

926
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,540
 I'm also a preacher's kid, so I was taught, you know,

927
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,660
 you need help, you go find Jesus,

928
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,860
 Jesus doesn't answer, you wait until he does,

929
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,860
 that's it, so that's just kind of how I,

930
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,220
 it's been good in some ways for my prayer life

931
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,900
 and dependence on him and my realization

932
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,340
 that when he meets me, even if it's through people,

933
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,940
 that it is his provision, but I think one of the

934
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,940
 probably wildest moments for me was around,

935
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,420
 I think 2002, around 2002, this is,

936
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,260
 we were in the middle of COVID, so our doors were closed

937
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,300
 and we had, huh?

938
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,380
 - 2022? - Yeah.

939
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,780
 - 2022, not 2002. - Oh, what did I say?

940
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,620
 Oh, oops.

941
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,380
 - Yeah. - Oh, two, two.

942
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,220
 Sorry, 2022, so we are in the middle of the whole craze

943
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,860
 and the church doors are closed,

944
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,460
 we've just finished recording an Easter special,

945
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,580
 so that Easter Sunday, we didn't have to be

946
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,700
 in the auditorium, everybody watched it online,

947
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,180
 and I'm thinking, and Easter Monday, it's a holiday,

948
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,100
 so I'm thinking, oh, I'm just gonna get up late

949
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,340
 and we're gonna get brunch and then I'm gonna lounge around.

950
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,700
 I think the next day, I was hanging out with Balana,

951
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,300
 so it was like a whole weekend, I was excited,

952
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,660
 and that Easter Sunday, I started to feel unwell.

953
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,780
 And I was, I didn't know what it was,

954
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,380
 like I couldn't, it wasn't the kind of unwell

955
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,700
 where you can say I have a headache or I just felt off.

956
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,180
 And so, and it was so off that I texted a few friends,

957
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,220
 I think I texted Balana, Jeth, or Michelle,

958
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,140
 I'm like, hey guys, I'm gonna take a nap,

959
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:06,140
 but I feel so weird that in an hour, call me, just check,

960
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,980
 and they're like, whoa, what's going on?

961
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,340
 I'm like, I don't know, but I'm tired,

962
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,180
 so I'm gonna take a nap,

963
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,220
 and when I wake up, we'll deal with it.

964
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
 So I took a nap, anyway, the next day,

965
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,820
 I go to the ER to figure out what's going on,

966
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,180
 and I'm thinking this is gonna be quick,

967
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,900
 I'm gonna go in, they're gonna figure out,

968
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,140
 or they're gonna tell me it's fine, get some painkillers,

969
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,380
 and then I'm gonna go get my brunch,

970
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,460
 like this is properly the plan.

971
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,020
 I walk into the ER, and less than five minutes in,

972
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,900
 they rush me to see a doctor,

973
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,260
 and I didn't realize until later,

974
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,820
 that's really, really, you should be afraid.

975
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,940
 It doesn't, it was a public hospital on a public holiday,

976
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,240
 usually it's not that fast.

977
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,820
 So I get in, and like, they rush me through,

978
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,780
 and it's all these tests, all this crazy,

979
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,980
 essentially the doctor goes,

980
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,160
 looking at your symptoms, and looking at what you've shared,

981
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,780
 you've either just had a heart attack,

982
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,940
 or you've had a stroke.

983
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:59,940
 And, and you have to, we're gonna have to keep you.

984
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,780
 And we're in the middle of COVID,

985
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,300
 so imagine the craziness of like,

986
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,380
 you don't wanna be in a hospital,

987
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,740
 like away in a local hospital, so it's mostly Cantonese,

988
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,580
 they speak English,

989
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,700
 but they're more comfortable with Cantonese.

990
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,420
 And I didn't know I was gonna be,

991
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,420
 it was gonna be this dramatic,

992
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,620
 I was just being precautious.

993
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,960
 So now I have to text my community, right?

994
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,460
 'Cause I didn't tell them, I was like,

995
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,740
 I don't feel well, I'm a grownup,

996
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,660
 I can go to the hospital.

997
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,460
 And then I'll enforce a text.

998
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,980
 Hey guys, I'm in the hospital,

999
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,120
 and I'm gonna get hospitalized.

1000
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,140
 And they just, you know,

1001
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,420
 kind of give them the little rundown of it.

1002
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,180
 And I'm, you know, like half in tears as I'm typing it,

1003
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,340
 I don't know what to do, don't know, what do you,

1004
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,260
 what do you say?

1005
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,060
 But I think I found that through their,

1006
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,400
 'cause nobody could come to me,

1007
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,820
 it was definitely like, it's COVID,

1008
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,060
 so like nobody can get anywhere in a hospital.

1009
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,620
 But through their prayers,

1010
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,340
 and I had lawyer friends like break through the system

1011
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:01,420
 and deliver like cheese bread at random,

1012
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,460
 like it was,

1013
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,300
 I found Jesus to be so present

1014
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,340
 through the ridiculousness of my community.

1015
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,640
 From the banter, like there was incessant chat

1016
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,660
 throughout the entire time that I was there,

1017
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,140
 fully covered in prayer,

1018
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,500
 fully present in bringing me whatever nonsense I needed.

1019
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,620
 I think Michelle broke into my house,

1020
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,980
 brought me my Bible somehow.

1021
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,260
 And it just was like, I found,

1022
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,620
 I think, and through that experience, that's very dramatic,

1023
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,560
 but even through little experiences as well,

1024
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,560
 I realized I actually do have to say when I need something,

1025
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,500
 because they're not gonna know, right?

1026
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,300
 Like they can't read my mind.

1027
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,940
 And as a people of God,

1028
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,940
 we have to let go of whatever cultural things we're used to,

1029
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,480
 and align with kingdom culture that says,

1030
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,040
 you will be provided for if you ask.

1031
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,880
 You gotta think about it.

1032
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,000
 It's not like God doesn't know what you need, right?

1033
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,380
 Matthew six says, the Father knows what you need

1034
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,800
 before you ask, before you're even aware

1035
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,360
 of how to ask for it.

1036
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,280
 But he still requires us to ask.

1037
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,080
 And so for me, it's been a lesson in learning

1038
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,320
 how to tell people instead of growing bitter

1039
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,720
 because it's like nobody ever stands up for me.

1040
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,200
 Like how are they gonna know?

1041
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,040
 How are they gonna know?

1042
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,080
 They're not the Lord, and even the Lord says, ask me.

1043
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,360
 So in terms of community, it's really been for me

1044
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,920
 a journey in learning to ask and trust with no expectation,

1045
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,800
 trust that God will meet me,

1046
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,560
 and how he meets me is his business,

1047
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,200
 and who he meets me through is his business.

1048
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,920
 But my part is to ask, and to let the people

1049
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,800
 that he's placed around me know what I need.

1050
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,760
 - Yeah, that's beautiful, Amber, right?

1051
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,720
 That's such a, yeah.

1052
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,080
 (audience applauding)

1053
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,720
 So that's how prayer builds our relationship with God.

1054
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,560
 Like I was saying earlier, we pray, we tell God,

1055
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,960
 'cause that's how you build relationship,

1056
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,200
 by conversation, by talking.

1057
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,360
 And it was only ever one way, right?

1058
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,880
 And it would not be a relationship.

1059
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,320
 God wants us to tell him.

1060
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,360
 He wants us to ask him.

1061
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,280
 He wants us to tell him about the things

1062
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,120
 that we're going through

1063
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,120
 because that's how we build relationship.

1064
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,320
 It's the same with each other.

1065
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,720
 We go through things with each other.

1066
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,800
 Those days I spent with you,

1067
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,280
 well, those afternoons I spent with you in the hospital,

1068
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,840
 right, those were precious times to me, right,

1069
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,440
 to be alongside you in that process.

1070
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,960
 And so that's what God wants for his community.

1071
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,880
 And I think this afternoon, right here in this time,

1072
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,880
 perhaps as we close, it's a little bit of time

1073
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,320
 to do that as well.

1074
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,360
 We have an opportunity.

1075
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,840
 We have brothers and sisters around us, right?

1076
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,880
 If you're sitting here in this room today,

1077
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,040
 if you've called yourself a follower of Jesus,

1078
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,920
 then God is your father.

1079
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,180
 And so as God, as our father, sitting together right now,

1080
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,200
 it's an opportunity to come before him

1081
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,800
 with shameless audacity,

1082
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,260
 knowing we're not gonna be met with a grumpy God,

1083
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,800
 but with love.

1084
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,680
 In the same way, knowing that we've come to our friends

1085
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,760
 with our burdens and things we need,

1086
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,240
 hopefully we're not, oh, yeah, Jethro, so annoying, fine,

1087
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,360
 here's a million dollars, you know,

1088
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,200
 just go and live your life, whatever, okay?

1089
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,280
 But to have a friend that's concerned,

1090
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,280
 you know, that's willing, okay,

1091
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,400
 hey, I know you're struggling.

1092
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,000
 Well, now let's do this together, figure it out, right?

1093
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,260
 We're in this as a family.

1094
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,920
 But if we don't share, like Emma was saying, we don't know.

1095
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,080
 So what I want us to do is to perhaps take,

1096
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,920
 we have a little time left before the service closes,

1097
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,280
 with the people around you,

1098
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,640
 if you are so brave enough to share

1099
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,580
 maybe some of the burdens that you have.

1100
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,080
 Maybe you came in here today with something that,

1101
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,920
 oh, this is something that I've been needing, right?

1102
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,520
 This is a provision I've been praying for.

1103
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,480
 Perhaps the answer is in this room here today, right?

1104
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,400
 And as you share, it will be met in some way, right?

1105
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,520
 So if you're brave enough,

1106
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,400
 if you came with people you trust with,

1107
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,660
 or if the Holy Spirit is prompting you

1108
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,840
 to share with somebody,

1109
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,960
 take the opportunity to do that right now.

1110
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,440
 Or maybe if you just want to talk to God,

1111
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,320
 you know, and let Him know,

1112
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,620
 maybe it's been a while since you've done that.

1113
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,560
 Maybe you could, maybe this is a time to do that as well.

1114
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,560
 But take a couple of minutes to share,

1115
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,520
 and then take a couple of minutes to actually pray

1116
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,960
 with each other and for one another,

1117
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,080
 or maybe, like I said, even for yourself.

1118
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,440
 And then we're gonna take a few minutes to do that,

1119
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,120
 and then Jethro's gonna close us with a prayer

1120
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,940
 before we end the service in a little bit.

1121
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,540
 Does that sound all right, church?

1122
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,000
 Okay, so yeah, find a spot.

1123
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,440
 I'm gonna invite the band to come up.

1124
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,260
 They're just gonna play softly some music

1125
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,420
 in the background while we do this.

1126
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,320
 But really take some time to bring this parable

1127
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,540
 and these things, these teachings we've been talking about

1128
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,420
 to life this afternoon, church.

1129
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,000
 (gentle music)

1130
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,580
 (gentle music)

1131
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:08,580
