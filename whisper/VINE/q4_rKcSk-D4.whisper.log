[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   So there was this moment that happened for me on my recent walk of the Camino de Santiago
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:16.000]   in Spain that deeply reminds me of what we have just been singing about in that song.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.560]   The Camino is around about 800 kilometers of length.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.360]   You walk from this place called Saint Jean in France all the way to Santiago de Compostela
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.040]   in the west coast of Spain.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.600]   And as you walk every day, you connect to and walk through and pass multiple Catholic
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.600]   churches.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.760]   In fact, on any particular given day, you might walk through, say, three to five different
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.960]   villages and every single one of those villages will be centered around some form of church,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.360]   this Catholic church.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.160]   And some of those churches are incredibly beautiful, huge, wonderful buildings, like
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.260]   architectural wonders.
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.760]   Some of those churches are small, rural, almost forgotten churches where maybe inside there's
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.480]   nothing more than a couple of pews and a rusty old iron cross.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.000]   And I used to love when I was walking the Camino to take every opportunity I could to
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.480]   connect with a church.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.680]   If I was walking past a church, inevitably those churches would be open.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.520]   And most of the time, they were open and no one was in there.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.200]   And so I loved that because it meant that I could go in, have a time of solitude, maybe
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.260]   take my backpack off for 10 minutes and just sit there and pray and encounter the presence
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.260]   of God.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.720]   These churches were like wonderful gifts of solitude as we walked every day.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.840]   Well, on this particular day, I was walking into this small village and I noticed that
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.400]   there was a church that was off the trail.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.240]   Now this was somewhat unusual because usually the Camino, the official trail, takes you
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.600]   to the center of a village or the center of a town and right up to the big church in the
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.760]   center of the town.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.160]   But for whatever reason in this particular village, the Camino path was going straight
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.160]   ahead and avoiding the little church that was over to the left.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.880]   And I saw it would take me maybe about five or seven minutes to walk over to that church
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.600]   and I had time and so I decided, "Okay, look, I'm going to go off the path.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.160]   I'm going to go over there and I'm going to just have my time of solitude in this church."
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.640]   So I enter into this church.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.640]   It's a small church.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.360]   It's probably got about maybe, it could seat maybe 50 people in total.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.840]   So a small kind of church.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.880]   As I walk straight in, I'm the only person there or at least I thought I was, but as
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.920]   soon as I walk in, I hear this kind of like person get up from sitting down over on the
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.800]   right side and it's this old nun and she runs up to me with this big smile on her face and
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   she's so excited that a pilgrim has entered the church.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.200]   I could tell from her face that she's been waiting a long time for someone to come and
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.120]   visit her in her church.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.820]   And she's got this big smile on her face and she literally runs up to me and she grabs
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.560]   my arms with her little hands and she starts speaking to me excitedly in Spanish.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.280]   Now if you know me, you'll know I know nothing of Spanish at all, but in that moment I could
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.140]   see her enthusiasm and her joy that I had visited.
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.280]   So I didn't want to break her heart by telling her I didn't speak Spanish.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.800]   So I just let her talk and as she talked, I followed her nonverbal cues as to pretend
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.120]   that I understood her.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.400]   So if she smiled, I would be like, "Oh!"
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.200]   If she nodded, I would be like, "Hmm."
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.480]   And I basically was trying to pretend like, I think probably after a while she realized
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.280]   I couldn't speak Spanish, but anyway, she kept going and she was so enthusiastic, so
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   excited.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.240]   She grabbed me on the arm and she started to walk me through her church.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.400]   Now again, it's not a particularly big church, but there were like paintings and icons all
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.280]   over this church as there often are in Catholic churches.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.720]   And so she wanted to like show me and tell me in incredibly detailed Spanish all about
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.060]   these paintings and the icons.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.320]   And so I'm polite and I'm nice and so I'm following her along and nodding at the right
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.280]   times and laughing at the right time.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.880]   We get about halfway around and by this time we're standing at the front where the kind
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.040]   of nave of the church is and we're standing there and she's talking away and we hear somebody
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.320]   else enter the church.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.800]   And so we both kind of turn and sure enough in the entrance of the church, another pilgrim
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   walks in.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   Now, this pilgrim, you can tell he's a pilgrim because he's wearing his backpack and everything,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.200]   looks like a pilgrim.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.360]   He's probably in his late 50s, early 60s.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.960]   And he comes in and he stands literally inside the entrance of the church and he starts to
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.220]   weep.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.520]   Now this is not just like your standard kind of like a couple of tears, a little bit embarrassed,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.400]   sort of, "Oh, I don't really mean to be crying here at the moment," kind of tears.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.080]   This was like a wailing kind of mourning, kind of gnashing of teeth, kind of very loud
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.960]   sort of sobbing that this man was doing.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.840]   The nun stares up at me and her eyes are filled with this beautiful picture of compassion
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.200]   and she leaves me straight away and I don't know if you have ever seen a nun run.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   But if you ever get the chance to see a nun run, I highly recommend it.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.580]   She leaves me and she hitches up like the skirt of her habit and she runs down the center
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.080]   of the church to this man.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.220]   She runs up to him and embraces him in this big hug.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.240]   And then she gingerly and tenderly walks him and sits him down in one of the pews and she
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.880]   begins to pray for him.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.280]   And there is this profound moment that something is happening in this little church that no
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.520]   one perhaps expected.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.500]   And that moment of great compassion of hers and the running towards the one in need filled
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.960]   and stirred compassion in me.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.920]   And I remember feeling to myself like I just came in here to connect with Jesus, but actually
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.840]   now is a chance for me to be pastoral.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.680]   And so I walked, I didn't run, I walked down the church and I came up against the man and
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.160]   I just gently placed my hand on his shoulder and I began to pray.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.720]   And the nun is praying fervently for him and he's loudly wailing and crying.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.600]   And I didn't know anything about this man at that moment, but a few days later I discovered
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.980]   that he was a Portuguese man and he had been a homicide detective for 20 years.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.240]   And he was walking the Camino just as he is retired, he's walking the Camino to purge
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.720]   the evil that he had seen out of himself over 20 years.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.640]   And something happened in that moment where he walks into that church, the Holy Spirit
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.320]   meets with him and we have this profound encounter together.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.600]   And as we're standing there praying over him, we're praying in human languages that are
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.160]   mixed and only partially understood, but we're also praying in a heart and emotional language
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.960]   that is clear and fully understood, perhaps more understood than any other language can
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.960]   be.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.920]   And that's the universal language of unadulterated love.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   Love.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.600]   I wonder if you've ever tried to describe love or try to find words to explain to somebody
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   what love is.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.040]   It's actually really hard, isn't it, to kind of use language to try to describe a factual
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.680]   or logical understanding of what love is.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:36.160]   But when we're swept up in a moment of love, when love breaks through barriers and begins
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   to do what only love can do, well, it lifts something in us as human beings, doesn't it?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.160]   It creates something within us and it binds us together as humans like nothing ever can.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.840]   There are three strangers who don't even speak the same language can find a deeper connection
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.600]   than in any other time.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:05.240]   When love breaks through, humans become just the way they were created to be.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.040]   It's interesting.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:14.200]   I wonder if you've ever thought of love that way, that love actually makes us truly human,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:21.040]   that the moments of pure love are our most natural and rawest moments as human beings.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.720]   There's a lot of talk right now about AI and about the future of AI and particularly about
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.960]   the future of humanity swept up in this kind of formation and forming and shaping of what
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.440]   humanity will look like in the future because of AI.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.440]   And I think there's a lot of things to be excited for with this development of AI, as
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.680]   well as perhaps some things for us to be cautious about.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.520]   But here's one thing I do know.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.240]   There is one thing that no matter how advanced AI may become, it will never be able to do.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.280]   And that is the love.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:01.920]   You see, I'm convinced that love is our unique contribution to the world that sets us apart
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.280]   as human beings who are made in the image of God.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.120]   Isn't that a beautiful thought?
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.980]   That love might be the one thing that sets us apart.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.520]   That love might be the unique thing that has been placed inside of us to help us to contribute
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.040]   something to this incredible creation that God has made.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:28.320]   Could it be that love is able to do what no algorithm could ever predict or do?
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.880]   I've been in those moments, maybe you have too, where love immediately shifts a very
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.640]   difficult conversation.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.920]   Where love brings new hope into what was thought to be a lost cause.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.400]   Where love actually changes the dynamics of a relationship in a moment.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.360]   Or perhaps where love actually bridges the divide of hatred or ignorance.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:58.440]   When we are swept up in those moments of love, we know that the world can actually change.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.300]   We know that those moments of love shift and change things in a way that, like I say, no
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.080]   computer can ever predict or ever do.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.200]   And the reality is also in the reverse.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.280]   You see, strip love from us and we become less than human.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:21.320]   I would say we become programmable animals that are broken and controlled, but place
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.320]   love within us.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.440]   And we become the very creatures that we had been created to be.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:36.880]   Human beings filled with vision and imagination and passion and creativity and hope.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:43.760]   And if this is who we've truly been created to be, and if love is the rawest and most
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:50.440]   natural form of our expression of what it means to be human, could it be, therefore,
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:57.120]   that as the world embraces more of an AI future, this is an opportunity for the world to actually
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.080]   become more in love with God?
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.720]   Because if it is love that is going to set us aside from the computers around us, then
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.240]   maybe we should be connecting into the source of that love more than ever.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.200]   The Bible is very clear where that source comes from.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.240]   It says God is love.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.440]   It doesn't say God does love.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.240]   It doesn't say God has this kind of, you know, sort of program to love things.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.560]   It says the actual very nature and essence of who God is, is love.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.920]   And because he is love, he has first loved us.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.320]   And because he's first loved us, our love then is a response to the love that's been
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.720]   placed within us from him.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.520]   And if it is love that makes us the most naturally human that we can possibly be, and if in an
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.060]   AI future we want to retain our humanity, then it follows, does it not, that we need
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.800]   to be connecting into the source of where that love comes from.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.160]   I'm excited that the future that may well get more AI is an opportunity for the church
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:05.920]   to rise up and say, "Hey, there's one who is able to give us what no computer ever can."
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.640]   Love like that remains.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.480]   Which is fascinating because although Paul, the apostle Paul, writing to the church in
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:20.000]   Corinth had no idea about AI whatsoever, he saw a church that was struggling to truly
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   love.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.160]   In fact, he saw a church that was actually fighting each other, a church that was actually
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.880]   treating each other incredibly poorly, and so he decides to write to them in the heart
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.120]   of his letter, chapters 12, 13, and 14 of 1 Corinthians, and talk to them about the
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.240]   attitudes and the behaviors and the ways in which they were expressing their humanity
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.800]   towards one another.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.560]   And in chapter 12 and 14, he talks about some of the ways within their church community
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.440]   they were expressing their humanity through both their natural gifts and spiritual gifts.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.600]   And right in between those two chapters in chapter 13, he actually begins to say to them,
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.960]   "But you need to understand that if you try to express your humanity without love, then
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.480]   you're not contributing anything to this world.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.680]   No matter how great your gifts are, no matter how amazing the things that you might be doing
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.920]   are, if it's without love, it is nothing."
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.120]   And as he begins to explain this idea of love, he begins to challenge his church in this
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.520]   now but not yet time, this time of Advent in which they're living in.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.720]   And we've been basing our Advent series here at the Vine over this past month in exactly
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   this passage.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.120]   I want to read it to you from 1 Corinthians 13, verses 8 onwards.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.880]   We started the series with this.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.920]   I want to finish the series with this.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.880]   Starting in verse 8, he says this, "Love never fails.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.800]   But where there are prophecies, they will cease.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.160]   Where there are tongues, they will be stilled.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.600]   Where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.280]   We know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes," talking about the
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   end of all things, "the imperfect," this now but not yet time, "disappears.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.080]   When I was a child, I taught like a child.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.320]   I thought like a child.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.920]   I responded like a child.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.640]   But when I became a man, I put those childish ways behind me."
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.760]   You see, he's talking about this now but not yet.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.360]   "Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.640]   Then we're going to see face to face when Christ returns.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.240]   Now I know in part," he says, "but then I shall know fully even as right now I'm fully
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.240]   known."
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:28.160]   And now these three things remain right here in this now but not yet time, faith, hope,
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   and love.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.440]   But the greatest of these is love.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.760]   I love how Paul is doing this and we've been unpacking this, haven't we, over the last
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.880]   couple of weeks here.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.880]   He's talking about this now but not yet time.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.600]   Christ has come in his first advent that we celebrate at Christmas.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.680]   Christ is returning at the end of all things as a conquering king.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.840]   And he's saying, "We live in this time where we don't have all the knowledge.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.240]   We don't have everything worked out perfectly.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.880]   We're living in a time where, yes, Christ has come, died for our sins and raised, but
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.040]   we're living in a time where sin still has an influence on us.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.720]   And the culmination, the fulfillment of the redemptive story of Christ will only take
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.320]   place when he returns at the end of all things.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.460]   And we live in this longing time, this maranatha, come Lord Jesus time.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.840]   But he says, "God has not left us alone in the in-between.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.960]   God has given us three things which helps us to navigate when we don't have all the
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.440]   answers, when we don't have it all worked out, when we are longing but we don't see
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.080]   the promises coming through.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.720]   Three things, faith, hope, and love."
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.500]   And then he says, "The greatest of these is love."
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.560]   Which should raise an important question for you when you read this because it should ask
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.720]   or cause you to ask the question, "Why is love the greatest?"
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.360]   Because we've seen how important over the last couple of weeks faith is, how faith is
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.920]   essential to this time.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.840]   And without faith we'd be lost.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:57.360]   We've seen how hope motivates us and draws us out and makes us the people that we want
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.360]   to be.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.960]   So we know how important faith and hope is.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.960]   Why is love then the greatest?
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.080]   Well Paul gives a couple of answers.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.200]   His partial answer comes at the start of verse eight.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.480]   Let me read it to you again.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.080]   He says, "Love never fails."
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.200]   Another way of saying this, actually translating the Greek a little bit better, is "Love never
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.400]   ends" or "Love never ceases."
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.120]   Which connects with what Paul is saying here because he says, "Look, love never ceases,
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.400]   but prophecy, that'll cease."
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.920]   All this knowledge that we have, yeah, that's going to cease.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.640]   Even I would argue, Paul would say this, "Faith and hope, that will also cease, but the one
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:42.320]   thing that never ends, never ceases, and therefore never fails, is love."
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.880]   Think about this for a second, right?
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.960]   Faith is given to us.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.160]   We've defined faith a couple of weeks ago from Hebrews chapter 11, where it says, "Faith
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:56.000]   is the confidence of what I hope for and the assurance of what is not yet seen."
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.040]   So faith is this idea that we have faith in order to get us to the point where Christ
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040]   returns.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.600]   We are longing for Him to come, and it is the idea that I am assured today of what I
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.080]   do not yet see.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.800]   But when Christ comes again, as Paul says in these verses, he says, "Then we will see
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.240]   face to face."
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.000]   So we will see face to face.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.800]   We no longer have to have faith in Him because the fullness of Him will be present with us.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.680]   So faith will cease.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.680]   Same with hope.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:31.520]   See, hope we've defined last week as this confident expectation, this assurance of what's
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.600]   going to happen in the future because of our deep understanding of the goodness and the
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.300]   grace of God today.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:43.240]   So we are longing for these promises of God to come in this here and now.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.480]   But when He does return at the end of all things, all promises will be fulfilled.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.480]   All promises will be there.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   There'll be no more death.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.880]   There'll be no more pain.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.560]   There'll be no more sin or even the possibility of sin.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.160]   There's only one tree at that end of all things, other than the two trees that were there in
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.160]   Genesis.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.560]   Everything, all the promises of God and the beauty of Shalom will all be ours.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.440]   We won't need to hope anymore because the fullness of hope will be with us.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.920]   Are you following this?
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.600]   But love, he says, is the greatest because love never ends.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.760]   In other words, when Christ comes, our relationship will be fullness of love with Him and with
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.420]   others in that place for all eternity.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.000]   That's the beauty of the Christian story.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.360]   And because that's what we're getting, Paul is saying this is the reason why love is the
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.760]   greatest because faith and hope, as important as they are right now, they get us, if you
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.780]   will, to the place where He returns.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.080]   But when He comes, they're no longer needed.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.280]   But love will endure.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.480]   Love will continue.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.840]   Love will be what we will experience for eternity.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.280]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   But I want you to hear something else.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.520]   He's saying love is the greatest, not just because it'll be the thing that we will have
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.720]   for all eternity.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.440]   It's because we can experience the fullness of it now.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.440]   We don't need to wait until we get there to experience it.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.920]   It actually can be a part of our human story today.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.480]   Now to understand what Paul is saying about that, we have to actually understand what
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:25.240]   he means by love when he uses the word love throughout the chapter 13 here in 1 Corinthians.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.760]   You may know that in the Greek language in the first century, there were six words in
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.360]   the Greek language that we would translate into English as love.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.520]   The two most popular in the first century was eros, which is kind of sexual or romantic
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.760]   love, and philia, which was like loyal friendship and kind of love that is happening between
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.880]   two committed friends.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.640]   But there was this other word for love, one of the other six words, it's the word agape.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.520]   You probably have heard this if you've been a Christian for some time.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:03.280]   Agape is this idea of a love that was defined in the Greek culture as radical, sacrificial,
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.480]   selfless love.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.240]   And when the church was thinking, what is the word for love from the Greek language
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.720]   that we're going to apply to our relationship with God and to who God is, it's this word
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.880]   agape that they chose.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.200]   Now what's fascinating for us is that we often, when we think of agape love, I think in the
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.560]   church today, we most genuinely focus on God and God's love for us.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.560]   We think God's love is agape, which is absolutely true.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.560]   But Paul is wanting us to understand that it's not just an agape love that comes from
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:42.120]   him to us, but agape should also be the love that we give to one another.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.720]   And that, my friends, changes everything.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.080]   And I want to kind of unpack this by taking you quickly just to another passage outside
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080]   of Paul.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.440]   I want to take you to 1 John, starting in verse 4.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.240]   I want you to listen to how the disciple John writes this.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.640]   In verse 10 he says this.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.320]   He says, "This is agape love.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.280]   Not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.280]   our sins.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:15.560]   So, dear friends, since God so loved us, agape-ed us, we ought to now agape one another.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:23.200]   No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   complete in us."
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.440]   I think this is really powerful because what he's kind of saying here is, here's what the
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.760]   ultimate picture of agape is.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.400]   You want to know what agape is?
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   This is what it is.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.000]   It is this unadulterated, selfless, other-centered love.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:48.480]   See, agape is when we give of ourself completely to sacrificing for somebody else's benefit.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.040]   And John goes, "Okay, what's the best picture I can give you to understand what agape is?"
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   "Oh, I know what it is.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   It's the cross of Jesus."
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.060]   How could it be anything else?
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.160]   You want to see the ultimate picture of what agape looks like?
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:06.880]   It's a God who so loved the world that he was willing to send his only Son into the
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:13.120]   darkness, into the brokenness, into the sin, into all the pain, come and be born as a helpless,
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:20.360]   defenseless child, grow up around a world tainted so deeply and marred so ugly with
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:26.880]   sin, go and be eventually killed on a Roman cross, essentially a torture device, in order
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.440]   that everyone else who would ever align in relationship and belief and faith in him would
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.680]   not ever perish to death, but know eternal life.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.000]   The writer John is saying that's agape.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.280]   It is completely sacrificial, completely selfless.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.880]   It is other-centered love.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:54.520]   It's the kind of love that would take an old Spanish nun who has never had a person visit
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.680]   her for weeks, who then shows that person around the church and is having a great time
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.400]   with that person, but when somebody turns up who is more in need, she is willing to
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.200]   let go of that one and run as fast as she can towards the person in need.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.160]   That's agape.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:18.480]   That's sacrificing everything else in order the other would flourish as God would desire
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.480]   them to.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.960]   If I was to give you a definition of agape, here's how I would straightaway define it.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:29.600]   Agape love is the overflow of our delight in God that joyfully cherishes and seeks the
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.240]   best interest of another even when it comes at great sacrifice to ourselves.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.280]   I want you to hear what John says here.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.600]   He says, "Here's the greatest example of agape love.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:46.960]   It's the cross, but because we have the cross, because God has loved us like that, we now,"
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.920]   he says, "should love one another."
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.600]   He doesn't say we now should eros one another or philea one another.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.520]   He says we should agape one another.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.600]   In other words, the sacrifice seen on the cross should be the starting point for how
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.360]   we now love each other.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:07.320]   And that if we could love each other in that way, we might actually begin to model and
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.720]   shape the future of this world to be a place that when Christ returns, we would come to
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:18.000]   see the fullness of that love fulfilled.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.120]   This my friends is what Christmas is all about.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.840]   The love of Christmas is agape love in its fullness.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.560]   It is the decision that God made to give his son.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.840]   And of course, the cross is going to happen later.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:39.080]   But in that moment in Bethlehem, in that moment of calling Mary, this sacrificial love comes
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.400]   to us so that we would eventually know how it is that we should treat one another.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.000]   Think of it this way.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:54.360]   Jesus is God's expression of other-centered love, which comes at a high cost, the highest
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:02.520]   cost of one who gives up his life, gives something so that everyone else might receive.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.800]   That's Christmas.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.640]   That's what we're going to be celebrating on Wednesday.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.960]   That should be driving everything we think about as we go through this season that we're
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.800]   celebrating right now.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.120]   That Jesus is this representative of agape love, something given so that everybody else
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.120]   can receive.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.920]   And if you look through the Christmas story, it's a story of agape love.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:28.120]   I mean, think about Mary and Joseph who had to sacrifice their reputation and what everybody
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.480]   else thought of them and all the judgment everybody was making because they were unmarried
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.280]   and she was pregnant, but they were willing to sacrifice it in obedience to what God had
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.960]   called them to do, agape.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.880]   Think about the shepherds, the shepherds who are called by the angels in the sky to leave
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:51.280]   behind over a year's worth of finances, their livelihood in the sheep, and leave them to
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.400]   wander off into the wilderness so that they could go to Bethlehem and meet the Savior.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.800]   Agape love.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.000]   The Magi who travel from afar, that's not where their love was found.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Their love was found in the fact that they were willing to risk their own lives by disobeying
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.640]   what Herod had said and said, "Come back and let me know where Jesus is."
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.360]   When the Magi decided they were not going to return to let Herod know, they were putting
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.520]   their lives at central risk.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.840]   Agape love.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.960]   So when we think about Christmas, what we should be asking ourselves is, are we living
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.480]   this agape love?
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.280]   It's a challenging question and it's the question you have to have in mind when you read 1 Corinthians
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.280]   13.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.760]   I want to take you actually to the beginning of the chapter.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.360]   Now that you've got that context in mind, now that we understand a little bit more of
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   what this love is that we're being called to, now we go back and we actually read what
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.160]   Paul is trying to teach to his church at the beginning of 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.360]   And let me say this, it is not about marriage or weddings.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.960]   You've heard this a lot of times and as I start to read this, you're immediately going
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.800]   to think of a wedding.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.240]   Please do not.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.360]   I want you to stay seated in the bigger picture of what I'm talking about.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.680]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.160]   Okay, let me read this to you.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.240]   This is 1 Corinthians 13 starting in verse 1.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:15.040]   If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.080]   gong or a clanging cymbal.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.880]   If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, if I have
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.380]   faith that can move mountains but not love, I am nothing.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:31.480]   If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love,
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.080]   I gain nothing.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.600]   It's fascinating what Paul does here.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.040]   He basically is talking to the current church about their natural and spiritual gifts.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.920]   But I think we can broaden it to us to think about humanity and how we express our humanity.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.520]   And he mentions three things in these three verses.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.200]   In the first verse, he basically says, what if somebody was a really good speaker, a really
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:59.960]   good presenter, told a really great story, but if they did it without love, it's nothing.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.680]   In the second one, he talks about wisdom and knowledge and prophecy and understanding.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.300]   It's like he's saying, hey, if you had someone who did a great TED Talk and opened up a new
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.040]   way of thinking, gave you data to understand something, and you were like blown away by
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:17.000]   their intellect and their wonder and what they thought, but if they did that without
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.860]   love, it's nothing.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.520]   Then in the third bucket, he says, what about you have someone who looks like they're loving,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.520]   but they're not?
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.520]   In other words, they're giving away.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.520]   They're giving away all their money.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.480]   They're giving away all their time.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:34.280]   They're loving in what looks like a sacrificial way, but they do it without sacrificial love.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.320]   It is nothing.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.000]   Which is Paul saying something very challenging to the church.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.500]   He's saying, if you really want to be human, if you want to be the way that God has created
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.880]   you to be, you can do all of these things that on the surface appear great human things.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.080]   Oh, the artist who tells an amazing story.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.840]   Oh, the incredibly smart person who knows it all.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.600]   Oh, the person who's so generous with everything.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.820]   You can do all of those things, but if you do them without love, here's what happens.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.820]   This is very important.
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.200]   He says, you are nothing.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.480]   Notice, he does not say your gift is nothing.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.600]   He doesn't say, hey, if you do all these great things without love, then the gift is worthless
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   and nothing will happen.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.400]   No, he says, you're worthless.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.120]   You have gained nothing.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.840]   You are nothing.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.140]   I can get up here, and this challenges me deeply.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:31.140]   I can get up here and do an amazing sermon and wow you with my oratory and tell you incredible
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.400]   stories about nuns in Spain.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:39.680]   I can do all of this, and you can leave here going, that was a great message.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:46.080]   Wow, God spoke to me and I learned something, which can happen, and I can do that without
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:52.680]   love and you can still go away being blessed, but I am nothing.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.160]   This is the danger of what Paul's saying.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.800]   He's saying we can have a world where it appears like there's all this great human wisdom,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   all this great human stuff, but when it's done without agape, when it's done without
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:10.400]   sacrificial, other-centered thinking, what it essentially will do is basically try to
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.720]   build yourself up rather than build anyone else up.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.960]   See, I can preach the greatest sermon to you, but if I don't have love, I'm essentially
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.480]   trying to make myself great and not Christ great.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.000]   If I do it without love, I'm not actually thinking about you.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   I'm thinking about me.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.240]   I'm thinking about making sure this is the perfect sermon that you're going to love and
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.960]   you're going to go and tell all your friends and more people will come to the vine, because
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.480]   that's about me.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.720]   It's about my church.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.760]   It's about this stuff here.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.480]   And Paul's saying, when you do that, you are nothing.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.840]   And Paul's saying, I don't want you to be nothing.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.680]   I want you to be something.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.080]   I want you to be the very person that Christ has called you to be, who he's made you to
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.080]   be.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.480]   And he's saying, do those things, yes, but do them from sacrificial, other-centered love.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.240]   And when you love like that, oh, the world changes, he's saying.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.480]   When you love like that, things shift and change.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:14.080]   But when you fail as a human being to love agape ways, you will always end up imaging
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.240]   yourself to the world.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.220]   You will always end up filling the earth with your glory.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:25.360]   And you will basically fail to become the person that you were called to be.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.840]   It's really important that you hear that.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.480]   When we fail to live as human beings from a place of agape love, we image ourself to
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   the world.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.660]   We fill the earth with our glory and we fail to become the people that we were actually
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.660]   intended to be.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.560]   And when that happens, that breaks the heart of God.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:52.540]   Agape is this incredible thought that actually I was designed to give everything to you so
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:58.020]   that you would be the best that you can be, trusting that you're going to give everything
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:02.120]   to me so that I might become the best that I can be.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.180]   And we do that because God has first loved us.
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.420]   We're not trying to love sacrificially in our own strength.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:12.900]   We're not trying to love one another in our niceness and try to be a little bit better
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.900]   than others.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.620]   No, I've received a sacrificial love that is founded in the cross of Christ.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.940]   And out of the overflow of gratitude, out of the overflow of feeling that love and forgiveness
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:28.660]   of my sins for myself, I can now stand before others and want the very best for you without
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:32.000]   thinking what's the very best for me.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.060]   This is radical because what Paul's essentially doing here is he's turning upside down common
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.540]   thinking about self-help and self-love.
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.820]   See this world is like, "Hey, you need some more self-love.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.500]   Get on that retreat.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.060]   Get away.
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.180]   Prioritize yourself.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.520]   Put up more boundaries.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.640]   Make sure you're better.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.380]   Make sure that you've got your time.
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.360]   Make sure you're prioritizing you.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.700]   Love your truth.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.580]   Love yourself."
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.700]   And Paul's flipping it all upside down and he's saying, "You want to know where self-love
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.100]   is?
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.560]   It's found in other-centered love.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.640]   You want to know how to flourish yourself best?
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.400]   Give yourself away.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.720]   You want to know how to feel the best that you could ever feel?
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.260]   Love others like they're the center of your world.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:24.320]   When you do that, something transcendent happens and you become fully alive.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:29.680]   When a nun hitches up her habit and runs to a broken man, when I go over not understanding
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.120]   a word but lay a hand on his shoulder, not knowing anything about his story, I can feel
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.200]   the most alive that I have felt ever.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:44.560]   When we truly agape in this world, we actually love ourselves."
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:51.920]   Which is a very beautiful, complicated, incredibly deep theological but also very practical thing.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.240]   And it's this practical thing that Paul now turns to.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:59.840]   Let me show you these words that he then speaks of and these are so famous to us but again,
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.720]   try to follow along with this new thinking we have about sacrificial love for the other's
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.720]   benefit.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.200]   Love is patient.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.540]   Love is kind.
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.540]   It does not envy.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.540]   It does not boast.
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.540]   It is not proud.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.540]   It is not rude.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.000]   It is not self-seeking.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.640]   It is not easily angered.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.680]   It keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.040]   Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:26.120]   It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.000]   It's really important you understand that what Paul's not doing here is trying to define
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   love.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.680]   Remember I said earlier at the start, it's hard for us to find the words that define love.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.280]   He's not trying to define love here.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.080]   What he's trying to say is you want to know what a world looks like when people agape
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.360]   one another.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.280]   You want to know what it feels like for you when somebody agapes to you.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.600]   You want to know what it feels like when you're able to give of someone else.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.000]   It feels like this.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.960]   But also you want to know what happens when we don't do those things from a place of love,
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.760]   when we don't find love as the driving factor to the way in which we serve and love one
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.760]   another.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.120]   So it then feels and seems and acts like this.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.800]   So he's not trying to define some like, you know, dictionary version of love.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.840]   He's trying to paint a picture of how the world might be and give us the reason why
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.840]   the world isn't always like that.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.440]   So he gives seven descriptors of positive outcomes and eight of negative.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.720]   Look at this.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.760]   What love is, patient, kind, truthful, protects, trusts, hopes, perseveres.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:32.740]   But it isn't envious, boastful, proud, rude, self-seeking, angry, shameful, evil.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.340]   What he's essentially saying is this.
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:40.280]   If you do all the great things you can do as a human being, whether that's great speaking
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:45.600]   or great knowledge or great generosity, but you do it without love, here's what you're
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.760]   putting out in the world.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.960]   You're putting out envious, boastful, proud, rude, self-seeking, angry, shameful, and essentially
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.080]   evil.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.000]   That's what you're shaping in the world.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.320]   But when you love with agape in the way that Christ has loved you and demonstrates that
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.400]   love on the cross, well, here's what you put out in the world.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.840]   You're patient.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.200]   You have long suffering with those that don't always get it or kind of annoy you or kind
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.960]   of have hurt you.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.440]   You have this kind, truthfulness to you.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.740]   You protect, you trust, you hope, persevere.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.220]   You want to do all these things for others in the world.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.800]   And Paul's not saying, "Hey, don't do these things.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   Try and do these things."
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.080]   He's not saying, "Okay, the application of this sermon is just to try to be nicer this
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.080]   week."
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.200]   If you could try to be nicer, that would go along.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.520]   That's not what Paul's trying to say to his church.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.100]   It's not what I'm trying to say to you this morning.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:40.920]   This is not about finding within yourself more niceness.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:45.200]   This is about realizing that the love that we receive through the Holy Spirit, remember
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.040]   the fruit of the Holy Spirit, first of all, is love.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:52.420]   The love that we receive through the Holy Spirit, which is other-centered and sacrificial
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:58.600]   to us, overflows within us and causes us to want to do anything other than these things.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:03.440]   It causes us to want to serve and to love and be kind and be grateful.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.320]   It's not about trying to be nicer so I'm on the right side of the equation.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:12.260]   It's about asking the Holy Spirit to create a fruit of agape in me so that when a broken
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:17.720]   man walks into a church, I'm the first one to run rather than the none.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   Come on, church.
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.340]   I got such a thing.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:26.380]   She had such a thing in her that when he stepped in, she went straight away and left me behind.
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.380]   It hurt.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.380]   No, it didn't hurt.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.380]   It didn't hurt.
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.860]   But I could tell the tour was over.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.100]   But why wasn't I the first one to run?
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.980]   Where is this agape-ness with me?
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.380]   When I look at these lists, if I'm honest with you, I connect a little bit more on that
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.860]   side.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:49.900]   I realize that so often my thinking is so self-centered and not other-centered.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.380]   And I realize that if we could flip that around and begin to love in the only ways that Christ
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:38:00.260]   has loved us, which is always other-centered, never for his gain, but for ours, man, could
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:05.060]   you imagine what the world would be like if we could live like that?
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:10.620]   See, it's that kind of love that enables you to turn the other cheek.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.740]   It's that kind of love that enables you to embrace an enemy.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:19.420]   It's that kind of love that causes you to take your cloak off and give it to someone.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:24.960]   It's that kind of love that actually asks you to repent of your sin.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:31.180]   It's that kind of love that causes you to give to those who could never repay you.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:35.780]   It's that kind of love that causes you to get on your knees and to pray for this world.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:43.140]   It's that kind of love that is other-centered focus that changes it all.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.340]   And it's really important that you understand that this is not a soft love.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.340]   No.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:51.820]   Agape love is not the kind of love that just kind of lies down and lets everything walk
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.820]   over it.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:58.020]   It's not the kind of love that tolerates everything, that kind of allows everything to happen.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.420]   It's not the kind of love that denies yourself nothing.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:08.180]   No, this kind of love, as Paul describes, it rejoices with the truth.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.620]   It does not delight, he says, with evil.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.820]   So this is not a love that just basically says to the church, "Hey, just treat everybody
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:19.340]   how whatever and just everything goes and there's nothing bad in the world and don't
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.340]   be mean to..."
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.440]   Well, you shouldn't be mean to anyone.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.580]   It's the kind of love that's not so soft and whimsical that it's like, "Hey, anything goes.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.020]   Just live your life and it's cool.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.020]   Be your truth."
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.020]   No.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:35.820]   It's the kind of love that rejoices with truth of God, that rejoices with scripture and the
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:41.740]   promises of God, that actually understands that and doesn't delight in the distortions
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:46.740]   of those things, doesn't delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:51.460]   It's the kind of love that actually causes us to say, "Hey, I love you doesn't mean I
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.120]   accept everything that comes out of your mouth, everything that you do.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.740]   My love of you, my agape of you doesn't mean you can just act however you want against
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.740]   me."
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.360]   It's not like a soft love.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:10.180]   It is a robust, beautiful, tough, run through the church towards the broken kind of love
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:15.340]   that stands for the truth of God's word even when that might come at a cost.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.700]   Oh, a cost.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:23.460]   Maybe agape love is sown more beautifully in cost than in anything else.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:27.940]   When we're found in those moments, it changes everything for us.
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:33.780]   And I remember the great privilege I had of standing next to that man as he wept the horror
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:39.220]   of 20 years of being a homicide detective out of himself whilst he was being administered
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:46.300]   to by a nun, unadulterated agape love.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.420]   The man just sat there for about half an hour after we prayed for him just on his own, just
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.700]   weeping and gently being ministered to.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:58.060]   The nun took me to the side and as she went to the side, she reached into her habit and
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.860]   she pulled out this.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.860]   She pulled out a pendant.
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.300]   This is the exact pendant that she pulled out.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:11.780]   And in Spanish, she explained something about this pendant that I will never know.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.500]   But apparently it was very important.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:19.700]   And she placed it in my hand like this and she clasped her hand over my hand.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:24.900]   And she said something in Spanish which I assume was, "I want you to take this to remember
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.660]   this moment of love."
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.620]   As I left the church, here's what God was saying to me.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:37.180]   He was saying, "Andrew, I've placed pendants of love around your neck over the years that
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.620]   I'm calling you to take off and give to those around you.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:41.620]   That's agape."
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:48.180]   And as I close our series on Advent, and as we prepare our hearts for Christmas on Wednesday,
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.820]   let me ask you the same thing.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:56.380]   What pendants of love has Christ placed over you over the last number of years that you
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:02.020]   might now be able to remove and give outwardly towards the other?
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:05.580]   Do that and the greatest of these remains.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.220]   Can we pray?
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.620]   Let's pray.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:24.260]   Father, we are deeply grateful that you love with agape love, other-centered, sacrificial,
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.340]   loving in its fullness.
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:34.580]   Lord, we recognize that we have distorted such love and that it's not just the world
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:40.100]   that distorts it, but the church does at times too.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:46.500]   And we recognize, Lord, that often we live in a lesser vision of love and that we act
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.460]   out a lesser vision of love.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:56.140]   We recognize that so often we can be selfish, self-centered, that even in pretending to
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:59.700]   be loving, we're actually just looking after ourselves.
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:06.180]   Father, I pray for anyone here this morning where that might be part of their story, that
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:13.540]   they would have the courage today to bring that to you, that in your agape love we would,
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.300]   out of your kindness, be led to repentance.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:21.620]   Lord, I recognize also that there's people in this room watching online in our overflow
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:30.260]   who have been hurt by broken love, who somebody else's brokenness of love has acted upon them
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.500]   in ways that has deeply hurt them.
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:39.260]   Father, I pray for anyone here where that's their story, and because of how broken love
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.900]   has impacted them, they have been loving brokenly themselves.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:48.340]   Father, we do know that we are able to love because you first loved us, and I pray that
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.580]   if there's anyone in this room where that's a bit of their journey or a bit of their story
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:57.460]   right now, they've been broken and hurt by love, and they find that they're swept up
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.060]   in that story.
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:05.460]   I want to pray, Lord, that your Spirit, which you have poured out in this time, in this
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:10.500]   now but not yet time between your birth and your return, I pray that that Spirit and the
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:18.300]   fruit of that Spirit of love, pure, unadulterated, agape, sacrificial, selfless, other-scented
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:26.740]   love would fall on them, would come up and be birthed within them for your glory.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:31.740]   Lord, I pray for families that have been torn apart by broken love.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:40.380]   Father, I pray for husbands and wives in this room, those that are struggling to love, those
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:47.540]   that perhaps loved before but find themselves without it in this time, marriages that are
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.620]   strained and difficult.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.420]   Lord, we don't downplay that.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.100]   We don't brush over that.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:02.060]   And Lord, we recognize that the only thing that heals that kind of brokenness is the
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:06.780]   kind of love that is seen on the cross of Christ, and a love that brings us once again
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.580]   to the most natural state of what it is to be human.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:16.060]   Lord, I pray for marriages in this room that you would restore agape love in the name of
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.060]   Jesus.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:20.940]   Lord, I pray for businesses and families.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.860]   I pray for relationships that have been strained.
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:29.140]   Lord, we pray that we would be able to become a church that has received such agape love
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:35.860]   ourselves that we cannot but help to move out in that love for the glory of Christ,
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:39.220]   imaging you to the world and not ourselves.
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:45.940]   Lord, as we come to celebrate your birth on Wednesday, would it be this agapeness that
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.820]   would mark the Vine Church?
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:52.740]   Would it mark us in the days ahead, and would it mark us as we enter into 2025 and all the
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.540]   things that you have for us ahead?
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.420]   Would we love in the way that you truly called us to love?
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.340]   And we give you glory for this.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.340]   In Jesus' name.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:04.340]   Amen.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:08.380]   Would you stand with me, and we're going to just respond together in a time of worship.
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:09.900]   Amen.
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:11.420]   Amen.
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.980]   [MUSIC]
