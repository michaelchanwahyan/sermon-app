1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Hey, as you sit down, why don't you turn around and say hi to someone. Say, "Hey, nice to meet you. It's great to have you here."

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,920
 Oh, so good.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,420
 We are so good.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,480
 Well, welcome to the Vine. I am so glad you're here.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,560
 My name is Andrew. I'm one of the pastors here, and we are so glad you're a part of this, that you're at our 11 o'clock.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,340
 We got 9, 15, 11, and 2 here on a Sunday.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,680
 And I could not be more excited for what I want to share with you today.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,300
 You know, I think there's been a really growing sense of God's presence in his house. Amen.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,880
 And I think when God moves by his Spirit,

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,180
 it's because he has something important that he wants to bring to us.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,400
 That there is life and life abundant in the reality of God's presence, in the Spirit that's at work with us,

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,720
 and in what he does through us, and in particular what he does through a flip chart.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,440
 Can we have a round of applause for the amazing

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,420
 work that Ben and the team do, and the anointing presence of a flip chart.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,500
 I want to take you today into

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,620
 what I consider actually the most important and fundamental posture

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,960
 that I think God has for the global church right now.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,640
 And I think is the number one characteristic of

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,680
 human life that he wants you to learn in, grow in, and manifest

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,480
 as you live here in Hong Kong in this

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,940
 incredibly important hour of Hong Kong's history.

22
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:36,960
 I want to say this, there has never been a more important time to be a Christian in Hong Kong than right now.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,080
 That did not get the reaction I was hoping for.

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,340
 I'm gonna say it one more time.

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:50,600
 There has never been a more important time to be a believer of Jesus in Hong Kong than right now.

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,820
 You are still here.

27
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,380
 You did not move to Singapore.

28
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:05,180
 I am so glad that you are still here, because there's work to be done. Amen.

29
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,660
 Like honestly, there's never more an exciting time for the gospel to be at work in our city.

30
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:17,660
 But I also know this, that unless we manifest this certain characteristic in us that I'm gonna talk about today,

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,820
 I think we're gonna fail to move in the spirit that I think God has for us in our city in this hour.

32
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,620
 I mean, let's be honest.

33
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,780
 The last three years have been brutal here.

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,180
 The last three years have been tough.

35
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:37,420
 I mean, we've all been through it. The social unrest and all of that did, and creating divisions, not just in our society,

36
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,780
 but in our families.

37
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,820
 The government policies and processes in response to that, whether we agreed with or we didn't.

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,100
 A deadly virus that seek to bring us all down, and

39
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,500
 government restrictions and policies that we've either agreed with or we haven't agreed with.

40
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,140
 Feelings of frustration and anger.

41
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,020
 Feelings of wondering whether we should move to Singapore.

42
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,260
 Feelings of the fact that a lot of our friends did actually move to Singapore, and it's really annoying.

43
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,140
 The fact that we're wrestling with fear and anxiety and doubt and confusion,

44
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,060
 that we wish this would all be over.

45
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,580
 The reality that we're still wearing masks when everybody else in the world is like, "What's a mask?"

46
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,500
 Are you with me?

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,060
 And as I've experienced all of this alongside of you in the last three years and stuff,

48
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:31,740
 I've been able to step back a little bit and notice something that I think is such a fascinating phenomenon in human beings.

49
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,740
 I think it's really interesting to look at the ways in which human beings respond to calamity,

50
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,780
 respond to adversity.

51
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,180
 In the last three years, we've all experienced it globally, and I think, and I'm kind of generalizing a little bit here,

52
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:52,140
 but I think largely you can separate humanity into two camps in terms of how we've responded to the issues of the last three years.

53
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,900
 In the one camp, I would call the majority camp, where the majority of us sit.

54
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,140
 And in this camp, we've experienced the calamity, we've experienced all the things that have happened,

55
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,460
 and it's overwhelmed us, and it's hurt us, and we've been lost at sea, and we've struggled to find roots in it,

56
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,860
 and we've asked the big questions, the big questions of God, the big questions of ourselves.

57
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,260
 We've wondered, "Should we stay or should we go?"

58
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,180
 We felt the fear, and the anxiety, and the pain that's gone alongside of it.

59
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,020
 And if we're honest with ourselves, it's worn us down, and we come in on a Sunday, and we're exhausted,

60
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,740
 and we just need something to pick us up because it's completely blown us away.

61
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:38,940
 And then there's a minority group of people in the world who have experienced the same exact circumstances,

62
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,700
 who have felt the exact same fears, and anxieties, and depression, and anger,

63
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,900
 who perhaps even still are still feeling the exact pains, and anxieties, and anger.

64
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,860
 And yet these people have seemed to flourish in this time, have actually become more alive.

65
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,300
 This group of people seem to actually be more creative than they've ever been,

66
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,660
 have a perception of the future that is more exciting than it's ever been.

67
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,940
 And you look at these two camps, the majority that are saying, "Oh, woe is me,"

68
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,940
 and the minority who's saying, "I gotta get out there, and I've got to do new things,

69
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,260
 and create new things, and create new business, create stuff that's happening in this world,

70
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,300
 because now in crisis there is great opportunity."

71
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,340
 And you see these two things, and here's the scary thing for me.

72
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,500
 I think of these two things, if you were to look at the church,

73
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,060
 if you were to look at the church in Hong Kong, and the church around the world,

74
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,700
 I would put it to you that Christians are more in the majority camp than they are in the minority camp.

75
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,100
 I mean, if we're honest with ourselves, I think we're more overwhelmed than we are overcoming.

76
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,660
 I think if we're really honest with ourselves, if I was honest with you,

77
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,860
 I've sat in that majority camp for a long time.

78
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,580
 And something about that should wrestle something in us.

79
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,340
 Something about that should actually disrupt something in us.

80
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,300
 How is it that us who have a relationship with Jesus,

81
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,500
 the name that is above every name as we've just passionately sung,

82
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,180
 can realize that when adversity comes, we find ourselves more siding with the majority people?

83
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,300
 And I think actually, and I want to say this,

84
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,220
 I think actually that's having an impact on how people view church.

85
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,540
 I think even for us Christians, church has become more and more in the last year or so,

86
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,460
 the place that we come to in need of desperate respite.

87
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,300
 The place that we come to in desperate need of actually experiencing something.

88
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,020
 The place that we come to out of a weary and tired week,

89
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,820
 where we fall in across the threshold of the church.

90
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,020
 And we're like, for 90 minutes, we can stuff all of our problems,

91
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,620
 all of our anxieties of the world, the big, nasty, horrible world out there.

92
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,740
 And church has become for us a place of refuge and respite.

93
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,020
 And we need it for our healing.

94
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,940
 And if I don't have my church, I'm going to die.

95
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,060
 And I see all that.

96
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,940
 And I want you to hear this.

97
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,060
 God has used the church like that for over 2000 years.

98
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,540
 I don't want you to hear me wrong here.

99
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,220
 Church is an amazing place of respite and release.

100
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,300
 Church is a place that you can come to when you're feeling exhausted and tired and weary.

101
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,100
 And it's a place where you can receive healing and transformation.

102
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,900
 In fact, if that's how you're feeling in the room right now,

103
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,100
 I want you to know, or even online, you're in a safe place.

104
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,940
 You're here in the place where the Holy Spirit moves to take weary and tired people

105
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,100
 and help them to find their feet again, so they can go back out into the world.

106
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,860
 Here at the Vine, that's been a part of our DNA for 27 years.

107
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,980
 God has always called us as a church to be like a hospital.

108
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,700
 To walk with broken, hurting people.

109
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,580
 People who don't know whether they can survive another day.

110
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,780
 Our passion is to come alongside of you and walk with you in your pain and your hurt.

111
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,460
 That's absolutely who we are.

112
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,740
 But I also feel it's important to say this.

113
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,540
 That the body of Christ is not just a place that you go to,

114
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,100
 to find respite and a safe haven from the nasty troubles of life.

115
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,100
 The church should also be a place where you go to,

116
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,300
 to be strengthened to overcome the troubles of life.

117
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,540
 The church should also be a place where when you come in there,

118
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,420
 there is such a sense of God's presence in you,

119
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,220
 that when you leave here, you don't leave here just going like,

120
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,340
 "Oh no, I've got to face a whole nother horrible week out there."

121
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,300
 But you leave here going, "That's where I'm supposed to be."

122
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,580
 That that place out there is actually the thing that brings me alive.

123
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,460
 And I come in on a Sunday for 90 minutes to connect with people,

124
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,140
 to share the passion of what we're doing.

125
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,700
 But actually this isn't life, that is life.

126
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,940
 This isn't the hope of the world.

127
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,300
 The hope of the world is out there.

128
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,140
 The Spirit is at work in my city.

129
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,700
 He's in work in my neighborhood, in my workplace, in my school.

130
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,740
 And I get to carry his light in that very place.

131
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,500
 I mean, could you imagine a church where we don't just bandage each other's wounds,

132
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,660
 as important as that is, but we actually stoke each other's fire.

133
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,820
 That we actually come around each other and say, "Your life matters."

134
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,500
 That you have a value, that you contribute something to this world.

135
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,700
 You're an image of God, unlike any other image.

136
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,180
 My passion for you as a pastor, I have dedicated and I will dedicate myself

137
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,900
 to walking with you in the worst moments of your life.

138
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,260
 I will walk with you when your world falls apart.

139
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,380
 I've been doing it now for 15 years here at the Vine.

140
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,980
 What a privilege it is to walk with you when things are really tough,

141
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,700
 when adversity is on you, when you're overwhelmed.

142
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,220
 But I will also make this commitment that I will dedicate myself to also challenging you.

143
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,260
 To also speaking truth into you.

144
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,580
 To also actually stretching you.

145
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,780
 To also asking you to choose the hard path.

146
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,300
 To actually challenging you to have the courage to live a life

147
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,540
 that will require you to have courage.

148
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,420
 I'm the sort of person who wants to get around you and say,

149
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,940
 "Actually, the way you're living right now, I can see a different future for you.

150
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,540
 I can see something else in you."

151
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,420
 And I believe the Holy Spirit is moving and working and shaping in you.

152
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,700
 In other words, I have a passion for you to be in the minority camp.

153
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,980
 For you to be men and women of faith.

154
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,500
 That no matter what adversity comes, what hardship comes,

155
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,820
 no matter what might befall your life, you may still feel overwhelmed.

156
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,620
 You may still feel the fear and feel the anxiety.

157
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,540
 But you feel also something else rising up inside of you.

158
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,740
 And you say, "Because of Christ Jesus, this is not going to be the end of me."

159
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,420
 "Because of Christ Jesus, I'm able to overcome whatever calamity might be coming against me."

160
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,020
 "That we might see the church shift from the majority culture to the minority culture."

161
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,380
 "And be a place where everybody else in the culture looks to it and says,

162
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,660
 'They're experiencing the same suffering that we're experiencing, and yet they're alive. Why?'"

163
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,420
 Is it just me that's excited about this?

164
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,180
 Come on, church.

165
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,260
 I'm sweaty already.

166
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,020
 I've only just begun.

167
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,740
 That was my intro.

168
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,980
 So, if that all's true, here's the million dollar question, right?

169
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,340
 The million dollar question is this.

170
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,780
 What secret ingredients is there in the human life

171
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:10,380
 that can enable us to shift from that majority culture of being overwhelmed and stressed and

172
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:16,540
 anxious into the minority culture that despite feeling that way, I still find myself flourishing?

173
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,100
 What's the secret ingredients?

174
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:26,140
 Well, over the last 50 years, sociologists, psychiatrists, those that are cultural commentators,

175
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,860
 they've actually found that there is a singular characteristic of humanity.

176
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,780
 That those who have this characteristic are able to overcome adversity far greater than

177
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,580
 those that do not.

178
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,380
 You want to know what it is?

179
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,060
 Resilience.

180
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,700
 It's the word resilience.

181
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,500
 Now, resilience was originally a word that was coined by engineers.

182
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,580
 It was a word that they decided to use to describe a certain material that when you

183
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,700
 get this material, if you try to bend it and twist it all out of its shape, it will eventually

184
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,140
 bounce back to its old original form.

185
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,260
 So, there are these materials in the world where you can take environments and twist

186
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,620
 and change that material and try to get it to fit something else.

187
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,620
 But as soon as the environment lifts off it or the pressure lifts off it, that material

188
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,500
 will bounce itself back to being originally how it was created to be in the first place.

189
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,260
 And over the last 20 years or so, psychologists and therapists and researchers have begun

190
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:30,140
 to take that word that was started in the engineering world and apply it to human behavior.

191
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,060
 And saying there are some human beings that no matter what environment might come against

192
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,900
 them, no matter how that environment might try to twist them and shape them and change

193
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,180
 them and cause them to move to Singapore, there's another group of people that are

194
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,780
 able to find themselves rooted in life and are able, no matter the shaping of society,

195
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,700
 to bounce back to originally how they were created to be.

196
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,660
 That's resilience.

197
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,300
 And if there's one thing that I think the church in Hong Kong needs in this hour, in

198
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,340
 this time of history, it is resilience.

199
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,580
 In fact, you should be thinking to yourself, "If I want to actually be the strongest person

200
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,940
 that I can be, if I can live the best life that I can be, if I'm going to dedicate

201
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,820
 myself to being the most inspiring and creative that God can enable me to be, well then I

202
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,780
 better be investing in strengthening resilience in my life."

203
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,660
 And the lucky thing for us as Christians is that the Bible is filled with stories about

204
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,060
 men and women experiencing resilience.

205
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,940
 Now the word resilience, because it's a modern day word, is not found in Scripture, but the

206
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,780
 idea of this bouncing back to how we were originally created to be is filled in the

207
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,380
 pages of the Old Testament and the New Testament.

208
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,700
 I want to read one particular passage that I'm so super excited about that I've been

209
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,740
 actually sitting in for a long period of time in the last number of months.

210
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,460
 Is everybody okay?

211
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,820
 Are you still here?

212
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,260
 Are you ready?

213
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,380
 We're opening God's Word.

214
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,260
 You must be excited.

215
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,460
 This is Proverbs 24 verse 16.

216
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:11,580
 It says this, "For though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again.

217
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,820
 But the wicked are brought down when calamity strikes."

218
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,460
 Let me read this again.

219
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,780
 "For though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again.

220
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,780
 But the wicked are brought down when calamity strikes."

221
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,980
 I love the Proverbs.

222
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,220
 Now when you read the Proverbs, you have to have an interpretive tool and technique.

223
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,300
 And that is you have to understand the assumptions that sit behind each Proverb.

224
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,140
 Because on the Proverbs there's a surface thing, but there's something much deeper that

225
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,180
 sits behind it.

226
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,660
 The surface thing here is this wonderful idea that the righteous are able to rise again.

227
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,860
 Can I have an amen?

228
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,580
 I mean that preaches, and I'm going to be preaching that in just a few moments.

229
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,620
 Don't you worry.

230
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,660
 I mean it's amazing to think that we as the righteous people get to rise again.

231
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:58,300
 But there's an assumption that first of all sits behind that, that actually this Proverb

232
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,940
 is all about.

233
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,420
 And the assumption is this, the righteous will fall.

234
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,700
 Oh, we don't like to preach about that one so much.

235
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,300
 "We will rise again" preaches much better than "we will fall."

236
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,500
 But I love the fact that the Scriptures don't shy away from the reality of human experience.

237
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,820
 It says here the righteous in the Old Testament understanding, what that means is those of

238
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,860
 us who are in right relationship with God, right relationship with the law, in right

239
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,780
 standing with Him, we will fall.

240
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,780
 We will fail.

241
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,060
 We will stumble.

242
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,340
 We'll get it wrong.

243
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,700
 We'll make mistakes.

244
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,900
 We'll suffer.

245
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,660
 It will be overwhelming for us.

246
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,140
 The Proverb writer is telling us.

247
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,860
 And this actually grates against everything we think, because we actually think that the

248
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,460
 very posture of the unrighteous is that they fail.

249
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:52,620
 We think it's the unrighteous who fall and suffer, and that it's the righteous who actually

250
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,220
 experience great things in life.

251
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,620
 We think that if we're Christians, we're living in the blessing of God.

252
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,740
 And if we live in the blessing of God, everything's going to be kumbaya.

253
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,580
 And the writer here is trying to help us to understand that the world is a little bit

254
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,860
 different to that.

255
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:15,660
 Whether you're righteous or you're unrighteous, you're going to experience the same thing.

256
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,100
 Oh, man, that's not a positive message.

257
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,060
 But here's the challenge for us.

258
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,340
 The challenge is, is that I think for many of us, this actually begins to create and

259
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,700
 stir in us something that we really need to sit with.

260
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,380
 Notice that he says here, not only are they going to fall, but he says you're going to

261
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,060
 fall seven times.

262
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,980
 Now, whenever the Old Testament mentions seven, you should take note of it.

263
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,740
 Seven is a very important word in Hebrew.

264
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,580
 It's a very important word in their culture.

265
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,300
 It means basically perfection, but it also means infinity.

266
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,020
 So if the writer wasn't hard enough on you, he's being even harder now.

267
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,540
 Because he's saying, not only are you going to fail once in your life, you're going to

268
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,820
 fail for infinity.

269
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,980
 In other words, you're going to fail and then fail and then fail, and then it's going to

270
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,380
 suck.

271
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,820
 And then you're going to fail some more.

272
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,860
 And then after that, you're going to make a mistake and you're going to fail again.

273
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
 And he's basically saying not seven times.

274
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,380
 He's using this as an expression of saying, here's what it's like for the righteous.

275
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,740
 We're always struggling.

276
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,860
 We're always failing.

277
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:20,700
 It always seems like we're losing, which is really an interesting thought.

278
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,260
 Because if that's the reality, here's the question I've got.

279
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,740
 Why should we even be righteous if we're going to fall?

280
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,300
 Have you ever thought about that?

281
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,220
 I mean, why should I even be righteous if it's true that I'm going to fall?

282
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,540
 That's a great question.

283
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:42,220
 It's a question that actually sits under a really faulty theological framework.

284
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,860
 That I would actually say that the majority of us in this room, myself included, so often

285
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,940
 struggle with and causes a huge amount of spiritual anxiety in our lives.

286
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,860
 I want to break this down for you.

287
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,100
 I want to show you what the proverb writer is trying to say.

288
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,700
 Is this helping anyone so far?

289
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,140
 I'm about to use the flip chart.

290
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,100
 It's about to get deep.

291
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,980
 I'm starting with this.

292
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,620
 Okay.

293
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,860
 There is this thing called good faith.

294
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,500
 And what we think under this faulty theological framework is that if we have good faith, then

295
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,180
 we're going to have an easy life.

296
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,940
 Come on, church.

297
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,740
 Don't be shy.

298
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,980
 And we think that if we have bad faith or no faith perhaps at all, then that's going

299
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,300
 to equal a hard life.

300
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,020
 Now when I point it out as basic as that, you're probably sitting there going, "I don't

301
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,500
 believe that.

302
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,220
 That's not me.

303
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,180
 I don't really believe that."

304
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,460
 But let me ask you something very important.

305
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,700
 The last time the world fell out from under you, did you wonder where God was?

306
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,940
 Did you wonder why you as a Christian was suffering so much?

307
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,420
 Have you ever asked the question when things are going great in your life, do you think

308
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,660
 it's because you were going to church regularly?

309
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,660
 "Oh, I started to go to church again and I found the person that I fell in love with."

310
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,480
 "Oh no."

311
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,500
 Many of you are like, "That hasn't happened to me yet.

312
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,220
 That's like a suffering I'm going through right now."

313
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,900
 It's interesting.

314
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,660
 We might look at it like this and say, "No, Andrew, that's not the theological framework

315
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,220
 I have."

316
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,700
 But when we begin to dig into how we respond in adversity, we can go, "Hmm."

317
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,740
 And the problem with writers writing this and the reason why it doesn't sit with us

318
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,740
 is because we do have this environment and it does create spiritual stress.

319
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,860
 Because when something wrong happens in our lives, we immediately begin to blame our relationship

320
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,460
 with God or we blame God himself.

321
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,500
 And when something goes great in our lives, we immediately think it's because of our great

322
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,060
 relationship with God or because God has blessed us.

323
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,380
 God wants to bless you, absolutely.

324
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:45,180
 But if your theological foundations are as flimsy as this, you're going to have a lot

325
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,180
 of spiritual anxiety in your life.

326
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,020
 And so the writer in Proverbs writes to the church and he says, "You've got to understand

327
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,540
 that this is not true.

328
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,180
 That this actually is not the way the world works."

329
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:01,020
 In other words, the righteous are going to have exactly the same set of circumstances

330
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,220
 as the unrighteous.

331
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,180
 Just because you are righteous doesn't mean that you're going to have a different set

332
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,500
 of circumstances to everybody else.

333
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,540
 The joy of the Christian life is not that you get separate circumstances.

334
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,820
 The joy of the Christian life is that you're a different you in the same set of circumstances

335
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,620
 as everybody else.

336
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:26,300
 The joy of the Christian life is that you become a stronger, better, more faithful person

337
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,020
 in the same experiences as everyone else.

338
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
 That's what it means to be Christian.

339
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,060
 Not that you're not going to have any problems, but that in the problems you are an overcomer.

340
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,660
 You will rise again.

341
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,620
 Oh, that deserves a clap and I'm freaking sweaty.

342
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,120
 Okay.

343
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,920
 All right.

344
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,140
 So here's what the writer of the Proverbs is saying.

345
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:59,020
 He's saying, "Whether you have good faith or whether you have bad faith, the reality

346
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,220
 is," guess what?

347
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,540
 "Life is going to happen to you."

348
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,820
 The good, the bad, and the ugly is going to happen to you.

349
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,340
 The issue is not whether the circumstances are going to change.

350
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:18,540
 What the writer is saying, the wicked, when they are facing calamity, he says, "They

351
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,540
 are brought down."

352
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,860
 He said, "They struggle.

353
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,340
 They find themselves overwhelmed.

354
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,580
 They found themselves not being able to go forward.

355
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,540
 When calamity strikes, the woes of bad faith, the wicked or the unrighteous, they will find

356
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,580
 themselves brought down."

357
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,780
 But he says, "Those of good faith," here's what they're going to do.

358
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,060
 Oh, you just watch.

359
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,380
 They are going to rise again.

360
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,780
 They're going to rise again, not because their circumstances are different, but because

361
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,860
 there's something in their character.

362
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,660
 There's something that the Holy Spirit has created in them.

363
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,780
 There is some strength and some assurity to who they are.

364
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,060
 Oh, they really believe that Jesus is the name above every name.

365
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:01,020
 And because of that, they find themselves facing the same stuff, but they will rise

366
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,660
 again.

367
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,740
 May we rise.

368
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,220
 Think about it.

369
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:15,340
 Think about what God could do with a church that didn't hold on to some faulty theological

370
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:22,620
 thinking, but grounded themselves in the reality that when there is death, there is resurrection.

371
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,940
 That when Paul would write to the church and say, "I'm willing to take the dying side,"

372
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,740
 so you would know the rising side.

373
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:39,100
 So that we would come to understand what it is to sit in the glory of a risen Jesus.

374
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,660
 Oh, man, that's good.

375
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,900
 That's what I want for us.

376
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,740
 That's what I want for you.

377
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,060
 I don't want you when calamity strikes to be brought down.

378
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,460
 I want you to rise again.

379
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,020
 And I want you to find the hope of that rising again happening in you.

380
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,780
 So the difference between those who have resilience and those that do not is not whether

381
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,820
 they fail or not.

382
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,540
 You will fail.

383
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,820
 The difference between those that have resilience or not is found in the fact that when they

384
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,700
 fall, they will rise one more time than they fell.

385
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,540
 That's the difference.

386
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,740
 And that's what the scriptures are calling us into.

387
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:23,020
 That's what we're invited into by his power and by his name, that we would find in ourselves

388
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,740
 such resilience.

389
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,420
 And here's the million-dollar question.

390
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,060
 "Pastor Andrew, how do we find that resilience in us?

391
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,660
 Where does it come from?"

392
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
 All right, good question.

393
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,020
 Let me tell you, and you're not going to like this.

394
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,940
 This is really tough.

395
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,300
 It's in the falling.

396
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,980
 It's in the failing.

397
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,740
 It's in the suffering.

398
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,900
 It's in the stumbling.

399
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,340
 It's in the calamity.

400
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,620
 And it's in you being overwhelmed that resilience is created within you.

401
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,540
 I mean, I would love to stand here and tell you that actually the way you get resilience

402
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,420
 is you read this book.

403
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,420
 I would love to stand here and tell you that there are three easy steps to getting resilience

404
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:03,980
 in your life.

405
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,660
 I wish I could tell you to study a course or to read a paper.

406
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,940
 And that's magically how God downloads resilience in your life.

407
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,020
 But the only way resilience is formed and shaped in you is as you walk through the valley

408
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,260
 of the shadow of death, as you go through the things that are overwhelming in your life,

409
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,300
 and he begins to work by his Holy Spirit a resilience that could not have been there

410
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,780
 unless you had gone through it in the first place.

411
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:32,140
 And if that is the case, then we should be leaning into this hour of Hong Kong's history

412
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,180
 like never before.

413
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,300
 If that's the case, we should be grateful for all that we've experienced in the last

414
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,540
 few years, as hard as it's been.

415
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,700
 We shouldn't be a defeated church.

416
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,460
 We should be a resurrected church.

417
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,380
 Now, here's another interesting thought.

418
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:55,820
 The reality is, if you're anything like me, you actually kind of want an easy life.

419
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,700
 You actually kind of want to just chill out for a bit because it's been really hard.

420
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,940
 Anyone else resonate with that?

421
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,020
 I mean, it's been really hard the last three years.

422
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,900
 I mean, it's been difficult.

423
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,460
 It's been hard.

424
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,420
 It's been painful.

425
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,180
 I mean, I want to just have a break.

426
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,460
 I want to do less.

427
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,260
 I actually don't want to press in and do more.

428
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,100
 Pastor Andrew, if you understood my life, I need a pina colada in Bali right now.

429
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,940
 That's what I need.

430
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,820
 I want to do less.

431
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,180
 I want to touch back.

432
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,540
 I want to cut down.

433
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,180
 And I get it.

434
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,060
 I understand it.

435
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,940
 But here's the reality.

436
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,380
 We're so focused in this life of trying to reduce our stress when I think we should be

437
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,580
 more focused in this life in trying to increase our resilience.

438
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,100
 We spend so much time trying to do less or trying to reduce our anxiety and our stress

439
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,140
 when actually maybe what we need to do is invest more in resilience.

440
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,060
 We need to actually work ourselves into the things that God is doing and notice what the

441
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,740
 Spirit of God is doing amongst them.

442
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,620
 And I think this is so important right now because I don't want you to be the second

443
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,540
 half of Proverbs 24 16.

444
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,540
 I don't want you to be a person that when calamity comes, you're overwhelmed.

445
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,180
 Have you ever noticed how calamity doesn't send you an email to warn you that it's coming?

446
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,220
 It's like tomorrow, your life is going to fall apart.

447
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,140
 Just want you to know so you can get prepared, right?

448
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,580
 Calamities happen to us.

449
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,180
 And so where is the preparation?

450
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,740
 Because we can't really be prepared because it could happen anytime.

451
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,540
 The preparation comes when the Spirit of God is at work in us.

452
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,700
 And we choose a life where courage is demanded.

453
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,340
 We choose a life where we have to have resilience in order for us to thrive.

454
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,540
 Where we align ourselves to the work that the Holy Spirit is doing in our city.

455
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,580
 I mean, could it be?

456
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,460
 Think about this church.

457
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:43,260
 Could it be that the very challenging circumstances of the last three years here in Hong Kong

458
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:50,620
 was actually God's plan to forge the level of resilience that is going to be needed in us

459
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,340
 for the very real challenges ahead?

460
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,700
 I mean, think about Hong Kong.

461
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,180
 Think about the church here.

462
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,980
 Think about what the years ahead could be like for us.

463
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,900
 Could it be that there is now a resilience in us that wasn't in there three years ago?

464
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,860
 Could it be that God's character has shifted and changed something inside of us

465
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:16,060
 that we might now be able to take our feet and root them in the hope of the gospel like never before?

466
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,740
 Could it be that the church's time is now?

467
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,980
 Could it be that there's no greater time to be a Christian in Hong Kong than right now?

468
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,940
 Interesting thing is this is not the only time in history

469
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,140
 where God's church has faced the hardest of challenges.

470
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,740
 This is not the only time where things have been overwhelming and difficult for the church.

471
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,860
 In fact, the New Testament is a story of a church overwhelmed.

472
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,260
 It's a story of a church where many people in that church wanted an easier life.

473
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,580
 They wanted to check out a little bit.

474
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,060
 They didn't want the hardness of having to go in front of a whole empire

475
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,100
 with a belief that Jesus was the way, the truth, and the life.

476
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,980
 And it was difficult to be a Christian in the first century.

477
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,100
 I want to read you just two examples of how this is really important.

478
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,820
 James chapter 1, starting in verse 2, says this.

479
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,580
 "Consider it pure joy."

480
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,460
 He starts like this.

481
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,820
 "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, when you face trials of many kinds,

482
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,100
 because you know that the testing of your faith develops."

483
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,740
 Here it is.

484
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,540
 "Perseverance."

485
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,020
 That's the biblical word for resilience.

486
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,660
 "It creates perseverance in us, and perseverance must finish its work

487
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,460
 so that you might be mature and complete, not lacking in anything."

488
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,540
 James writes to the church,

489
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,060
 a church that wants to run in the other direction and move to Singapore.

490
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,860
 And he says, "No!

491
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,340
 You're going to root yourself in the ground right here and right now."

492
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,660
 And in fact, I want you to reframe how you think about all the stuff that's happening to you.

493
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,300
 I want you to consider it pure joy when you face challenges,

494
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,820
 because your challenges will test your faith.

495
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,500
 And when it tests your faith,

496
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,020
 you will be able to discover whether you have strong roots or weak roots.

497
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,300
 And if you're found having weak roots, then you can do something about it.

498
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,380
 And if you found that you've got strong roots,

499
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,780
 you can praise God that he's made them in your life.

500
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,260
 And he says, "Out of this, you will become mature."

501
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,260
 He's like, "I don't want an immature church," James is saying.

502
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:14,540
 "I don't want it so that when every adversity comes along, you crumble and you fall.

503
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,220
 I want a church that's able to rise again.

504
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,940
 I want a church that can persevere.

505
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,620
 I want a church that has great hope."

506
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,220
 And here's the really, really interesting reflection on that.

507
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,260
 See, the very circumstances and experiences that create resilience in us

508
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,340
 are the very circumstances and experience that we as Christians love to avoid.

509
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,700
 The great irony of all of this is found in this,

510
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,260
 that we so often turn to God to actually deliver us

511
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,620
 from the very circumstances that are required to build resilience in us.

512
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,940
 Have you thought about that?

513
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,860
 We want God to miraculously remove our suffering immediately.

514
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,820
 When perhaps that suffering is there for a purpose, as James said.

515
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,820
 That it's there to actually create some perseverance in you.

516
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,780
 And that perseverance might then change something in you.

517
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,020
 And that then might actually be a greater faith, a more mature faith.

518
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,300
 I love how he says it here, "So you would lack nothing."

519
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:23,100
 Notice how Paul actually puts it in Romans 5, and he says it just as strongly.

520
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:28,140
 Paul, who knew what it is to suffer and prayed for God to miraculously remove his suffering.

521
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,940
 Remember what happened?

522
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,980
 God said, "My grace is sufficient for you."

523
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,300
 That man writes this.

524
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,980
 He says, "We also rejoice in our sufferings,

525
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,940
 because we know that suffering produces perseverance,

526
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,660
 perseverance, character, character, hope.

527
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,660
 And hope does not disappoint us,

528
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,260
 because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit,

529
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,260
 whom He has given to us."

530
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,340
 He's saying, "Hey church, there's suffering out there in the world.

531
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,700
 We're all going to experience it.

532
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,780
 The question is, are we allowing that suffering to form and shape in us

533
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:06,300
 a character trait of resilience that will enable us to move into the hope of Christ Jesus

534
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,340
 in a desperate time and a desperate hour as this?"

535
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,060
 Paul's basically saying, "Are you willing to suffer?"

536
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:18,540
 Because great faith is found through great suffering.

537
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,500
 We don't like to think about that.

538
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,900
 But think about it this way.

539
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,900
 Why do you need great faith if there are not great problems to overcome?

540
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,580
 Some of you in this room, you really do want to have great faith,

541
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,260
 but you don't want to have big problems.

542
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,900
 If you're here today and your prayer is, "God, give me great faith,"

543
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,580
 let me suggest an alternative prayer.

544
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,820
 "God, bring me some problems."

545
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,220
 That's a weird prayer, isn't it?

546
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,340
 But I think God opens up for us a space to be bold before Him.

547
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,220
 During the fifth wave, I'm going to close with a story.

548
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,060
 During the fifth wave, my wife and I decided that it would be best to

549
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,500
 get our daughter out of Hong Kong.

550
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,180
 This is right at the high of the fifth wave,

551
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,300
 and government was making some funny decisions, separating families.

552
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,780
 We thought this was just a bit unsafe for her.

553
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,820
 And so we decided that Chris, who's from New Zealand,

554
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,940
 would move to New Zealand for a few months, take Mia with her,

555
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,820
 and they would be nice and safe, and I would remain back here.

556
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,580
 So they went to New Zealand.

557
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,500
 And when I said goodbye to them at the airport,

558
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,260
 this immediate thought went through my head,

559
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,180
 "They're never coming back."

560
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,740
 This is like, they're Singapore, right?

561
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,540
 They're moving out of Hong Kong to New Zealand.

562
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,060
 I don't know if you've ever been to New Zealand,

563
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,340
 but if you want an easy life, that's the place to go to, okay?

564
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,740
 If you want to check out a life, go to New Zealand.

565
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,780
 You just chill out there, the sheep and everything, it's awesome.

566
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,540
 And my wife, by her very nature,

567
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,820
 this is her happiest day, a book, a glass of wine, and no human beings.

568
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,100
 You give her that, she comes alive.

569
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,380
 She's always said to me, in all the 24 years of our marriage,

570
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,180
 she said, "Andrew, I just want a small life.

571
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,740
 "I just want a small life."

572
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,580
 So she's down there in New Zealand, enjoying her small life,

573
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,620
 chilled out to the max.

574
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,260
 She's sending me photos of them with no masks on,

575
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,620
 enjoying their life.

576
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,420
 I'm back here, thinking that this is a multiverse, alternate reality over there.

577
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,980
 And I knew that I was going to get a phone call at some point from Chris,

578
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,500
 and she's going to be saying something like,

579
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,860
 "Well, I've been praying, Andrew.

580
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,220
 "And I feel like the Holy Spirit is suggesting this.

581
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,420
 "And sure enough, after about two months,

582
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,580
 "I get the phone call and she starts it,

583
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,700
 "'I've been praying, honey.'

584
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,540
 "And I sense the Holy Spirit is saying this to me."

585
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,620
 He said, "Christine, I want you to have a big life."

586
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:49,260
 Now, I know that's the Holy Spirit,

587
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,820
 'cause that is the very antithesis of the heart of my wife.

588
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,140
 And with tears in her eyes, as we're FaceTiming each other,

589
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,660
 she's like, "It goes against everything

590
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,140
 "that I think in my spirit I want,

591
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,620
 "but I know it is God's Word."

592
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,140
 She said, "Why would I ever settle for anything less?

593
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,860
 "Than the biggest life God could give me."

594
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,980
 And I knew at that moment, she was going to come back.

595
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,380
 (audience laughing)

596
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,340
 I want to say this to you.

597
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,220
 Matthew, when he was speaking to his disciples in Matthew 7,

598
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:22,940
 he said it this way.

599
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,700
 He said, "Wide is the gate, and broad is the path

600
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,980
 "that leads to destruction, and many enter that way.

601
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,300
 "But small is the gate, and narrow is the path

602
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,460
 "that leads to life, and only a few find it."

603
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,780
 Would you be in the few?

604
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,940
 I want you to rise again.

605
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,860
 I want you to choose the narrow path.

606
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,500
 Do not choose to settle.

607
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,620
 Do not choose to just reduce your stress

608
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,100
 without increasing your resilience.

609
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:01,660
 Make it your greatest ambition to live such a courageous life

610
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,100
 that it will demand resilience in your character.

611
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,540
 You have been created for nothing less

612
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,260
 than the best of what God has for you.

613
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,820
 And everything you've gone through in the last three years

614
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,300
 has been his shaping and his moulding

615
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,540
 because you are made of the material

616
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,420
 that will bounce back to its original form.

617
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,980
 And because of that, you can stand in this city

618
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,540
 in its desperate hour of need and say, "There is hope."

619
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,780
 May we rise.

620
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,980
 Amen, amen.

621
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,660
 (congregation applauding)

622
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,260
 So may we rise as I pray for us now.

623
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,260
 Father, I am so grateful.

624
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,020
 I'm so grateful for each person here,

625
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:54,380
 for each person who's a part of this community of faith,

626
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,860
 whether in this room or online.

627
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,780
 And Father, I wanna pray right now for each one.

628
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,180
 Whether you're comfortable,

629
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,620
 maybe you could just open your hands again,

630
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,780
 whether you're here in this room or online in this moment.

631
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,580
 And as you open your hands,

632
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,660
 you're just coming in that posture before the Lord.

633
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,660
 And like I've been saying in this message,

634
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,620
 if you're in a place where you feel overwhelmed and anxious,

635
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,660
 you're in the right place.

636
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,180
 His church for 2000 years

637
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,260
 has been a place of healing and ministry.

638
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,260
 And after the surface,

639
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,020
 you have great opportunity to come forward

640
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,940
 and receive prayer from any of our prayer team

641
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,860
 who would love to stand with you,

642
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,700
 speak life over you,

643
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,220
 bandage your wounds in prayer and love on you.

644
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,700
 And if that's you, you're in the right place.

645
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,260
 But we've also been seeing in this message

646
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,460
 that the Holy Spirit is also at work,

647
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,220
 not just bandaging our wounds,

648
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,740
 but taking us through the experiences of life

649
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,180
 so that we might rise again,

650
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,060
 so that we might find in ourselves the resilience

651
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,540
 to rise one more time than we fail.

652
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,900
 That no matter how hard things might get,

653
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,740
 our suffering might produce some perseverance,

654
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,100
 perseverance, character, character, hope.

655
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,820
 And we know hope will not disappoint

656
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,420
 as the love of Jesus is poured into us by the Holy Spirit.

657
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,020
 That we might consider it pure joy

658
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,540
 that we still live in Hong Kong.

659
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,540
 That our hearts might be turned to our city in this time.

660
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,180
 That we might celebrate the reality

661
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,300
 that we're still here and that we are rising again.

662
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,900
 Lord, I wanna pray for each one of us.

663
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,140
 Lord, this is not the kind of message

664
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,300
 where we give three points

665
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,980
 of how to build resilience this week.

666
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,100
 It's not the kind of message

667
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,860
 where we recommend a book to read.

668
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,820
 This is the kind of message

669
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,900
 where there's hard truth and a prophetic call.

670
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,460
 The hard truth that life happens

671
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,540
 and we have the choice whether we will rise or fall.

672
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,060
 The prophetic call that we would choose life,

673
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,500
 the narrow path,

674
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,780
 that we would find the way of Jesus and not shy from it.

675
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,460
 The joy of what it is to be resilient

676
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,500
 before the work of the enemy in this world.

677
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,900
 That we would find the blood of Christ

678
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,180
 strengthening our hands for the battles that are before us.

679
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,860
 And like we sang earlier,

680
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,740
 that our posture in battle is prayer.

681
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:27,180
 And Father, I wanna pray for the resilience

682
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,780
 that you want for the Vine Church.

683
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,300
 (gentle music)

684
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,900
 As I was praying for this service and for this message,

685
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,740
 I saw a picture of a baby in a swaddling clothes.

686
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
 You know that time when you wrap a baby up,

687
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,540
 a toddler really uptight so they can't move,

688
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,300
 so they can sleep and feel safe.

689
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,980
 And I felt like the Holy Spirit rebuke me

690
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,500
 and say that, "Andrew, your spirituality

691
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,820
 "is so often like that since you've emerged from COVID.

692
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,740
 "You just want me to wrap you up."

693
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,820
 "Protect you from the big nasty world."

694
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,060
 But he said, "It's time for me

695
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,900
 "to unravel the swaddling clothes."

696
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,380
 Children have to push out eventually

697
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,140
 from that comfortable environment.

698
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,940
 And they have to fight out and they'll cry

699
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,460
 and the parents will wish that they could just

700
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,540
 wrap them back up again in the swaddling clothes.

701
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,500
 But the child needs to develop, it needs to fight,

702
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,060
 it needs to find its strength, it needs to mature.

703
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,140
 And I feel like the Holy Spirit is saying that over me

704
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,060
 and he's saying that over us as a church.

705
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,620
 He said, "The swaddling clothes are done with.

706
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,140
 "It's time to mature."

707
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,220
 Paul, writing to the church in Corinth said,

708
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,380
 "Oh, at the beginning I gave you milk,

709
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,140
 "but now you need meat."

710
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,100
 And Lord, I pray that each person here

711
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,540
 would, as James prays,

712
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,100
 would find themselves maturing in you

713
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,340
 so that they would lack nothing.

714
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,780
 Lord, would we be a church of resilience

715
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,860
 so that we would be the non-anxious presence

716
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,180
 that you want us to be in our city?

717
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,340
 I wonder if you'd just take a moment

718
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,460
 to continue to receive from him.

719
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,500
 We don't need to rush.

720
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,380
 The team are gonna now lead us in a time of worship,

721
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,340
 but just keep your hands open and your spirit supple

722
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,700
 to how the Spirit of God wants to meet you now.

723
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,700
 Wants to meet you now.

724
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,280
 (gentle music)
