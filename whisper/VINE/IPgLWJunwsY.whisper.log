[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   Church, I wanna start out by asking you a question.
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.980]   When was the last time that God asked you a question
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.720]   that totally floored you?
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.020]   A question that so completely caught you off guard?
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.920]   The type of question that just because He asked you,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.780]   you already know what the answer is,
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.860]   but it still deeply challenges you.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.220]   Early one morning at a breakfast in 2012,
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.420]   God asked me one of those questions.
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.100]   And as I was listening to the speaker that morning
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.500]   share his journey to faith, I was a 26 year old.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.380]   And as much as a 26 year old can,
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.460]   I thought I had a pretty good plan
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.700]   for the rest of my life, right?
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.340]   I was working in finance, I was dating the girl
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.540]   that was about to become my wife.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.340]   And over the next 30 years, I had planned
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.540]   to build my resources, to build my relationships,
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.860]   to build my connections to a point that when I hit 55,
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.060]   I could turn that back around
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.900]   and invest it into God's kingdom.
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.700]   In reality though, I was sitting in that chair
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.220]   completely oblivious to the bomb
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.560]   that God was about to drop on me.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.900]   Now, I had been shaping my plan
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.580]   for a couple of years at that point, right?
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.020]   It wasn't like the back of a napkin type of plan
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.660]   that you do when you sit down at a cafe.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.460]   Now, I see I had a two year plan,
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.220]   and that two year plan was going to go
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.380]   into a five year plan.
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.660]   And that five year plan would then set me up
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.180]   for the 30 year plan, okay?
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.620]   I was pretty confident, it was the long game short,
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.340]   but God was gonna support this idea
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.840]   because I was doing it for Him.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.380]   Now, the speaker at that breakfast,
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.620]   he and I had something in common, right?
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.560]   We both thought that the most impacting way
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.380]   that you could get society to see the church
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.740]   was to create something so extravagant
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.580]   that when they laid their eyes on it,
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.740]   they couldn't help but come running to the church
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.380]   to learn more about the God that we serve.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.100]   That perspective is what made hearing the question
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.900]   that God asked me so much harder to hear.
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.140]   It wasn't just because it caught in a doubt,
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.500]   the plan that I had, it caught into doubt
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.280]   the actual purpose that I had, I thought for my life.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.940]   Now, I expect some of you are probably thinking,
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.340]   what is that question that he's talking about?
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.940]   I'd imagine some of you are probably thinking,
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.060]   well, if that question has upended two people's lives
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.820]   already, maybe I don't wanna hear what that question is,
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.820]   but I'm gonna tell you anyway, all right?
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.300]   But I will say this, if there is any upending to happen,
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.180]   we're gonna do that together, all right?
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.060]   I won't take responsibility for it,
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.060]   but I will be with you as you walk through that.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.140]   Does that sound good?
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.180]   - Yes.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.820]   - All right, well, this is it, all right?
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.260]   This is the question that God asked me,
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260]   which really has gone on to define over the last 10 years,
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.860]   what it means for me to live missionally.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.420]   He asked me this question,
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.180]   "Nathan, would you be satisfied with me
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.860]   "if all I ever had for you to do in this life
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.660]   "was to love the person next to you?
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.420]   "If I stripped away all of the plans, all of the ideas,
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.260]   "all the desires that you have to change society,
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.700]   "to give people the opportunities
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.100]   "that you think that they believe,
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.220]   "would you still be satisfied with me?
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.740]   "Instead of the large-scale impact that you wanted to see,
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.780]   "you know, the unraveling of unjust systems that happen,
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.340]   "instead of like bringing large amounts of people to me,
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.260]   "if all I called you to do was love the person next to you,
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.020]   "would you be satisfied with me?"
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.340]   Church, I'm gonna be honest with you,
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.220]   that question hit me like a freight train.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.260]   Yes, and everybody can just turn around
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.180]   'cause this is definitely not water.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.020]   Thank you.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.900]   It's the 11th, so if my voice goes,
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.060]   you guys are getting the best of it, all right?
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.860]   So I answered that question at that point in time
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.620]   because I figured, you know,
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.700]   that God already knew what was happening in my heart.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.780]   There's probably a reason
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.060]   he asked me that question anyway, right?
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.980]   So I answered it as you should, with honesty,
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.220]   and my reply to God was this,
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.380]   no, I don't think that's enough.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.780]   'Cause you see, in my mind,
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.420]   there was too much pain in society, right?
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.900]   There was way too much brokenness.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.180]   There was too many people suffering
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.580]   from physical and spiritual issues.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.580]   And the church, we as Christians, we had only just,
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.140]   we haven't even begun to grasp what it meant for us
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.140]   to be able to reach out to them and meet them in their need.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.900]   Right, I believed that if there was 7.8 billion people
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.820]   on this earth, right,
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.540]   and if 31% of us identified as being Christians,
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.140]   and then I took a really conservative one in five
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.580]   of that 30%, that would give us 480 million people.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.780]   And if there was 480 million people
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.420]   who honestly believed in the full authority of God
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.860]   and the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.180]   then we should be seeing on such a large scale
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.860]   of people's lives being transformed
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.180]   and society turning to Jesus by the masses, right?
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.780]   The church should literally be barnstorming
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.740]   across the world, knocking people out
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.540]   with the transformation that can only come
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.540]   through the gospel, right?
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.300]   That was the mindset that I had.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.060]   And it was the mindset that I wanted the church
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.140]   and Christians to pick up, right?
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.500]   My career was about gaining the knowledge,
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.720]   the resources, the relationships,
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.020]   so that when I hit the halfway mark,
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.820]   I could arrive with all of my giftings
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.500]   and sew that into the kingdom of God.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.700]   From my perspective, right,
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.180]   the world was yet to see what a truly dedicated Christian
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.060]   could achieve.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.540]   And clearly, God had a lot of work to do on me.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.380]   Right, three years later, God reminded me of this question
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.540]   as I was crying my eyes out on a flight to Manila.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.320]   Earlier that day, I was sitting in a jail cell
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.960]   visiting a lady named Grace.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.680]   Grace was being held in a small jail
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.880]   with about 250 other women,
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.240]   probably about the same size of the auditorium here.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.080]   All right, these women were there waiting
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.520]   to have their cases heard before a court.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.080]   They hadn't been trialed yet.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.300]   They hadn't been sentenced yet.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.000]   They hadn't been found guilty.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.440]   All right, they had been arrested,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.160]   either in the act of committing a crime
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.280]   or being under the suspicion of doing something illegal.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.380]   Grace was one of those women who regularly visited
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.540]   by one of our missionaries that came from this church,
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.820]   Adrienne Ida Bell.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.060]   Right, she was a single mother in her 40s,
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.940]   had three children,
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.440]   and had recently lost her husband to cancer.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.900]   And she'd been living in that pretrial jail for two months,
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.500]   waiting to have her case heard in court.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.800]   It was a messy and complicated situation,
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.000]   which only got worse for Grace.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.180]   About two weeks earlier,
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.860]   she went to the local hospital to get some scans done.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.180]   And the doctors there told her at that point,
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.020]   "Grace, you have stage three breast cancer.
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.600]   Now, when you're in that situation,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.660]   treatment options are pretty limited."
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.660]   All right, Grace didn't have the opportunity
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.820]   to go down to the local public hospital to get treatment.
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.240]   All right, she didn't even have the money
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.920]   to hire a personal lawyer, a private lawyer,
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.940]   just to get her court case brought up earlier.
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.820]   She was sitting in that jail cell,
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.820]   watching the days go by with a disease
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.340]   that would end her life without treatment.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.140]   Now, Grace and I shared a connection at that point
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.860]   that rose above our circumstances.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.420]   Our connection went above our languages,
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.620]   it went above our culture,
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.660]   it went above whatever law she may have broken.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.140]   Because as Grace and I sat there in that overcrowded jail,
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.460]   with tears in our eyes,
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.200]   we connected to the very essence of our humanity.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.620]   And responding to somebody who shares with you
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.700]   that they have just had cancer,
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.740]   that's not always an easy thing to do.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.460]   But let me tell you, it's even harder when you,
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.580]   just two years earlier,
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.140]   had the doctors say those same words to you,
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.780]   "Nathan, you have cancer."
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.840]   On the flight out of Iloilo that night,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.680]   as soon as the catalysts went off,
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.820]   I broke down in tears and I grieved for Grace.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.780]   For the fact that she was facing the same uncertainty,
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.780]   the same questions without answers,
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.460]   the same fear that I did,
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.300]   but with the very real probability
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.060]   that unless something significantly changed
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.060]   in the system that she was caught within,
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.260]   that with each day,
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.220]   that sentence was going to become more and more likely
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.900]   to be a death sentence for her.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.940]   Her experience broke me,
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.940]   because even though we shared that cancer journey,
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.260]   it completely contrasted my own.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.780]   My journey with cancer was relatively short-lived.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.420]   It only took a week between the diagnosis
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.660]   to when I was in the hospital getting the tumor removed.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.540]   And I received that amazing treatment
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.900]   for no other reason than the fact
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.140]   that I was born in a privileged country
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.780]   that had fair access to health services.
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.780]   So that night, I got pulled back to the question
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.300]   which God has used to literally shape my understanding
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.220]   of what it means to live missionally.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.380]   If all I ever had for you
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.060]   was to love the person next to you,
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.580]   the person like grace,
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.020]   would you be satisfied?
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.660]   Now, I'm going to make a guess
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.500]   that this probably isn't the typical perspective
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.780]   that you'd expect to hear on a Sunday morning
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.300]   about missions, right?
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.260]   'Cause missions is normally about that external activity.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.820]   The activity where we take our resources,
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.420]   we take our time, we take our experience,
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.540]   and we go somewhere to do something,
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.300]   the physical action out there.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.380]   But I wanted to pick up this question today
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.900]   because what God has shown me since that breakfast is this.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.700]   If we aren't able to internalize
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.980]   what it means to us personally,
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.660]   then we will always struggle to know the difference
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.180]   between doing missions and then living missionally.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.740]   Right, so I want to take a few minutes
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.900]   just to break down that question.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.780]   Is that all right?
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.620]   Good.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.780]   Good, so let me ask you a question then.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.780]   Where are you finding your satisfaction right now?
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.380]   Most of us probably approach that question
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.060]   from the perspective of how are my desires being fulfilled?
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.940]   Right, that's the narrative we experience
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.420]   most commonly around us,
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.540]   the desire to satisfy our personal needs,
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.660]   which includes how we expect people
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.860]   to see and react around us, right?
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.460]   Satisfaction is about fulfilling
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.100]   what feels right and good to me.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.260]   And over the coming days,
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.980]   if you think through this question,
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.700]   I want to give you a little bit of an insight.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.940]   The answers that start to come out from this
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.100]   will be really, really helpful
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.820]   when it comes to your relationship with God
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.980]   because you'll start to see some of those underlying motives
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.540]   that really drive our desires, right?
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.660]   Because the source of our satisfaction,
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.900]   that is so important because where it comes from
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.460]   is where we turn to satisfy ourselves, right?
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.460]   And wherever we get our satisfaction from
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.900]   is what we would desire the most.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.660]   And whatever we desire the most
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.820]   is what shapes our actions, right?
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.340]   Source of satisfaction, forming our desires,
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.700]   shaping our actions.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.100]   And in the context of missions,
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.180]   this process is what determines
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.580]   whether we are building God's kingdom
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.900]   or our own idea of what that should be, right?
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.380]   And you can probably start to see the problem
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.900]   with the perspective that I shared with you earlier, right?
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.260]   'Cause I was looking for satisfaction in the extravagance.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.620]   Right, I wanted to build a kingdom
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.900]   that yes, it reflected elements of God,
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.820]   but it also looked a lot like what Nathan thinks is right.
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.020]   Right, and without that hard turnaround by God,
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.060]   my actions were going to end up driving me
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.780]   further away from his heart
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.940]   and that desire to love the person next to me.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.740]   Now, I want you to see something in this, right?
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.140]   'Cause this process is not just my personal interpretation
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.020]   of an experience that I had, right?
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.460]   Because we also find the same thing in scripture, right?
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.420]   And I'm gonna show you this to you
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.780]   in the first five verses of Isaiah 55.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.220]   I'm gonna read through this, but as I do it,
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.860]   I want you to pay special attention
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.780]   to the way that he describes this process
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.940]   of finding satisfaction, aligning desires,
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.300]   and the resulting actions that come from it.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.780]   Okay, let's go from verse one.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.260]   "Come all who are thirsty, come to the waters,
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.980]   and you who have no money, come buy and eat.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:11.220]   Come buy wine and milk without money and without cost.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.500]   Why spend money on what is not bread
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.180]   and your labor on what does not satisfy?
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.100]   Listen, listen to me and eat what is good,
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.700]   and you will delight in the richest of fair.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.420]   Give ear and come to me.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.100]   Listen that you may live,
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.500]   and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.780]   my faithful love promised to David.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.060]   See how I've made him a witness to the peoples,
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.300]   a ruler and a commander of the peoples.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.100]   Surely you will summon nations you know not,
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.060]   and the nations you do not know will come running to you
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.980]   because of the Lord your God."
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.140]   In this passage, Isaiah is showing us
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.500]   that if we trust God, we will seek our satisfaction in him.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.020]   And in that process of doing that,
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.980]   our desires become more and more aligned with him,
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.060]   which eventually forms the direction for our lives,
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.060]   which is so much more important
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.620]   than just a well-thought-out strategy plan, right?
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.820]   It opens up the opportunity to follow God,
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.140]   to be satisfied in him,
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.940]   and to live that missional lifestyle
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.540]   by being a witness to the people around us.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.980]   So if we believe that mission is about this, right?
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.140]   If we believe it is about living our lives
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.740]   in a way that reflects God's intention
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.340]   and purpose for creation,
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.300]   then we have to recognize that this is only possible
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.460]   by walking in partnership with him.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.100]   Out of that intimacy,
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.100]   we have the opportunity to point others
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.380]   towards a relationship with the creator
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.420]   and to influence the systems of injustice.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.780]   But we can only do that underneath the sovereignty of God.
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.020]   And what I love about this is the reflection that it has
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.260]   with Jesus's ministry here on earth as well, right?
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.220]   When Jesus, he gave us these examples of a special place
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.740]   which we should inhabit as being part of the vine, right?
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.500]   He called us to remain into that place
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.220]   because without being connected to him,
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.140]   not only do we lose our ability to impact the world around us
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.380]   through the leading of the gospel,
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.540]   but we will over time inevitably find a gap growing
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.020]   between our desires and his, right?
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.060]   Having our satisfaction anchored in him
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.820]   is what we need to build healthy relationships with others
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.220]   then that those relationships
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.060]   should then stretch beyond our ideas.
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.980]   And that's important because if you're like me,
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.820]   if I'm not anchored in that satisfaction with God,
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.460]   holding onto it is something
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.220]   which it becomes extremely difficult, right?
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.820]   I wrestle with how this plays out in my life.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.300]   You know, the desire that I have to do more,
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.340]   to produce greater impact, right?
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.260]   To scale up the kingdom of God.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.420]   And the problem that happens is when we let go
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.380]   of that anchor, you start to see exactly what happened
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.680]   in my terrible statistical analysis
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.180]   of the world population earlier, right?
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.860]   I'm buying into my methods.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.900]   I'm trying to leverage of my good ideas,
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.760]   my good intentions, the opportunities to influence people,
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.740]   but it becomes a very slippery slope
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.540]   away from Jesus himself.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:27.220]   When we find more satisfaction in doing things for him
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.840]   as opposed to spending our time with him, right?
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.600]   So for us to liberate people,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.820]   if we want to tear down the systems
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.420]   that oppress and enslave people,
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.620]   we need to have a systematic response.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.300]   Absolutely, right?
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.620]   But it has to come with the transformation
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.600]   of the heart and the mind of the believer.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.900]   Because even if, even if the 480 million people, right?
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.420]   If we all got together and we put our heads down
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.140]   and we did some good things, right?
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.060]   We did some really good things.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.260]   I would say this, at the very best,
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.940]   that would be an incredible social movement,
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.740]   but it would run the risk of losing the actual spirit
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.180]   and the purpose behind it, what actually started.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.620]   I want to give you an example
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.240]   of what this could look like, right?
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.700]   One of the pathways that Michelle mentioned earlier
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.860]   was the idea of creation care, right?
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.100]   Creation care being in essence,
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.220]   you're looking after God's creation, right?
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.660]   And taking responsibilities
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.700]   for either the way that we protect it
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.060]   or the way that we pollute it, right?
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.880]   This year, if you looked around the Vine Center,
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.620]   you have seen a couple of those little
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.460]   recycling bins pop up, right?
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.540]   That came out of an intentional decision
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.760]   that we took as a church
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.180]   to align where we found our satisfaction
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.660]   in the space of caring for God's creation.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.360]   And it spilled over into the way
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.100]   that we do this as a staff as well, right?
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.980]   For our staff, each week, we save our paper,
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.620]   our plastics, our metals, and our glass.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.300]   And then we bring it in to recycle
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.500]   with our partner, Hong Kong Recycles, right?
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.840]   That transformation started in our hearts.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.840]   And now that conviction of the Holy Spirit,
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.820]   it has the potential to change society around us.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.580]   And that's the important part about this, right?
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.460]   Because if we took this as a church,
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.100]   imagine if the Vine did this collectively, right?
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.960]   We didn't just recycle individually.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.200]   We took it to our church.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.060]   I'd sort of, we're already at your church.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.580]   If you took it to your business,
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.060]   if you took it to your school,
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.360]   if it took to the facilities,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.820]   the complexes that we live in,
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.660]   and we all started to recycle,
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.640]   that has the foundations to be growing
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.540]   into something which is so much more.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.380]   And the thing that I love about that,
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.740]   when it comes to this idea of evangelizing,
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.900]   you cannot find an easier platform
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.900]   to sharing why your faith is so important to you
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.020]   than through this type of engagement, right?
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.060]   I do this because of my faith.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.260]   I do this because I care of the environment.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:49.880]   You'll remember from the Alternative Society
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.600]   that this is the exact process
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.420]   that Paul was teaching the church in Philippi, right?
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.260]   By aligning our desires with the greater good
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.100]   of the advancement of the gospel
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.660]   and following God wherever he leads us,
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.700]   we will find the joy in that space
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.620]   as we discover opportunities to lead people around us
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.700]   into a deepening relationship with their creator.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.900]   Okay, I think you've got the point, right?
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.300]   I've shared a little bit about that process in my life.
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.460]   We've unpacked it a little bit within scripture.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.580]   But what I wanna do now is I wanna bring this back
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.900]   to the space where we are right now.
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.640]   I wanna bring this back to you.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.260]   There's a second part to that question
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.540]   that I asked you earlier, right?
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.500]   The second part of this was love the person next to you.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.200]   One of the things that Michelle and I love
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.500]   about being on the missions team
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.960]   is the opportunity that we get along
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.540]   to come alongside of you
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.740]   and walk out the journey that God has for you, right?
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.200]   And we actually designed our approach to missions
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.620]   with that in mind, right?
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.780]   We wanted to equip our church to be informed
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.180]   and resourced to live out their faith
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.820]   in the areas that they are passionate about.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.420]   We do that through our pathways.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.540]   We do that through our partnerships that we have.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.660]   But we also do that by walking that out
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.100]   with you personally, right?
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.060]   In discovering what your missional response can be.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.380]   And that's important for us because the reality is
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.120]   that the journey that you are on is deeply personal, right?
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.740]   It's shaped by your skills.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.020]   It's shaped by your experiences, your passions, right?
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.180]   It's the personal connection that you have
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.940]   to the missional expression which makes it so important.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.900]   It's the reason why living missionally in your neighborhood
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.740]   in the area that you do, your job that you have,
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.400]   while you attend this church,
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.180]   even the relationships that you have,
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.920]   they all become connections on what it means
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.040]   to love the person next to you, right?
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.280]   We have the opportunity to walk alongside of you
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.120]   in this area.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.700]   However, we certainly don't have all the answers
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.620]   on what it means to be living missionally.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.700]   And a significant reason for that
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.600]   is because there's a collective response involved, right?
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.140]   We come together as a community,
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.340]   as a community that we do like every Sunday
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.340]   in our community groups during the week,
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.500]   when you're in your workplace
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.020]   and you're having some of those sort of connections
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.940]   with other believers,
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.060]   that community is a part of what it means
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.860]   to be supporting, releasing,
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.060]   and encouraging us to live out our faith.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.540]   So my hope for you today is this.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.080]   Even though I don't know your context,
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.380]   I don't know the relationships that you're in,
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.060]   my hope is that this opportunity that we have right now
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.660]   could be a moment where God gives you the insight
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.340]   into who he's calling you to love.
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.660]   And that's what we're gonna do.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.980]   We're gonna create a space for this
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.580]   over the next few minutes,
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.380]   to take that step together as a community.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:52.260]   I've invited several people to come and pray over us today,
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.460]   people whose voices represent
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.660]   four different spheres of influence
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.020]   that we all interact.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.020]   Okay, I'm gonna ask you to bring up
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.920]   that four sections there on the slide.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.900]   Right, we're looking at places like the workplace.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.020]   So this is for people who are
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.020]   in an active employment form, right?
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.780]   An opportunity to find where you can express God,
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.540]   your faith in that particular space.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.660]   We have an area which we're gonna look at family, right?
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.860]   For either your family or a family
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.760]   that you're living with, a family that you care for.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.500]   We're gonna look at the next generation,
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.700]   the students and youth in our city.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.180]   And then also the Hong Kong community.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.100]   The broader sense of what it means
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.900]   to be living in this city and living missionally as well.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.520]   Right, we chose these areas
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.420]   because every one of us has an interaction
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.820]   with at least one of them, right?
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.120]   And I'm gonna give you 10 seconds right now
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.740]   just to look at these and to choose one
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.260]   that most closely resonates with you.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.380]   It doesn't have to be a sense of calling,
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.180]   but it is going to be a sphere
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.980]   where you're uniquely positioned
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.480]   to influence and live out the gospel.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:15.700]   Instead of having myself
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.980]   or one of our pastoral teams do this,
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.020]   we've actually invited a number of different people
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.460]   from our community to pray that prayer of encouragement
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.500]   and releasing over you as you go to interact
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.820]   with people across those communities.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.460]   And to me, that's important
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.060]   because this is the same people
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.980]   who bring the perspective that you carry, right?
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.060]   They're the people who have the same circumstances
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.020]   that you're involved with, the same opportunities.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.260]   So I'm gonna ask them to come and join me at the moment.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.580]   The first I'm gonna do is actually invite Tim to join us
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.100]   to pray over the workplace.
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.940]   And what we're gonna do, how this is gonna work is this.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.060]   If the workplace is an area which you feel called to,
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.620]   I'm gonna ask you to stand up, right?
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.140]   Tim is gonna pray over you.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.660]   But at the end of that prayer,
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.660]   as we go into the next sections, don't sit down yet, right?
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.820]   I want you to stay standing.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.620]   And as somebody stands up around you,
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.220]   I want you to turn to them and join us in prayer as well.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.940]   Join us in prayer and what it means
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.100]   to be living missionally,
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.140]   to be able to love the person next to us, okay?
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.340]   And while we're doing this, if God gives you something,
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.900]   if He gives you a person, if He gives you a people group,
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.820]   if He gives you an action that He wants you to do
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.940]   in response, I want you to feel the freedom
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.820]   to take out your phone, to take out your notepad,
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.620]   and just make note of one thing that you could be doing
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:36.740]   over the next week in response to that, okay?
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.580]   So for the people in that particular space with workplace,
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.340]   I'm gonna ask you to stand now
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.340]   and Tim's gonna pray for you.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.920]   (gentle music)
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:52.420]   - All right, let's pray.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.460]   Father God, as someone who spends a lot of time at work,
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.580]   I lift up all of the people who are standing here,
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.940]   who have always been busy with super packed schedules
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.580]   and taking a lot of responsibilities in their duties.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.860]   We sometimes focus fully on our work
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.700]   and forget about the purpose of life.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.340]   We may not spend enough time with our families and friends
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.380]   to manage our health, and the most important thing,
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.760]   we don't have enough time to spend with you.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.340]   God, I pray that you bring peace to our work
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.380]   and let you be the center of our lives.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.860]   I pray for your blessing to let us be a channel
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.760]   of God's peace in our workplace.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.420]   I pray for your courage and boldness
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.660]   to fill those stress, anxiety, and difficulties
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.420]   we are all facing at our work.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:47.360]   Help us not to be afraid, leading by examples on our fields
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.980]   in both of our performances
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.680]   and sharing great testimonies of your grace.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.900]   I pray that all of you are filled with God's love
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.380]   and presence at your workplace.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.140]   May you use all of us as a great tool
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.500]   to shine in between all of our coworkers,
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.340]   seniors, juniors, clients, and customers.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.380]   Thank you that you are the ultimate father in our workplace.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.700]   In your name we pray, amen.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.540]   - Thank you, Tim.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.940]   I'm gonna ask the people who feel like
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.620]   that sphere of influence that you wanna respond to
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.580]   is the family section, just to stand up now.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.340]   And we're gonna be joined by Melanie to pray over that.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:31.220]   - Heavenly Father, we lift up those fathers
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.960]   who are employed and spend a lot of time in the office.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.700]   Lord, we pray that you would help them
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.580]   and give them wisdom on how to balance their time
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.860]   between work and families,
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.180]   that they will trust you for their provision.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.260]   It is your will for families to grow in love
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.660]   toward one another, that you would enable them
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.660]   to be strong and courageous,
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.820]   no matter what circumstance themselves in.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:04.080]   Help them not to be afraid, but to stand in the fight
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.660]   and put their trust in you, God.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.020]   I bless you to be a safe place in your family,
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.980]   that you would walk in God's blessings and goodness,
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.700]   and that the glory of God shine upon you.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.780]   I bless you to be a channel of God's peace in Hong Kong.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.300]   I pray, Lord, for the release of your grace on them
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.100]   and in their families in a new measure
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.140]   from this day forward for your glory.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.480]   Father, we lift up all the moms
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.560]   who brought us up in your love and grace.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.240]   Give them wisdom and understanding
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.700]   in all the things they face,
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.120]   and that their hearts will be knitted together in love
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.220]   for their husband, children, and other family members.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:55.260]   Father, we pray for the children as well.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.340]   We declare that they belong to you,
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.360]   that they would fear you,
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.260]   place in their hearts a desire to love you,
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.380]   know you, and live for you, God.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.400]   Help every parent to train their children
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.980]   in the way they should go according to your word.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.120]   Thank you, God, that you are our ultimate father
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.660]   to all families.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.220]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.440]   - Thank you, Melanie.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.860]   I'm gonna ask Fran to come
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.200]   and a prayer over the Hong Kong community.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.660]   For people here in the city,
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.180]   you have an opportunity to respond to the needs
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.540]   that exist, would you please stand with us now?
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.000]   - Dear Lord Jesus,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.660]   as we reflect on missions and outreach today,
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.660]   we ask you to give us a passion for your great commission.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.380]   Open our spiritual eyes, Lord,
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.260]   to see the needs you see,
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.540]   to be your hands and feet,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.700]   your words, and your love to our family,
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.140]   our neighbors, our colleagues, our classmates,
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.600]   our friends, our street cleaners,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.700]   the cashier at the store,
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.540]   the stranger on the MTR, and more.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.580]   Give us compassionate hearts, Lord,
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.900]   and a love that comes from you,
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.120]   because our love is inadequate.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:24.780]   Empower and equip us with the gifts of your spirit, Lord,
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.780]   to reach out to every corner of Hong Kong
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.840]   and the rest of the world.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.980]   Give us a burden for those who do not yet know you,
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.700]   and give us courage and boldness to step out in faith,
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.980]   to share your love and salvation with them.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.860]   Speak to each one of us here today, Lord.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:53.340]   Open our eyes and hearts to a spiritual awareness
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.660]   of those who are in need of you.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:00.320]   Let us not be afraid of our inadequacies,
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.980]   because it is not our efforts or abilities.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.980]   Your promise to us is that as long as our hearts are willing,
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.040]   you will step alongside us to reap the harvest.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.420]   So place the desire in us, Lord.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.580]   Fan the flame within us, Lord,
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:23.300]   to rise up and be a worker in your field of harvest.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.580]   We proclaim that the workers will no longer be few,
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.860]   because we step forward and say,
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.660]   "Yes, Lord, here I am.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:38.660]   "Take me as I am, and use me in your field of harvest."
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.520]   Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.860]   We ask this in your name, amen.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.100]   - Amen.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:46.940]   Thank you.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.980]   And then lastly, the next generation.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.300]   I'm gonna invite my friend to come and just pray over that.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.900]   So if there's anyone who is seated,
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.480]   I imagine this is probably gonna be you.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.540]   Join us just to pray for the next generation
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.460]   here in the city.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:04.420]   - Heavenly Father, I lift up in prayer
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.500]   the young people whose spheres of influences
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.840]   are in schools like myself.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.780]   We known as students, we have a lot to learn,
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:19.460]   yet we can also be an example for others in speech,
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.020]   in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:28.260]   We seek your blessing to be the students
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.100]   you call us to be.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.320]   Jesus, our greatest teacher,
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.340]   would you teach us how to stand by our friends,
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:41.060]   our classmates, our teachers, our teammates,
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.980]   our sports coaches, our teachers,
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.180]   and our bus drivers.
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.880]   Holy Spirit, our closest helper,
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:00.740]   may you give us boldness in our positions as students.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.540]   When we need to extend ourselves to give,
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:09.540]   to care, to forgive, and to teach the people around us,
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.580]   grant us peace, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:18.620]   - Father, we thank you for the opportunity that we get
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.020]   just to be able to come together as a community,
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:25.180]   to be able to reflect on what it means to love you
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.820]   and to find our satisfaction in you,
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.180]   but at the same time to know that
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.140]   that is not all that you're calling us to do,
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.700]   calling us to love the person next to you.
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.500]   So that as we stand here today, Lord,
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.900]   I just pray that you would just bless and encourage
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.600]   each and every one of us in the responses that we take,
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.420]   and take the opportunity that we have to live our faith
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.220]   externally into society around us.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:52.620]   Lord, we thank you for that in your mighty name, amen.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.200]   (upbeat music)
