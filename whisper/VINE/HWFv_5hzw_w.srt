1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Hi. I have a question for you all. Who here, by show of hands please, who here watches Netflix?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Okay great. So my husband and I love a good show and as new parents we're not really able to watch as we used to.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 But when we get those little moments and we get the chance to just sit down and unwind, we really love a good British limited series.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Yeah, right. They're usually really short and they're jam-packed, cliffhangers, amazing storylines and they sort of leave you at the edge of your seat like,

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 "What's going to happen next? What's going to happen to this person?" But at the end of the series there's always a bit of a sigh and that's just it. It's over.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And now funnily enough there's a little series or a two-parter in the Bible and we've been looking at part one of it for the last few weeks.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 It's written by Luke. Both the Book of Luke and Acts are part of the same series and they're both about Jesus.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And trust me, it's more than your average Netflix show. Part one, the Book of Luke, as you may have noticed, speaks about the anticipation of the coming Christ,

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 his birth, his miracles, his death and his resurrection. And it's all from eyewitness accounts.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Part two in the Book of Acts is what happens after Jesus ascends into heaven, the Holy Spirit overtakes,

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 and how the Word of God, the Gospel, spreads from Jerusalem to the rest of the world.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And trust me, if you've read Acts, you know there's no shortage of extraordinary miracles and a show of the power of God.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Now, I mentioned Netflix earlier because there's often the temptation to look at the Bible the same way we look at a film or a series.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 It's entertaining whilst we're watching it, like in the moment, and maybe you talk about it a little bit afterwards, but it fades very, very quickly.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 It's like it fades into the box of memories of many, many other films that you've seen and that you've watched.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 So as we continue to look through Luke today, I want to challenge us not to do the same thing.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Let's not look at the Word of God like we do a film or a show on Netflix, where we're engaged in the moment and then we forget all about it as soon as we finish.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Where we don't apply what we've read into our own lives and we make the mistake of looking at the Bible as some sort of fictional story.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 The Word of God is true. The Word of God is life changing.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And it should be read with the expectation that every time we open it, God has something to say and he wants to meet with us.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 So have this in mind as we look at the text today.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 The Word of God is true. The Word of God changes lives.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 It always, always, always, always brings freedom and it goes far beyond us.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 It never returns to him void.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Last week, Chapman took us through Mary's song and today we're going to take a look at Zechariah's song.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I'm going to read a little bit before that so we get a better picture of what has happened and what brings him to actually sing.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 It's quite a long one, but I do think it's important to read the whole thing so then we can dive into it a little bit deeper.

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 So it's in Luke 1, verse 57 to 80.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And it reads, "When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy and they shared her joy.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child and they were going to name him after his father, Zechariah.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 But his mother spoke up and said, 'No, he is to be called John.'

33
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 They said to her, 'There is no one among your relatives who has that name.'

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Then they made signs to his father to find out what he would like to name the child.

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 He asked for a writing tablet and to everyone's astonishment, he wrote, 'His name is John.'

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Immediately, his mouth was opened and his tongue set free and he began to speak, praising God.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 All the neighbors were filled with awe and throughout the hill country and Judea, people were talking about all these things.

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Everyone who had heard this wondered about it, asking, 'What then is this child going to be?'

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 For the Lord's hand was with him."

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Verse 67, now we're getting into the song.

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 "His father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, 'Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 for he has come to his people and redeemed them.

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 as he said through his holy prophets long ago, 'Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,

46
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 the oath he swore to our father Abraham to rescue us from the hand of our enemies

47
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 and to enable us to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.

48
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High,

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 for you will go before the Lord to prepare the way for him,

50
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,

51
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 because of the tender mercy of our God by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven,

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death,

53
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 to guide our feet into the path of peace.'

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And the child grew and became strong in spirit,

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel. Amen."

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So, from this verses, it's really clear to see that God is at work.

57
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 A few weeks ago, we saw Mary's encounter with the angel,

58
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 we also saw Zechariah's, all within the same time period, not centuries apart.

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And we also saw how they both responded.

60
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Mary welcomed the word of the Lord, "I am your servant,"

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 while Zechariah doubted, "How can I be sure of this?"

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 His doubt actually echoes another story in the Old Testament.

63
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 It's quite similar to this one in terms of barrenness and waiting on the Lord.

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 We read in Genesis 18 that Sarah had a similar reaction

65
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 when she heard that she would have a child in her old age.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 In fact, she thought it was so ridiculous that she laughed.

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Now, can you imagine your grandma, actually your great grandma,

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 telling you she's pregnant, she's about to have a baby?

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 You would probably laugh and think it was a joke too.

70
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 But the Lord says to Abraham in verse 14, "Is anything too hard for the Lord?"

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Sarah was past childbearing age, and it really didn't seem like a feasible task.

72
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 But this was a reminder that if God says it, he can and he will do it.

73
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Nothing is impossible for God, which is the same message that we get here in Luke

74
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 and in many other parts of the Bible.

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 So this was said by the angel to Elizabeth, "For no word from God will ever fail."

76
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age,

77
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month.

78
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I'll say it again, "For no word from God will ever fail."

79
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And in the book of Isaiah, this is from the Lord himself.

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 "So is my word that goes out from my mouth.

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 and achieve the purpose for which I have sent it."

83
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Once he has spoken, we can be sure that he will fulfill it,

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 and ultimately, everything is fulfilled in the person of Jesus.

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Now, a few weeks back, we saw how Zechariah's mouth was actually muted.

86
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 He doubted the word of the Lord that was spoken to him by the angel,

87
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 and then he was unable to speak until after his son was born.

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 But even in his silence, he was able to declare that which God had already spoken.

89
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 As baby John was getting circumcised, eight days after his birth,

90
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 he was asked what the child's name was, and instead of what was common practice,

91
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 naming the child after a relative, he broke the mold and did something very different.

92
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 He chose in that moment to walk in obedience

93
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 and follow the instructions that were given to him by the angel.

94
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 And though he doubted at the beginning, he did, he also saw God's word come to pass.

95
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 He saw that, indeed, Elizabeth became pregnant.

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 He saw that she had given birth to their son,

97
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 and that their old age meant nothing because God had said it, and the miracle was done.

98
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Just as it was done for Abraham centuries before, God was doing it again.

99
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And now all eyes were on Zechariah.

100
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 What are you going to name this boy?

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And Zechariah decided to follow what the Lord had said.

102
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And as soon as he wrote down his name as John, it says,

103
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 "Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free,

104
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 and he began to speak, praising God."

105
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Now, declaring the word of the Lord brings freedom.

106
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 In Zechariah's case, it was freedom of his tongue and having the ability to speak again.

107
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 We also see God's word bringing freedom to the children of Israel in the book of Exodus.

108
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 The Israelites were slaves in Egypt and longed for their freedom.

109
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And as Moses continually spoke to Pharaoh, declaring God's words,

110
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 "Let my people go so they may worship me,"

111
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 the power of God broke through and the Israelites were set free.

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 When we speak God's word, his truth, into situations, there is always freedom,

113
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 whether it be physical freedom, spiritual, or freedom from sin.

114
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Now, if you're an old man, you've got no children,

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 you've been praying and waiting for decades,

116
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 probably going to the temple on a regular basis and just waiting on God.

117
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 We know that being childless was looked down upon because we see Elizabeth's words in verse 25.

118
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 "He has shown me favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."

119
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And it finally happens.

120
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 The Lord does this great thing.

121
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And after months of not being able to speak, what would be the first words out of your mouth?

122
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 I know for me, I might be a little bit sour at first.

123
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Not being able to speak for all that time throughout the pregnancy of our first child,

124
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 there must have been so many moments that he wanted to just exclaim,

125
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 you know, feeling that first kick, all sorts of things.

126
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Or maybe just so excited about this miracle that I'd be so obsessed with my baby,

127
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 which is often the case, and the prayers and the praise to God comes later.

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 But Zechariah doesn't speak about John.

129
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 He doesn't even speak about his wife, but immediately praises God.

130
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 And what follows is incredible.

131
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 His father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied.

132
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And to prophesy is to speak about things that are to come.

133
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So events that haven't happened, but certainly will in the future.

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 It's not fortune telling.

135
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 It's none of this weird new age stuff that you hear about today.

136
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 No tarot cards, no odd practices.

137
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It's nothing to do with our own strength.

138
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 It's always prophecies that come from God are always true,

139
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 and they always happen at their appointed time.

140
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And at this time, the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen on all men.

141
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 So there are moments throughout the Old Testament where you see people are overpowered,

142
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 empowered by the Holy Spirit to do something or to speak.

143
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 But we need to be aware that it isn't like what we experience today,

144
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 where we can lay hands on each other and ask for a filling of the Holy Spirit.

145
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 This was something that came much later.

146
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And there's a prophecy in Joel that speaks about these days,

147
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 the days that we are actually living in today.

148
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 What a privilege.

149
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 So what we read in Luke is actually an anticipation of what is to come.

150
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 It's little glimpses of the power of the Holy Spirit.

151
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 The angel said John would be filled with the Holy Spirit even before his birth.

152
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And we see that Elizabeth gets filled with the Holy Spirit in verse 41.

153
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And now Zechariah.

154
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 We know today that the filling of the Spirit often accompanies a great move of God.

155
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 In the book of Acts 2, after the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit,

156
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 they go out healing the sick, speaking in tongues, casting out demons,

157
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 and doing all sorts of things in the power of the Holy Spirit.

158
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And we have the ability to look back on these things.

159
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And as we put our faith in Jesus now, we can also be filled with the same Holy Spirit.

160
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 But here, Zechariah is looking ahead.

161
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 He's speaking of things that haven't actually happened.

162
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 He's speaking of things he had heard by word of mouth or by reading the scrolls.

163
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 So verses 68 to 65.

164
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Let's have a little look.

165
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them.

166
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 He's raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,

167
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 as he said through his holy prophets of long ago.

168
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,

169
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,

170
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 the oath he swore our father Abraham,

171
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 to rescue us from the hand of our enemies and to enable us to serve him without fear,

172
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days."

173
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Zechariah is pointing to the coming Christ in this prophecy.

174
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 He's sent to earth to redeem and save mankind, the most important event in our history.

175
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 That through the family of David, a revered king amongst the Israelites,

176
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 the ultimate King Jesus would come and fulfill the word of God.

177
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 That all the Old Testament prophecies, all the words that God spoke before,

178
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 through the prophets would come to pass.

179
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 So in case you missed it, this prophecy is all about Jesus.

180
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And we know that it is true because all of this has actually happened,

181
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 just as he said it would.

182
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Everything is about him.

183
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Zechariah realized that his own life, the birth of John, the surrounding events,

184
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 they were all part of a greater story.

185
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 By praising the Lord, he actively participated in the move of God

186
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 and what he was doing at that time.

187
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 He didn't look at his own life, nor did he focus on the birth of his son

188
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 or put that at the forefront.

189
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 All of that was secondary.

190
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 He knew that greater things were to come.

191
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 His humility opened him up to seeing that he was not the main character.

192
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And, surprise, surprise guys, neither are we.

193
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Even in our own lives, our stories are no longer about us.

194
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 The minute we become Christians, we often say we've given our lives to Christ.

195
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 He becomes the first and the last, and we surrender everything to him.

196
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 We give him the praise.

197
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 We give him the honor.

198
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Colossians 3 says we do everything as unto the Lord.

199
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 So that's your work life, the way you speak to each other, your family,

200
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 what we put in our bodies, everything is for him and about him.

201
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 We are no longer the main characters.

202
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Now, I'm going to take you back to our little Netflix example.

203
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 By show of hands, please, have a good look at these four guys.

204
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 I'm going to point to one, and I'm going to ask how many people recognize this person.

205
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 So I'm going to start with this guy.

206
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Show of hands, how many of you have ever seen this man?

207
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Okay.

208
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 This guy.

209
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Oh, yeah.

210
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 This guy.

211
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Maybe.

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 This guy.

213
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Yeah.

214
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 That was the response I was hoping for, guys.

215
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 That was the response I was hoping for.

216
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Now, you only recognize these two guys, this one here, this one.

217
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 A few, maybe like three people recognize this guy.

218
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 This guy, no one recognized this guy, which is great.

219
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 So you recognize these two the most because they are the main characters in their films.

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 They're the main actors.

221
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So the storylines are centered around them, their lives.

222
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 There might be some random love interest in there or something.

223
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 But for the most part, everything is about those guys.

224
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And it's interesting how they manage to keep us interested and invested in this character throughout the whole film.

225
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 The other two guys, you ask, never seen them before?

226
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Nope.

227
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 I had never seen them either until I started preparing for this sermon.

228
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And that's because they are actually stunt doubles.

229
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Yeah.

230
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 So a stunt double is a trained professional who stands in for an actor to perform dangerous or demanding tasks.

231
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 So obviously, you won't see the actual Daniel Craig jumping out of a helicopter or a building.

232
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 It will be a stunt double.

233
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 The two guys from the previous slides were their stunt doubles.

234
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 So those are the people that will be doing all the dangerous things.

235
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Yeah.

236
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 So the actor does the majority of the film with no regard for the stunt double.

237
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 All of the easy things, goes about his business.

238
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 But when he or she comes to that scene that requires a bit more strength, that's a bit dangerous, could cause a bit of harm or pain,

239
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 they just step aside, let the stunt double come and do it.

240
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And they do it to perfection.

241
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 But they're always in the background.

242
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 No one ever knows there was a stunt double.

243
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 It happens so quickly.

244
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And there's never a pause in the film that says, "This stunt was performed by a stunt double."

245
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Never, ever happens.

246
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And if you don't know much about films or you blink a bit too quickly, you may assume that it was the main actor who did it.

247
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 And all of the awards, all of the accolades, go to the main actor.

248
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 There is not an Oscar for stunt doubles.

249
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Surprise, surprise.

250
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 There should be, right?

251
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 But there isn't.

252
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Now, think about your own life for a second.

253
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 How many times have we been the main characters in our own stories and relegated God to our stunt double?

254
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 We call him when times are tough.

255
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 He comes in, he does the job, and then we push him to the background.

256
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 No praise, no honor, no recognition.

257
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 It's all about us.

258
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And as I was preparing for this sermon, I actually had to humble myself and repent because I realized that I was doing the exact same thing.

259
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I was in two minds about doing this sermon.

260
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And I had like a million questions.

261
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 I've narrowed them down.

262
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Should I?

263
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Shouldn't I?

264
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 All eyes on me.

265
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 I may not be able to just fade into the background after doing this.

266
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 I don't particularly like speaking in public.

267
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 What if I say the wrong thing?

268
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 I'm not a pastor.

269
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Should I be preaching?

270
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Now, let's look at those questions again.

271
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And I've made all of the I's and all of the me's bold.

272
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 So we can all count it together.

273
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

274
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Eight times.

275
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And trust me, I had way more questions.

276
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 There's way more I's and me's.

277
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Loads more.

278
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 So how many times did I talk about myself?

279
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Eight times.

280
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 How many times did I mention God?

281
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 How many times did I mention his will?

282
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 What he has to say?

283
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 I had made preaching and declaring his word all about me.

284
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And we often go about life in this exact same way.

285
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 We live for ourselves.

286
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 We wake up in the morning, it's about our kids, our spouses, our jobs, what we're going to eat, what we're going to wear, what will people think of us, where we need to be, what we need to do.

287
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 We often don't even consider what God has for us each day.

288
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And we go through the motions, doing life, going through the script, saying our lines, until we get to the crossroad where we need our trusted stunt double.

289
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And in preparing for this sermon, perhaps my mindset should have been this instead.

290
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 What does God want to share with his church?

291
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 How will he use me?

292
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 I'm going to read that again.

293
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 What does God want to share with his church?

294
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 How will God, how will he use me?

295
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 See, once you change your perspective and you shift your gaze to him, you realize that it isn't about you.

296
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 You are not the main character.

297
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 He is.

298
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And it is about what he wants to do in and through you.

299
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Now, Zachariah had the right idea.

300
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 He made God the center and had set his eyes on the things above.

301
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Luke 1 says he and Elizabeth were righteous in the sight of God, observing his commands blamelessly, and even after doubting, he was obedient and followed the word of the Lord, praising God and looking to him as the most important.

302
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 What he had just experienced was an afterthought.

303
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 When he looked ahead at what was to come, all of the prophecies of old were about to be seen in his day.

304
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And his son would prepare the way for the Messiah, the Christ, the Redeemer, the horn or the strength of salvation.

305
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 He would see scriptures that he had heard as a boy fulfilled.

306
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And only after he speaks about Christ does he mention John, his son.

307
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Jesus was always first.

308
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And when we believe in God and we believe in his words and we're obedient to him, we make him the main character.

309
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Just like Zachariah did. As we build our lives on him, we become, he becomes the center and we become a part of the big story that he is writing.

310
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Let's just take 10 seconds and just have a think about that last part.

311
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 As we build our lives on him, he becomes the center.

312
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 We become a big a part of the big story that he is writing.

313
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Can we just call up the worship team?

314
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 So I want us to have a think about our own lives.

315
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 How do we see Jesus?

316
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Is he the main character?

317
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Are we part of his great story?

318
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Or is he a tiny part of ours, like a stunt double?

319
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 So there's this worship song that I absolutely adore.

320
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And it goes like this.

321
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 I'm not going to sing, by the way.

322
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 No, I'm not going to break into song.

323
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 It seemed like a moment, right?

324
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 No, no, no.

325
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I'm going to read the words.

326
00:26:45,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 It says, turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in his wonderful face, and the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace.

327
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 I'm going to read it again.

328
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in his wonderful face, and the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace.

329
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 If we can all just close our eyes for a second.

330
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Lord, help us to fix our eyes on you.

331
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 To turn our eyes to you for all of our needs.

332
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 To look to you as our source of strength and peace, our guide, our help in times of trouble, but also in times of blessing.

333
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 That we will not forget that you are the main character.

334
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 That our lives are about you and bringing you glory.

335
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 And that when we start to look up to God, instead of looking ahead on earth, the things that aren't important to God really do fade away.

336
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Our fleshly desires, our pride, our selfish ways, and we start to love God more and love his people.

337
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 It's all about you, Lord.

338
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 In our finances, we ask that you would help to steward what you have given us.

339
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 In our homes, Lord, we would ask how we can honour you with our children, with our spouses and relatives.

340
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 In our workplaces, we would ask how we can glorify you in our behaviour towards our colleagues and our bosses.

341
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 In our serving, Lord, we would humble ourselves and see our giftings as a way to build up your church body and praise you.

342
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 On our commute to work, Lord, we would ask how can I show God's love?

343
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Giving up my seat, perhaps? Very rare.

344
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 There are so many areas of our lives that we need your help, God.

345
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 We don't want to be the main character, Lord.

346
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 That's your job.

347
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And Lord, help us to do it joyfully.

348
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Lord, there is joy in serving you.

349
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 There is joy in giving our lives to you, Lord.

350
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Let's just take a moment.

351
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 If anything is coming up, if God is pointing out anything that you may need to repent of, you can do that now.

352
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 (Piano music)

353
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Yeah, Lord, help us to just continue to live our lives for you.

354
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 It's all about you, Jesus.

355
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Thank you, Lord.

356
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 (Piano music)
