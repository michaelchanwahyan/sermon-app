[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220]   Welcome, Church, to this unusual Sunday where we find ourselves at home due to this T8 storm.
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.240]   My name is Justin, one of the pastors here at The Vine Church.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.480]   On this Sunday, we didn't think it was right for this T8 storm to hold us back from kicking
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.680]   off our brand new summer sermon series in the book of James.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.080]   As each of us are learning to navigate what it means to live faithfully to God while loving
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.920]   others in this season of Uncharted, the book of James has so much to teach us about what
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.000]   it means to love God, to love our neighbor, to love ourselves, with radical obedience,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.740]   but also with a radical faith that is tethered with practical daily wisdom that the book
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.600]   of James provides.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.840]   This morning, we have the privilege of hearing the first out of five messages in this sermon
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.680]   series from Pastor Phil.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.800]   This is actually also his first time he's preaching here at The Vine Church.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.120]   Before Pastor Phil gets here, I would like to pray for us.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.000]   So let us pray.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.480]   Father, we pray together this morning, no matter where we are listening in, tuning in,
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.520]   no matter whether there's a real storm raging outside or there are many storms raging within
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.720]   each of us, Father, I ask that you would give us the grace to be unhurried today, to be
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.840]   not distracted, but would you grant us the grace to be able to focus in what you have
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.840]   to say to us individually and as a community through Phil's word, through the word that
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.740]   you've given Phil.
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.840]   And so we just attend to you now.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.640]   And so would you speak to your church as we pray and as we worship this morning.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.120]   Jesus in your name we pray.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120]   Amen.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.960]   Hi, church.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   I'm so glad to be starting this five week summer series on the book of James today.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.600]   When Pastor Ellison sat down to design the summer series, he sensed God was really reminding
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.200]   him of the importance for radical faith and obedience in us to embrace the uncharted times
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.840]   we are in.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.240]   And with these recurring themes in mind, we can really rise to the challenge by going
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:33.640]   through James together, given its relevancy and strong challenge the book of James provide.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.320]   You might not have read James before.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.880]   You might have read plenty of James.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.560]   Or perhaps you are like me, who have dabbled here and there for golden verses in the wealth
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.400]   of James throughout your Christian life.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.000]   What is exciting, though, is that in these five weeks, we are all going to be doing it
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   together.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.360]   We'll be getting behind it, studying it in our CGs, teaching and preaching on it, applying
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.920]   it into our lives, and to have us looking forward to the series, let me present you
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.200]   with what we can expect to talk about in the coming five weeks.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:25.240]   Each week, we will cover a chapter of the book, and the listed topic are on the slide.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:32.200]   To give us some context before we begin, James is not easy to follow in the sense this circular
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.440]   letter he writes to his fellow Christian Jews is incredibly rapid fire.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.400]   James would make a punchy and wise one-liner of an instruction or a reminder, and then
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.200]   off he goes to another one-liner.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.280]   He doesn't really dwell to form a proper argument.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.160]   Doing a bit of research on James tells me that this book has the highest concentration
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.320]   of imperative verbs in the Bible.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.080]   Imperatives are command verbs, typically at the beginning of a sentence, and the 108
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:17.080]   verses there are in the five chapters of James, there are 61 imperatives in it.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:24.080]   James the book is a bossy book, the bossiest book you can say in the Bible.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.420]   But James the person isn't on caffeine pills.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.880]   He doesn't go over stimulant for no reason.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.600]   He wants the church to get practical, not just to land on or cherry pick a verse that
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.540]   is good to memorize on a bad day.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.240]   He wants us to come under and receive the implanted Word of God by being doers of the
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.720]   Word.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.780]   James chapter 1, verse 21 and 22.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.320]   So in other words, to accept the Word planted in us, to allow the Word to influence and
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.680]   form us in all parts of our lives as we take Jesus at his Word.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.480]   And so at every turn, when we see a new set of commands being prescribed in James, in
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.520]   each one of them, the serious reader has to ask the question, "Am I doing what it tells
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.600]   me to do?"
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.220]   Or rather, "Am I doing all that it tells me to do?"
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.380]   The title of today's message is "Pure Religion" and the phrase is found in the first chapter
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.340]   of James, verse 27.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.860]   Before we go there, I want to ask you what is it that comes to mind when you hear the
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:55.500]   word religion or the word religious, such as "So and so is religious."
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:04.820]   Do you feel excited or sceptical or proud or embarrassed by these words?
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:12.100]   My boy Cyril is in pre-nursery now and his K1 applications for kindergarten comes to
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.720]   mind when I think about the word religion.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.020]   In these applications, there's always three blanks to be filled about religion.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.540]   God's religion, mum's religion, and dad's religion.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.740]   I've seen a lot of these forms now and I'm constantly in disbelief of the bits of things
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.780]   they ask in the forms.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.620]   What do you mean by Cyril's religion?
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:44.300]   He has only recently turned three years old and the true and honest answer would probably
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:52.500]   be his toy cars if religion is about who or what we pursue in the greatest devotion.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:59.580]   There are toy cars in every room and on every furniture in our apartments, more than there
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.300]   are crosses in our home.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:12.300]   Yet to be filling in NA, not applicable for Protestant or Catholic school, it will probably
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:20.700]   be fatal given the competition and the score system around these interviews.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:27.820]   You see, considerations and assumptions are already going on in my head when I think about
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.060]   the word religion.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.500]   I'm thinking about the religion that Cyril identifies with.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:41.580]   I'm thinking about what others are going to think about Cyril's religion or mine religion
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.580]   or Christina's religion.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:54.540]   Let's turn to James chapter 1, verse 26 and 27 and I'm going to read it for us.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:00.260]   Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:06.140]   deceive themselves and their religion is worthless.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:13.100]   Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this, to look after orphans
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:21.380]   and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:31.420]   The Greek word for consider, those who consider themselves religious, that very word is doceio.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:38.260]   It gives the meaning to regard, to seem to others or to think of oneself and it carries
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:46.140]   the idea of something that appears a certain way either to others or to oneself.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:52.500]   And therefore notice as we read these verses we see James drawing a clear distinction between
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.280]   two types of religion.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:03.060]   In verse 26 James describes a human-centered religion, a religion that is perceived or
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.720]   regarded as valid by humankind.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:14.060]   In verse 27 James shifts our focus on the God-centered religion, a religion that is
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.740]   pure and faultless before the very eyes of God.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:25.460]   This is the kind of religion that our Father can accept because it is religion on his very
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.620]   terms.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.660]   Let's pause here for a moment and reflect on the word religion used in this passage.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:39.100]   It's an interesting word because it occurs quite rarely in the New Testament.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:47.300]   When it does it always refers to outward practices or ceremonies performed in honor of a God.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:53.660]   James doesn't seem to suggest there's anything wrong with religion, that is the religious
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.160]   or traditional rituals in themselves.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.540]   He doesn't dismiss the value of outward expressions of faith.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:09.620]   Instead what James takes issue with is rituals that go no further than outward show and empty
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.620]   words.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:20.340]   Religion like that, James says, is worthless or useless if we read other translations.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:26.500]   The concern here is that it is so easy to wear the label of a Christian without letting
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:37.580]   the life of Christ transform us, our action, our minds, our hearts, to call ourselves Christians
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:46.900]   and yet look a lot more of the world than of Jesus Christ who bids us to follow him.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:53.420]   Notice I say transform here because the Christian life is a journey and God's saving grace continues
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.140]   in every believer to make us more and more like Jesus.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:04.220]   We're not perfect, we're all getting there when we align ourselves to the trajectory
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:10.020]   of spiritual maturity which God intends and his grace enables.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:16.100]   But there is a problem when the pleasures of this world or the desire for approval really
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.900]   gets a hold of us.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:24.300]   Are we compromising our faith and rather than devoting every part of ourselves to God's
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:31.180]   delight and pleasure, we have somehow put him down somewhere in the pecking order.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.660]   One more thought before I move on.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:40.620]   I've explained the dichotomy between verse 26 and verse 27 and the contrast there may
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.160]   cause us to think in black and white manner.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.700]   That we are either superficial Christians or genuine Christians.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.900]   But that is problematic because realistically speaking that isn't the case.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:03.420]   Additionally this manner of thinking causes us to judge and shame and guilt ourselves
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.500]   and others.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:13.260]   Rather it is Holy Spirit who inspires us and convicts us.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.720]   So instead I've thought about how to modernise this bit of teaching here and I want you to
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:26.160]   think about the contemporary internet memes we see when we scroll our social media apps.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.080]   Think for a moment about those graphic memes we often see on social media.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.220]   You know, the ones with a split image.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:41.020]   The left side labelled one way and the right side labelled another to call us out.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:48.040]   I think if James was living in our age he would create a meme to drive us home.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:54.440]   On the left side he would say "Christianity on people's terms" and on the right side
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   he would caption "Christianity on Father God's terms".
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.900]   Do you see what Gen Z James is doing here?
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.460]   How would that meme look for you?
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.000]   What would be on each split of the image?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.560]   Would the split image on the right "Christianity that Father God accepts" mirror the split
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:24.020]   image on the left "Christianity that I see as valid"?
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:30.260]   James wants us to cross examine our Christian lives against the Christianity our Father
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.020]   God accepts.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:39.780]   Does the way we live match up with our claims of saying that we are Christian?
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:46.080]   And so as Holy Spirit convicts all of us Church, know that we don't close in the disparity
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.500]   by discarding or disregarding religion.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.060]   Religion is worthy.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.760]   Christianity is worthy.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:03.520]   It is pure religion when it's all about and only about having a relationship with God
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.820]   on his terms.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.900]   And what do we do then?
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:14.800]   Well we need to go and practice pure religion in the way James teaches us and so let us
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:22.380]   get back to the Word and take a look at the verses on pure religion again.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:28.780]   Here James suggests three specific marks of pure religion, that is controlling the tongue,
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:35.200]   concern for the helpless and the keeping oneself from being polluted by the world.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.440]   These three marks to some extent set the agenda for the rest of the letter and we are certainly
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.380]   going to return to these in more detail in the next sermons dealing with our tongue and
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.120]   our social responsibility.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:56.640]   For now I will very briefly extract the principle in these first two marks and spend the rest
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:03.860]   of the time on the third mark of pure religion, keeping oneself unstained by the world which
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:09.320]   precisely gives us the quality pure in pure religion.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.520]   That is our title for today.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:19.840]   So the first principle we can extract is this, having total control over the self.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:26.060]   Self-control is so important especially in the times we live where everywhere we look
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:31.440]   there seems to be a real decline in discipline and in restraint.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.240]   The organ that is easiest to let loose is our tongue which is why James mentioned the
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:44.440]   controlling of the tongue but in reality we are talking about self-control in every department
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.160]   in us.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.800]   Pure religion is self-control.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:58.380]   The second principle we can extract from the second mark, looking after orphans and widows
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.440]   in their distress, is compassion.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.520]   Pure religion is to be compassionate.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:11.680]   Hearing this mark we might automatically be led to think about who the modern day distressed
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.560]   orphans and widows are.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.800]   Maybe the homeless, the trafficked, the abused and yet the numbers we have for orphans and
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.840]   widows are already staggering.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:31.600]   The 2023 statistics tells us that the number of children living in institutional care is
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:40.800]   4,000 and the number of female over the ages of 65 that are widowed, divorced or separated
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.520]   is 358,800.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:51.800]   This principle stresses that our religion is not a passive one, not one that we can
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:58.120]   claim to be Christian as long as we are not actively breaking commandments that displease
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.760]   us God.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.520]   Christianity that remains at goodwill, remains at being nice and empathic towards others
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:14.360]   without crossing over to gut-wrenching compassionate care for others isn't Christianity because
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   it doesn't resemble the incarnate Christ at all.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   We are going to the third principle and we're going to spend some time here considering
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.600]   what it means to be pure.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.120]   Keeping ourselves unstained by the world.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.880]   Essentially they are the same quality, being pure and being unstained.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   The Greek for pure is katharos and it translates to clean or free.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.880]   It's used as a qualifier to talk about the state of the heart.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:57.120]   Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see the Lord, Jesus says.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:04.320]   And so purity is really about a single-minded heart unto God while we are in this world.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:13.640]   We can be lawyers, bankers, salespeople, homemakers, teachers and we are said to be pure when we
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:21.520]   go about our roles in such God-consciousness, we make sure we are the ones carrying a Christ-like
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:28.400]   influence into the world rather than the other way round, having the world bring its influence
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.760]   on us.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:37.600]   Because the world, the word that we find in this passage, the word we are told to be unstained
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.560]   from refers to the world system ruled by God's enemy.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.240]   Theologian Douglas Moo explains it like this.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:54.440]   The world is a common biblical way of referring to the ungodly worldview and lifestyle that
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:00.240]   characterize human life in an estrangement from the Creator.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.720]   It is the system of order contrary to the heavenly order.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:11.280]   Christians who have ended that estrangement by accepting the reconciling work of God in
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:23.080]   Christ must constantly work to keep themselves spotless from the world's contaminating influence.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:30.920]   I want you to recall your own story, the time you became a Christian or the time you started
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.200]   to take faith seriously.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:42.800]   We didn't set out to become a Christian with the aim to have it on our own terms.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:52.040]   Nobody sets out to follow Jesus with the aim to also have one foot in the world until life
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.160]   gets brutal.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   And so James had in mind the dire circumstances of his contemporary Christian Jews when he
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:08.640]   wrote the letter, Jews who had received the gospel, converted over to Christianity and
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.280]   living outside of Israel.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.880]   Many of them were in poverty, in sickness.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:22.040]   Many were facing persecution, financial oppression and social marginalization because of their
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.420]   faith.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:28.320]   Many of them could be better off in the world's terms if they would look a little bit more
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.200]   like the world.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:37.600]   You see, persecution is the clash between two irreconcilable value systems.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:44.040]   I am borrowing this quote of Andrew Sermon in March, titled Persecution.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:51.720]   It's fantastic to revisit and it was from March this year.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:58.640]   Only until we have become Christians, we realize the full force of the world acting against
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.000]   our commitment to follow Jesus.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.720]   Only until we have become Christians that the burdens and pressures, that the trials
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.880]   and temptations seem to rack up.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:19.760]   And that is because by being in Christ, we have become aliens and social outcasts to
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.840]   this world.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:27.720]   And that is why in harsh circumstances, we are very vulnerable to the delusion that it
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:35.080]   is okay to put our needs, whether emotional or physical, back to the forefront in the
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.880]   very place only God used to be.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:46.240]   That it is okay to be friends with the world and friends with God at the same time.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:53.960]   We want to believe such place exists, where we will always be considered by God and consoled
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:22:01.240]   by God regardless of our actions, where we can enjoy the thrill of feeling right and
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:07.160]   need not necessarily endure the inconvenience of being right.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:15.320]   I want to say this again, where we can enjoy the thrill of feeling right and need not necessarily
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:20.200]   endure the inconvenience of being right.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:26.500]   That somehow our religious performances and services and church attendance would make
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.880]   us feel worthy again.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:36.620]   Beloved brothers and sisters, do not be deceived.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.920]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:47.880]   Three times in this chapter, James notions the Christian Jews not to fall for a lie.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:54.840]   Seeing the fragility of these Christian Jews and their susceptibility to fall for the world
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:02.280]   again, he pled them not to fall for the impression that they could be happy having one foot in
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.520]   God and the other in the world.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.280]   The bubble must be burst.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:15.160]   This sometimes feel good human-centred religion in Christianity doesn't deliver and has to
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.400]   go.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:25.720]   Church, this living and active word in James is still very relevant in us.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.120]   We also perhaps need to have our bubbles burst.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.840]   To remember that there are no shortcuts to Christian living, to remember that God's
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:42.640]   purposes are always greater than our own, that ultimate joy and freedom comes from living
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.180]   fully for him.
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.880]   So what shall we do then?
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.840]   We've covered some theological ground today.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.760]   We've encountered the word.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.360]   We've heard bits of relatable things here and there.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:01.040]   And we now need to think about how to put this into practice.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.400]   Are we ready?
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:10.760]   Let us work our way for some application for all of us to take home this week.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:17.420]   First of all, I want all of us to read the first chapter of James for this week.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.840]   Whether it is with your CG or on your own, to read it through and to really appreciate
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:30.060]   the thought of James, because we have only really looked at the last two verses in chapter
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.540]   one today.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:38.420]   And yet the whole chapter, the whole of mind, the whole mind of James until this point,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.760]   he was building up to these two verses.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:51.540]   So application one, everybody let's read the chapter of James, the first chapter of James.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:57.980]   Okay, second application, reflect and write down a few things that cause you to compromise
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.660]   your faith.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:05.020]   So when James wrote his greeting for the letter, he addressed himself as slave of God and of
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.020]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:12.760]   You might have seen this type of self-identification used elsewhere in the New Testament letters
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.700]   before with Paul or with Peter.
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:21.700]   And provocatively identifying themselves as slave, the New Testament writers wanted their
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:29.040]   Christian readers to also follow suit, to own the identity for themselves.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:36.760]   For James, the very brother of Jesus, he preferred identifying himself as slave over than brother
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.760]   to Jesus.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:44.020]   For him, the emphasis was to encourage his readers that it is the daily taking on the
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:51.500]   role of slave that leads Christians to ultimate freedom from the pleasures and hardships
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.540]   and temptations of this life.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:26:00.560]   And so when we are to reflect and write the things that compromise our faith, what we're
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:07.580]   doing is we're exposing and owning up to God the things that we are attached to or that
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.180]   we are enslaved or that we are vulnerable to.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:18.620]   And in this regard, we're saying, God, we desire to assume the role of a slave to Christ
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:23.140]   and not to anything else.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:28.060]   Application three, to pray and ask for wisdom.
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:33.900]   We come to this final application point and it is to ask for wisdom from our generous
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.060]   father.
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:41.420]   James promises us that when we ask God of wisdom, he will give it to us.
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.580]   This type of wisdom isn't like knowledge or experience.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.060]   It isn't about the book smarts or the street smarts.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:54.980]   And while these things are super important in life, when we face tough times, we especially
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.420]   need wisdom.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:02.660]   Wisdom is godly perception to help us know what's going on or what's happening to me
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.860]   during tough times.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:10.180]   Wisdom tells us the right reactions to have during these times.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:16.760]   Wisdom doesn't cause us to be rich or clever, but it causes us to be fit for purposes that
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.100]   God wills us.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:23.020]   That's what we're doing when we are asking for God's wisdom.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:28.900]   It is saying, "Lord, I want your wisdom to see what you think about this, to see from
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.700]   your point of view."
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:36.340]   And without wisdom, we would always think conforming and compromising to the world's
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.100]   standards are good trade-offs.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:46.180]   And that's why throughout the whole chapter, we have James carrying out a reversal of the
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:52.700]   world's opinion, giving us commands that are upside down in the world's standards and
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.500]   yet the right way up.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:03.340]   For example, the world tells us that it is okay to cuss and grumble when we face trials.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:10.020]   James 1.2, consider it pure joy when we face trials.
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:15.220]   The world tells us that we are in a secure position and we have a house and a car and
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.260]   a good paying job.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:23.140]   James 1.9, believers who are poor have something to boast about.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:31.380]   So in other words, in God's opinion, the rich aren't better off than the poor.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.620]   The world tells us God is to blame for our temptation.
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:44.700]   James 1.12, God blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptations.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.700]   The world tells us that it is important to fight for our rights.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:55.500]   James 1.19, be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to get fired up.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:01.540]   And so the final application here we have to ask God for wisdom.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:10.020]   Okay, just to quickly summarize, the first application to read the whole chapter of James.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:16.860]   The second application to ask God and to write down the things that we compromise in our
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.260]   faith.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:29.060]   And finally, to ask God for wisdom, to ask God for his opinion on every matter in life.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:35.140]   As I draw to a close, I want to bring up a quote that has encouraged me greatly in my
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.920]   sermon prep.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:43.980]   This quote afforded me the boldness to represent God here, encouraging us not to worry with
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:52.780]   persecution, to not worry with nominal Christians, to not worry about being visible in this religion,
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:58.100]   but to endure and to take him at his word.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:04.220]   One of the greatest paradoxes in Christian history is that the church is most pure in
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:10.020]   times of cultural hostility, when things are easy and good.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.940]   That is when the church most often goes astray.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:19.380]   When Christianity seems identical with the culture and even when the church seems to
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:26.140]   be enjoying its greatest earthly success, then it is weakest.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:34.420]   Conversely, when the church encounters hardship, persecution and suffering, then it is closest
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.380]   to its crucified Lord.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:43.300]   Then there are fewer hypocrites and nominal believers amongst its members.
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:50.700]   And then the faith of Christians burns most intensely.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.700]   Let us pray, church.
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:59.800]   Father, what we are after is a faith that burns intensely.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:06.660]   We know for a fact that we are closest to your Son, our crucified Lord, when we endure
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.620]   and take him at his word.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.260]   In his words, he intends us to obey.
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:19.940]   They are not unattainable ideals because we have your Holy Spirit leading us.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:27.540]   In this world where you have put us in, help us to have such purity and single-mindedness
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:32.420]   to endure as we can physically see you.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:40.820]   Grant us wisdom and boldness to practice religion that is pure and acceptable in your sights.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.700]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.700]   Amen.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.700]   Amen.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.700]   Amen.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.700]   Amen.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.700]   Amen.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.700]   Amen.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.700]   Amen.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.700]   Amen.
