[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   In Genesis 3, when Adam and Eve take that fruit
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   that they were told not to eat and they ate it.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.760]   Scripture says that their eyes were opened
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.200]   and they realized that they were naked
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.300]   and they were ashamed.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.720]   And then you fast forward in Scripture many, many years
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.120]   to the death and resurrection of Jesus
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.460]   and those two disciples walking on the road
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.460]   after the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.160]   And they're talking about what's just happened in Jerusalem
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.960]   trying to get their heads around it.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.920]   Scriptures say that Jesus comes alongside of them
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.720]   and has that conversation with them.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.480]   And then they sit down at the end of the day
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.000]   with this stranger, they don't know who he truly is.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.560]   And he brings them around the communion table,
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.400]   what we've just shared together as a fellowship.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.160]   And as they break bread and they share the cup,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.880]   the Bible says that these two disciples,
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.280]   their eyes were opened and they were able to see Jesus
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.520]   for who he truly was.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.040]   And there's this beautiful sort of balance in Scripture
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.680]   between sin opening our eyes to horror and terror
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.840]   and darkness and chaos.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.960]   And yet Jesus' sacrifice, his death and resurrection
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.360]   opening our eyes to his glory, to who he truly is.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.480]   We now get to stand on that side of the resurrection
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.560]   and I wanna encourage you in this room
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.640]   that we've just been singing that song,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.960]   Dead Things to Life.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.120]   And I feel like some of us as we're singing that song,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.240]   our eyes were closed to the beauty
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.560]   that God has put all around us.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.600]   That our eyes are perhaps closed at this time
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.240]   to the hope that there is in a situation
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.360]   that you're struggling with.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.680]   Sometimes the enemy will close our eyes,
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.040]   keep us blind from the goodness of God.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.840]   This is why so many times in Scripture,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.600]   a person of God has to declare,
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.560]   I will see the goodness of God in the land of the living.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.800]   I wanna speak out over you
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.560]   that no matter how dark it might seem for you at times,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.360]   that there is hope, that Jesus is here present.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.880]   And sometimes we need our eyes open to see him.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.720]   We get to celebrate in just a few moments,
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.840]   21 people getting baptized down in Repulse Bay Beach
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.720]   as a symbol really of their eyes being open
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.280]   to seeing Jesus more fully.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.440]   And I wonder whether you just in this moment
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.120]   want your eyes to be opened again,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.520]   to see him for who he truly is in your life
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.760]   and all the things that are happening.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.680]   So I wonder whether you just open your hands with me
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.960]   as I pray for us.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.360]   Father, I pray for each person in this room.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.640]   Lord, the eyes of our hearts, Lord,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200]   can be often shut to the work of your glory
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   and goodness and beauty in our lives.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.800]   (gentle music)
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.880]   And Lord, we know that you paid that price on the cross,
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.000]   rose again so that we would know forgiveness
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.240]   and grace and mercy and new life.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.520]   So just like those two disciples around that table,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.480]   our eyes would be open and we could see you,
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.000]   see the hope that there is in you,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.280]   see the life that comes in you,
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   see the forgiveness and experience that
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.760]   that comes from your mercy and your grace,
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.680]   like those who are getting baptized today
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.160]   are testifying too.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.720]   And Lord, I pray for each person here
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.360]   who's going through a dark time,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.760]   where struggle or suffering or strife or tiredness
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   or just whatever it is, it's just overwhelming.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.920]   Lord, I wanna pray for the opening of eyes today.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.640]   Lord, you don't guarantee that you're gonna pull us
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.040]   magically out of all of the bad stuff,
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.920]   but you do help us to lift our eyes up to see you,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.880]   to know where our help comes from.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.760]   You come and walk beside us as we go through
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.440]   the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.680]   You take our hands and you show us what you've placed
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.200]   in them for your glory in this time.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   So Lord, for whoever it might be in this room,
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.440]   wherever they might be that they're struggling or in need,
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.080]   would you open their eyes, Holy Spirit, now
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.680]   to your presence and your goodness,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.320]   to your faithfulness, Lord.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.560]   And we declare as a church, as the psalmist would,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.520]   that we will see the goodness of the Lord
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.200]   in the land of the living,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.120]   that in this place, in all of its faults,
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.400]   in all of its struggles, in Hong Kong,
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.920]   in this time, in this hour, just like Jethro led us to pray,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.240]   we will see the goodness of God in this city.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.320]   Lord, I open our eyes to the majestic things
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.720]   that you're doing.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.320]   And then they call us to partner with you in those things
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.120]   so that they would be for your name,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.120]   your fame and your glory.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.360]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.320]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.440]   We put our hands together for our worship team.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.080]   So grateful for them.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.320]   Welcome to the Vine, have a seat.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.960]   Welcome, welcome, if you're here for the first time,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   we're so glad you are here.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.920]   If you're joining us because maybe a friend
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.400]   or a family member is getting baptized,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.080]   we're also so glad you're with us today.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.480]   My name is Andrew.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.320]   All right, how we doing?
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.160]   There you go.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.000]   My name is Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.100]   and it's great.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.700]   We're in week two of a short two-week series
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.080]   on the biblical vision of beauty.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.360]   And we started off last week really trying to unpack
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.000]   the theological foundations of beauty.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.360]   And we talked about last week
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.800]   how there's this interesting phenomenon
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.360]   where beauty and suffering so often go together.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.020]   We talked last week about the reality
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.920]   that we often wanna bring flowers to a funeral,
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.520]   or we wanna write a beautiful get well card
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.260]   to someone who's in the hospital.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260]   We have this innate desire in us to partner beauty
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.120]   and suffering alongside of each other.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.160]   And I gave us a provocative question last week.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.620]   I said, if that's the case,
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.320]   then could it be actually that beauty could save the world?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.520]   And we said last week that, well,
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.080]   perhaps not the beauty that we normally think of
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.060]   when we hear the word beauty.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.200]   You know, the subjective, aesthetic,
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.960]   eye of the beholder kind of beauty,
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.920]   the sort of beauty where everybody has an opinion
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.760]   as to whether something is beautiful or ugly.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.920]   And when you look at beauty in that way,
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.760]   you might be forgiven for thinking like,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.880]   how can there be any hope in that kind of flimsy beauty?
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.440]   That there can't be surely any way
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.840]   that that type of beauty could impact suffering.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.480]   And so I challenged this last week
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.760]   that perhaps the way we define beauty is wrong.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.040]   Perhaps the way that the world considers and looks at beauty
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.000]   is actually not the way that the scriptures speak
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.820]   of what beauty truly is.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.680]   And so we went on a little journey last week
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.200]   of opening up the Old Testament and the New Testament
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.920]   for this concept of beauty.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.560]   And we saw that beauty has actually a lot less
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.640]   to do with aesthetic subjectiveness
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.200]   and much more to do with objective goodness.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.920]   That beauty as scripture defines it
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.280]   is about splendor and majesty and wonder and mystery.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.420]   And ultimately always pointing us
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.360]   towards the concept of glory.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.660]   That beauty speaks of the reality
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.400]   that there is a divine objective goodness in the world
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.720]   that's been woven into the fabric of creation.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.040]   And we can know that kind of beauty
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.340]   and that beauty can set us free.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.840]   We looked at the reality of that beauty,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.440]   didn't we last week in Genesis one and two.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.840]   And we said that we see this beautiful picture
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.160]   right at the beginning of scripture
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.140]   on what beauty is all about.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:51.140]   We saw a formless, dark and shapeless world
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.560]   but the Holy Spirit hovering over it,
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.000]   waiting to bring it into life.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.360]   And then as God speaks, let there be life,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.160]   we see that God in his creative goodness
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.160]   creates the world, brings order out of that place of chaos.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.720]   And at the end of every day of that creativeness
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.680]   of taking something that is chaotic
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.360]   and bringing it into a place of order,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.860]   God stands back and says, this is good.
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.540]   The actual Hebrew word there is the same word for beauty.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.960]   This is beautiful.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.200]   It's beautiful because what was chaotic
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.760]   now has order and structure and shalom and peace to it.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.480]   And we saw last week that the culmination
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.840]   of that creation is humanity made in God's image.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.720]   In other words, we are made beautiful in him
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.920]   so that we can then partner with God
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.220]   in the outworking of beauty in the world.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.580]   But we see what happens in Genesis three,
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.000]   where humanity through its choice to sin in that moment
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.480]   takes the world back into a place of chaos.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.680]   And the rest of scripture really is the big question
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.000]   of can we ever know and encounter beauty again?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.340]   Like would order ever come to the chaos that sits in us?
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.120]   We said last week that of course Jesus is that answer,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.960]   isn't he?
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.320]   His life, his death, his resurrection.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.040]   He's the one who comes to create that order in us again.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.920]   And as we see the work of the cross
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.980]   and the way that Christ sheds his blood
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.540]   so we would know redemption of our sin,
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.300]   so that we would come into a place of order again with him,
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.980]   forgiveness and mercy and grace
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.220]   so that we can live a new creation as Paul speaks of it.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.480]   As we see that journey,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.700]   we get to understand the power of the glory of God.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.660]   And we receive then the calling on us as his people
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:42.060]   to be those people that can walk out that glory
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.060]   in the world around us.
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.940]   So I said to us last week that the definition,
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.980]   a biblical definition of beauty is this,
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.340]   that beauty is the objective creative work of God
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.700]   to bring order out of chaos.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.500]   Making sense, still with me?
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.740]   That that is the journey that God is in in our lives.
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.300]   That's what he's done in each one of us.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.900]   And so I can stand before you today
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.100]   looking at every single one of you in this room and online,
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.820]   and I can say you are beautiful.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.620]   I mean, you really are beautiful.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.060]   And I can give you two biblical reasons why
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.900]   when you woke up this morning and looked in that mirror,
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.400]   you don't see ugliness, but you should see beauty.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.900]   Because you are one that God has taken by his spirit
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.220]   and has begun to rejuvenate by the work of his power
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.120]   and his mercy in your life.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.980]   You are one who was chaotic in your sin
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.860]   and now is walking in a place of sanctification.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.980]   It's just a biblical word.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.820]   That means we're going from one aspect of glory
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.340]   to the next, becoming more and more like his son, Jesus.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.980]   Ephesians 4 welcomes us, doesn't it,
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.380]   into this beautiful invitation that we would know
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.900]   the wholeness of the wholeness of Christ.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.500]   And so you are beautiful because the spirit of God
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.460]   is at work in your chaos,
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.300]   bringing you into a place of order.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.860]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.380]   But you're also beautiful because God has called you
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.340]   not just to be one who receives the work of beauty
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.060]   in your life, but one who actually then commits yourself
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.300]   to living out acts of beauty in the world.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.540]   In other words, you're not just saved
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.540]   so you would know order.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.260]   You're called by God as a human being
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.660]   to now be one who goes into the world
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.340]   and brings the offer and the hope of that order
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.900]   for them themselves.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.340]   And there are 21 people getting baptized today
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.020]   who can testify that somebody somewhere in their life
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.460]   has shared the good hope of Jesus with them
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.260]   and they're moving into the waters.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.740]   We go down into the waters of baptism
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.020]   to say that we go down into that darkness
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.620]   that we used to have and we come up out of it
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.260]   washed clean by the hope of Jesus.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.340]   That, my friends, is beauty.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.100]   And we come out of it clean,
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.160]   not so that we can just get our ticket to heaven
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.620]   and be more holy people.
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.020]   We come out of it now with a mandate
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.700]   that we ourselves are called to go into the world
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.140]   with evangelism and mission and hope
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:13.780]   to share the good beautifulness of God in our lives
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.740]   with everyone around us.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.780]   That's the journey of the Christian life.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.360]   So let me say this to you,
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.460]   and it's really important you hear this.
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.460]   Christians should be curators of beauty.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.340]   I mean, we are the ones who go into the world
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.180]   and announce what is beautiful
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.980]   by partnering with the Holy Spirit
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.980]   to do acts that bring goodness and peace and shalom
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.060]   to all of the chaos around us.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.060]   That's what we've been invited into, friends.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.540]   That call came right at the beginning in Genesis 2
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.500]   where he said, "I want you to go and steward
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.120]   "all of creation.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.600]   "You can see what's beautiful around you.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.540]   "Now go and be my beauty in the world."
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.300]   And that same calling now sits on us today
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.960]   that we get to move into the world
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.960]   offering the hope of Jesus, doing acts of beauty,
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.940]   speaking life where there is chaos,
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.920]   bringing light where there is darkness,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.900]   participating with the hope of God.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.420]   Now that's really good news.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.600]   That's really good news right now for the city of Hong Kong.
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.860]   A theologian once put this whole work of beauty like this.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.780]   He says, "God gave us grain and grapes,
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.140]   "and in return we give him bread and wine."
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.180]   There's a participation with the Holy Spirit
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.900]   in taking the things that God has done in our lives
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.380]   and creating something that can show the world
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.820]   the beauty and the glory of God.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.780]   And I think if that's true,
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.700]   then us Christians need to lean in
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.460]   perhaps more than anyone else
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.780]   to the creative impulses that are placed in us.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.100]   That those creative impulses
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.820]   that cause us to want to create something,
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.460]   do something, say something, help somebody,
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.100]   pause for a moment in our offices,
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.940]   walk with someone, listen to them,
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.060]   look at the things that are happening around us
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.100]   and try to bring some goodness and peace
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.300]   and shalom into the world.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.140]   Why?
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.240]   Because to do so is a sacramental act, much like communion.
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.060]   To partner with the Holy Spirit
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.540]   to see more hope and joy and peace and life
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.340]   come into the world is sacramental.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.780]   It's taking something that is an earthy action
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.860]   and partnering with the divine objective goodness of God
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.380]   to create something that was not there before.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.900]   And when we do that, we are bringing beauty into the world.
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.940]   And here's your mandate.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.100]   Here's what it means for you to be alive in Hong Kong
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.220]   in 2021.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.900]   And you are gifted in so many ways,
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.740]   but your primary goal
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.120]   is to be a creator of beauty in the world.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.460]   And some of you are sitting there thinking,
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.780]   I'm not very creative.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.860]   Like, I don't know, I'm not really very creative at all.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.340]   Remember what we said last week,
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.360]   untangling a child's knotted hair with a hairbrush
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.500]   is taking chaos and bringing in the order.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.780]   Being willing to sit with someone
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.940]   that you're broken in relationship with
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.660]   and doing your best to reconcile that relationship with them
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.320]   is bringing beauty into the world.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.640]   In many small and large ways,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.980]   we get to contribute creatively with the Holy Spirit
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.980]   to see this world change and grow.
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.980]   And if all of this is true, guess what?
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.980]   The church is the best positioned organization
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.960]   and family and community in the world
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.940]   to be able to bring beauty,
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.660]   the healing balm of beauty to a broken community.
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.620]   I mean, there is nothing else in this world
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.540]   that is better primed and ready
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.340]   to administrate the healing beauty
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.300]   of God's love to the world.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.900]   I mean, take a look at this moment right here,
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.800]   right now in this room.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.220]   I mean, we have this space, don't we, which is such a gift.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.940]   We have art all around us.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.900]   Have a look at the posters that are in the stairwell
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.020]   on the way out.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.380]   We have music that's created to enable us to worship.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.100]   We have conversation and sharing.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.740]   We have community with one another.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.760]   All of those things can testify to the beauty of God
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.800]   and the Spirit's transformative work in us.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.420]   But when I say that the church is most primed
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.820]   to bring the healing balm of beauty into the world,
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.820]   I'm not actually just talking about the 90 minutes
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.800]   of us gathering here on a Sunday.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.660]   What I'm actually talking about is you,
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.380]   the incredible people that are sitting here
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.940]   and watching online right now,
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.860]   that each one of you is a gift of God's beauty.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.300]   You are carrying in you a testimony
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.900]   of what the Holy Spirit has done in your life.
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.980]   And each one of you has gifts and talents and callings
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.020]   and are placed in spheres of influence.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.060]   And if there is anyone who has ever been primed
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.800]   to make a difference in the world, surely it is us.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.640]   We saw last week in Isaiah 61, verse three,
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.400]   that right at the end of that passage is a challenge.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.280]   God says, "I'm gonna replace your ashes for beauty.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.840]   "I'm gonna put beauty on you instead of ashes."
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.680]   Why?
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.740]   "So that you would be a planting of the Lord
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.200]   "for the display of His splendor."
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.640]   I want you to think about this.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.160]   A planting of the Lord for a display of His splendor.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.280]   Both of these things are important.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.460]   If you are a Christian, you are a planting of the Lord.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.320]   That God has done a transformative work in you.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.480]   Paul would say, "Your old is gone, your new has come.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.500]   "You've come out of the waters of baptism,
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.960]   "sanctified in Him.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.680]   "You have new hope, new life.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.620]   "The Spirit has regenerated you,
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.160]   "and you're walking now in glory to glory."
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.680]   That's the wonder of being a planting of the Lord.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.940]   "But you're not just that," the writer of Isaiah says.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.960]   "You're also that in order to display the glory of God."
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.660]   In other words, if all you do is get yourself saved
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.460]   and then hide in a little Christian bubble,
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.220]   then you're not actually the fullness
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.500]   of what God has called you to be.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.660]   You are also not just a planting of the Lord,
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.620]   but to be displaying His glory to the world.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.740]   A display of His glory.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.420]   In other words, there's gotta be something you're doing
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.380]   or saying or acting or being
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.860]   that shows the sphere of influence around you
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.280]   that Christ has made a difference in your life.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.740]   That's the wonder of what it is
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.700]   to call yourself a Christian,
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.280]   to hold the name of Christ in you.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.700]   And this is such a gift.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.140]   The early church was really passionate
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.700]   about Christians' understanding
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.020]   that they get to display the beauty,
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.480]   the glory of God to those around them.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.900]   See, if evangelism and missions
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.980]   is about the glorification of God,
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.860]   about telling the world of God's glory,
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.680]   then we are never more beautiful
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.480]   than when we're actually outworking mission
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.160]   and evangelism in and through our lives.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.120]   That's when we're most beautiful,
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.520]   when we're actually pointing people towards hope,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.360]   pointing people towards the glory
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.240]   that God has placed in their lives.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.840]   And this is what the early church writers
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.280]   were all focused on,
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.620]   wanting the church to know they're a planting of the Lord,
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.480]   but also a display of God's glory.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.940]   Because if they didn't display His glory,
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.080]   how could the world know that there is hope?
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.060]   And could the greatest call
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.340]   in the church in Hong Kong right now
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.180]   be the need for us to be a display of the glory of God,
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.820]   because the world and this city
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.200]   desperately needs to find fresh hope?
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.740]   I wanna show you how Peter actually positions
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.180]   the call of the church into acts of beauty,
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.900]   in being the very people that Christ has saved them to be.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.560]   This is Peter writing to the church.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.940]   And he says this in 1 Peter 2, starting in verse one.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.780]   He says, "Therefore,"
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.660]   he, by the way, he's just talked about the gospel,
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.740]   he's just talked about the saving power of Jesus.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.420]   And he said, "Therefore, because of Jesus,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.780]   "rid yourself of all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy,
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.100]   "envy, and slander of every kind.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.480]   "Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk,
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.140]   "so that by it you may grow up,"
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.020]   notice this, "grow up in your salvation.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:36.020]   "Now that you have tasted and seen that the Lord is good."
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.740]   I want you to follow what Peter is saying here.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.540]   He's saying, you have, because Christ has saved you,
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.860]   because he's come into your life,
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.320]   you've tasted and seen that he is good.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.260]   That word good in the Greek is the same word for beauty.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.620]   You've tasted and seen the beauty of God.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.540]   That beauty has encountered you.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.320]   You were chaos, you've come into a greater place of order.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.580]   That's been good for you.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.940]   So now rid yourself of all of the stuff
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.020]   that's gonna take you back into chaos
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.420]   and crave this pure spiritual milk.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.560]   Come to the Lord, ask for his spirit to continue to fill you,
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.260]   to change you, to rejuvenate you,
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.420]   because you have seen his beauty
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.220]   and you are becoming more and more the beauty of God.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.520]   You tracking this?
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.580]   Okay, now notice what he says next.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.060]   "As you come to him, the living stone," that's Jesus,
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:32.300]   "rejected by men, but chosen by God and precious to him,
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.360]   "you also, like living stones,
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.140]   "are being built up into a spiritual house
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.900]   "to be a holy priesthood,
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.940]   "offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.220]   "through Jesus Christ."
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.420]   He's basically saying here,
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.260]   your salvation is not just for you personally on your own.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.040]   As much as you have tasted and seen that the Lord is good,
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.700]   now come with other fellow believers and become the church.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.660]   You are together, what Peter here says,
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.060]   is a holy priesthood.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.500]   The priests in those days were the ones
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.260]   who facilitated the relationship
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.460]   for people to encounter God.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.180]   Are you tracking the scripture?
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.740]   So Peter is saying, guess who are the people now
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.940]   who are gonna facilitate the encounter of people to God?
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.080]   The priests are now us, the church.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.260]   This is Peter saying the church must be active in the world,
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.020]   saying that the church is the signpost
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.220]   to the glory of God.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.900]   You who have encountered beauty are now to be together,
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.940]   building up a spiritual house
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.140]   that can be a royal priesthood
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.780]   so that anyone outside could see and know the glory of God.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.140]   Peter's passionate about this.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.480]   Let me jump down to verse nine.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.460]   He carries on the thread of the conversation.
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.900]   He says, "But you, the church, are a chosen people,
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.740]   "a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.260]   "a people belonging to God,
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.820]   "that you may declare the praises of Him
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.100]   "who's called you out of darkness into His wonderful light."
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.340]   Do you see the theological thread of beauty here, right?
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.740]   Remember, beauty is order out of chaos.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.620]   He says, "You guys have gone from darkness into light."
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.700]   That's the trajectory you've been on.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.020]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.580]   Now, don't waste what it is that God has done.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.900]   Verse 10, "Once you were not a people,
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.840]   "but now you are a people of God.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.480]   "Once you had not received mercy,
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.060]   "but now you have received that mercy.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.600]   "So dear friends, I urge you,
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.900]   "as aliens and strangers in this world,"
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.620]   because now you're a part of this new creation
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.200]   in Christ Jesus, "to abstain from sinful desires
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.920]   "which will war against your soul
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.700]   "and just bring you back into more chaos."
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.120]   Verse 12, "Here's what you should do.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.920]   "Live such good lives among the people around you
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.440]   "that though they accuse you of doing wrong,
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.240]   "they may see your good actions,
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.720]   "your good works, your good deeds,
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   "and glorify God on the day that He returns to us."
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.140]   This blows my mind, what Peter's saying here.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.140]   I need you just to sit with this for a moment, okay?
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.080]   Turn on those brains for a second, okay?
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.020]   This will blow your mind.
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.780]   Here's what Peter's saying.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.300]   He's saying that there is a moment,
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.620]   there is a time when Jesus is going to come back.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.220]   In the first century when they were writing,
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.420]   they thought that would happen at any moment.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.660]   He's like, Jesus is going to come back.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.180]   And when He comes back, everybody in the world,
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.300]   whether they're Christian or not,
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:31.300]   will know, taste, and see the glory and the goodness of God.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.680]   That's going to happen.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.080]   And he's saying, "Live such good lives today
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.780]   "that when Jesus comes back
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.540]   "and the people encounter the glory of God,
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.240]   "they connect the goodness and the glory of God
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.200]   "to what you had been doing back in that time.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.960]   "And when they make that connection, they will praise God."
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.400]   In other words, their praising of God will come
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.060]   because they'll connect the glory
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.840]   that they'll know of Jesus in that moment
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.960]   to the glory that they tasted when you were around them.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.520]   When you didn't slander them, you weren't malice.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.320]   When you walked in the opposite spirit,
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.240]   where you've had hope
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.880]   when everybody else seemed to be depressed,
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.200]   where you were a flower at a funeral,
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.080]   when you were trying to live
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.500]   with a different spirit in the world.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.640]   In all of those moments, they may slander you now,
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.900]   but when Jesus comes back, they will go,
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.220]   "Jesus was always with us."
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.580]   They're making sense?
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.200]   Jesus was always with us.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.640]   They'll connect the glory then to the glory now,
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.660]   and that will cause them to worship God.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.340]   That's an amazing statement.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:38.380]   Peter's saying, "Understand how important it is
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:43.140]   "to be these displays of the beauty of God."
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.020]   The word, interestingly, that Peter chooses here
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.900]   for good in verse 12 is the exact same word
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.780]   that Plato would use so often to speak about beauty.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.220]   Peter's writing about 300 years
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.720]   after Plato wrote "The Republic,"
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.620]   and he's writing into a Greco-Roman culture and context
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.540]   where they understood that it was shaped
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.260]   by much of what Plato, Aristotle,
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.540]   and the other philosophers had created.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.620]   And they would have recognized that this word
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.940]   that Peter is using here connects to the very same thing
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.180]   that Plato was speaking about,
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.380]   the idea and the concept of beauty.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.100]   And Peter is saying, "Live such beautiful lives,
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   "lives that are dedicated to walking out of chaos
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.240]   "into order, live such beautiful lives
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.120]   "that when people see the glory of God,
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.740]   "they'll connect it to the beauty that had been there,
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.620]   "and they will praise Him."
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.700]   It's a challenge by God to walk in beauty.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:46.700]   And we get to do this in big and small ways
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.940]   in all aspects of our lives.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.060]   Let me share a quick story with you.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.340]   Last, about a month ago,
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.620]   I finished my message here at the Vine.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.140]   I think it was the 11 o'clock service,
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.900]   and I finished my message.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.100]   And as I normally do, you might notice sometimes
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.500]   I walk out of the service before the service finishes.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.820]   Don't worry, I'm not going away to lunch early.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.820]   I normally go and stand at some point,
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.580]   whether in the upper house or here in the lower house,
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.780]   and say goodbye to you all as you leave.
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.880]   I was about to do that.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.340]   I went out here, out the back,
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.540]   and I was gonna come around to stand over here
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.000]   to say goodbye to you guys.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.140]   As I was out in the lobby,
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.460]   as the final worship song was playing in here,
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.460]   and you guys were all worshiping,
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.860]   somebody from our staff came up to me and said,
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.460]   "There's a gentleman crying in the staircase."
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.660]   And so I go into the staircase,
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.180]   and sure enough, there's a young boy.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.620]   He's probably like 24, 25 years old.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.380]   Young Chinese, local kid.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.920]   And he's crying his eyes out.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.820]   And I sit down and I introduce myself.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.520]   "Hey, I'm Andrew, one of the pastors here.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.100]   "Can I help you?"
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.140]   He can barely talk.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.060]   He can't explain what's happening.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.220]   He's just weeping and weeping.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.060]   And I'm sitting there with him.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.700]   And then, of course, the service finishes,
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.100]   and some 200 and something people
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.420]   are now rushing past us to get out.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.660]   And he's still crying, and it's a little bit awkward,
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.740]   and he needs some privacy.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.980]   So I help him, and we go into the little quiet room
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.620]   that's just in the back here.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.460]   And I sit down with him.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.420]   And for half an hour, I just try to draw out his story.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.340]   And slowly, he begins to unpack the reality
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.460]   that he's a drug addict.
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.120]   And he's been a drug addict for somewhat
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.420]   about two to two and a half years.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.840]   And he can't break his addiction.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.720]   And it's really been difficult, of course,
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.740]   for him and his family.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.560]   And he's trying to get sober.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.200]   So by the time that I met him, he was a week sober,
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.560]   about six days into sobriety, not having taken drugs.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.960]   And his whole body was screaming for the drugs, right?
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.400]   And so there was this complete internal turmoil,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.800]   chaos happening for him.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.000]   And he's not a Christian,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.220]   and he just thought a church might be able to help him.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.620]   He was so desperate that he literally showed up at the Vine,
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.460]   didn't come into the service,
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.580]   just out there in the corridor.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.820]   And so I had the opportunity to share the gospel with him.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.500]   Simple, nothing too fancy.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.020]   Just this is why we're here.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.020]   I can't change you.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.300]   A church isn't gonna change you,
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.980]   but Jesus might be able to help you, can help you.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.940]   Power of God to love and forgive you.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.480]   And I start telling him about the gospel,
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.780]   and he seems to calm down a little bit.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.620]   I said, "Are you hungry?"
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.440]   'Cause I'm hungry.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.340]   He's like, "Yeah, I'm starving."
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.260]   So we went for Japanese food for lunch.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.100]   Treated him to Japanese, it was awesome.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.420]   He had like a crazy fish, and he skinned the fish.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.260]   It was awesome.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.580]   And during the lunch, I was praying in tongues in my head,
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.140]   thinking to myself, like, "How can I help this guy?
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.940]   "How can I help this guy?"
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.860]   And I remembered that I've got some good friends
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.620]   in ministries here that help drug addicts.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.940]   And so I called up one of my friends,
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.260]   and I said, "Hey, I've got this guy,
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.220]   "and he seems to really wanna get off drugs,
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.380]   "but I'm not sure if we can help him.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.540]   "I think you guys might be able to."
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.800]   And I was able to connect him to that ministry,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.340]   and about four days later,
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.740]   he was accepted to go into that ministry.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.860]   And he sent me a WhatsApp last week,
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.660]   and he said, "It's been really hard,
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.640]   "but I'm going into the ministry.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.680]   "I'm committing to the ministry,
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.940]   "and I just wanna say thank you for the hope
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.860]   "that I have now."
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.620]   Now, I didn't really do much at all,
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.540]   other than take the time to listen to him,
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.460]   buy him some lunch, get him connected to someone.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.680]   I'm not the guy that's gonna see him come free.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.740]   That's the work of the Holy Spirit in his life.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.840]   But I felt like I was partaking somewhat,
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.980]   taking grain and grapes and creating some bread and wine,
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.920]   participating with this young man's life
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.560]   so that he might experience something different
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.880]   in the world, that there might be some more beauty for him.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.700]   And guess what?
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.600]   In that process, I felt like there was a little bit
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.160]   more beauty for me.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.080]   How about for you?
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.420]   Let me challenge you with this.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.440]   How might it be that you could usher
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.440]   in some beauty in this time?
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.340]   Where could you be bringing more order
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.760]   where there is chaos around you?
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.900]   What is it that you could usher in?
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.880]   Because that's what you've been created for.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.480]   That's who you are,
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.920]   somebody who gets to display the glory of God.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:56.900]   And so I wanna encourage some people in this room.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.760]   If you're a parent in this room,
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.480]   particularly if you're a single parent in this room
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.760]   who's struggling to raise a child,
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.360]   I wanna encourage you that every time you pause
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.040]   and take a moment, even in the hardness
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.760]   of raising that child, to speak life into them,
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.560]   to shape them, to bring some character into them,
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.040]   just to see them grow that next step,
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.260]   you are ushering in beauty.
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:20.680]   Or let me speak to our domestic workers in this room
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.680]   who so often you're working so hard
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.080]   and you don't seem to get appreciation at all.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.820]   You're dedicating yourself to bring order
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.360]   in the chaos of the family's home that you are living in.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.760]   And the hours that you put in
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.200]   where you never get any thanks for them.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.400]   God sees you and you are beautiful.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:42.000]   Or if you're a counselor, coach, social worker,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.120]   doctor, nurse, somebody in this room
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.840]   that's in the care industry, working on the front lines,
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.920]   meeting people daily who are broken
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.200]   and hoping that they will become whole again,
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.920]   and you're doing your skills and giving your life
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.240]   to be able to bring somebody along
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.320]   in a healing journey in some way,
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.000]   God sees you and you're beautiful.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.920]   If you're a lawyer in here
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.000]   hoping to make more justice in our city,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.960]   if you're a teacher here hoping to shape a young life,
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.780]   if you're working for the government here,
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.960]   hoping to bring some more structure to this place,
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.080]   if you're a police officer wanting to walk in integrity
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.720]   in the community that you're in,
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.800]   if you're a student wanting to study as well as you can,
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.480]   if you're a creative hoping to create something
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.760]   with your gifts and your skills
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.840]   that can say something about beauty in this world,
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.860]   if you're searching for employment right now,
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.120]   but you have this longing on your heart
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.040]   to contribute something to make this world a better place,
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.160]   all of you are beautiful.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.360]   And you're being called by God to lean into acts of beauty
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.360]   that can truly change the world.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.520]   Can beauty change the world?
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.720]   I look around this room, I look at you,
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.040]   and I am confident to say yes.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.940]   With what you can bring, with what is in your hand,
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.660]   participating in the work of the Holy Spirit,
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.740]   beauty can be seen.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.980]   One of the ways that we see beauty so often here at The Vine
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.880]   is through one of our ministries called Branches of Hope.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.060]   You may have heard of Branches of Hope,
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.060]   it's the work that we do with asylum seekers and refugees,
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.620]   as well as the work that we do in anti-trafficking.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.180]   And one of those ministries is stop,
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.940]   stop trafficking of persons.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.940]   And when I was writing this message,
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.740]   thinking about acts of beauty and the ways
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.980]   in which we actually funnel and bring beauty into the world,
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.700]   meeting people in darkness, bringing them into the light,
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.980]   I thought of the work of Stop,
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.460]   because they do this day in, day out,
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.060]   but we don't often get to talk about it
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:37.940]   too much on a Sunday.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.800]   And so I thought one of the great ways
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.340]   to finish this message would just be
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.180]   to have a short little conversation
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.380]   with the program director of Stop.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.220]   Her name is Michelle Wong, she's with us today.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.180]   Could you put your hands together
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.500]   as we invite Michelle to be here?
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.180]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.220]   How are you?
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.060]   - Good, good, thanks.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.220]   - I like your pink, I got pink today too.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.760]   - Oh yeah, because it's the branding color of Stop.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.620]   - I thought about that when I woke up this morning.
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.660]   I even have a pink clipboard here.
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.140]   - Oh wow, nice. - Yes, yes, yes, I know.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:12.380]   All right, so we've been talking a lot in this series
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.700]   about darkness, about chaos,
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.860]   and about the reality of that in the world.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.120]   And I know the work that you guys do in Stop,
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.880]   unfortunately means that you're entrenched
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.500]   in a lot of darkness as you're working with people
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.140]   that are caught in slavery.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.060]   Could you tell us a little bit
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.600]   about that experience for you?
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.020]   - Sure, so thank you Andrew for thinking of Stop
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.180]   and also the community of trafficking person.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.620]   And it is a privilege for me to speak here
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.960]   on behalf of the community as well.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.320]   So ever since I start to get in touch
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.280]   with survivors of human trafficking,
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.780]   I am shocked that how dark the world can be.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.260]   So human trafficking is a crime.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:02.260]   So it's by using the means like deception, coercion,
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:07.460]   the threat of violation and also abuse of power,
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:12.260]   the trafficker has a control over another person
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.540]   for the sake of exploitation.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:20.300]   So usually trafficker, they would offer false hope
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.420]   so that the people think that they can get
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.420]   into a great opportunity for a better future.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.060]   The trafficker use hope and trust as the bait
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.820]   to manipulate the vulnerable people
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.140]   to fall for their tricks
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.420]   and become the victim of trafficking.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.500]   So take one of our clients as example.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.940]   So one of our clients was betrayed by her friends.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:51.940]   Her so-called friends say that they will arrange
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.780]   a job opportunity for her in Hong Kong
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:00.020]   and then our clients paid 20,000 Hong Kong dollars
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.700]   to come to Hong Kong just to find out
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.580]   that the employment contract was fake.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.580]   And the employer stated in the contract didn't exist.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:16.900]   And then end up she spent two years staying in Hong Kong
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.580]   with no pay, no place to stay,
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:25.580]   fighting for a lawsuit and unable to support their families.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:30.580]   So usually trafficking victims,
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.960]   they are trapped by forced labor, sex trade,
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.340]   the freedom of movement is restricted.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.600]   And also they are suffering
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.320]   from excessive long working hours or debt bondage.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:50.040]   Yeah, so, but above all,
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:55.040]   no darkness can compare with losing hope in their life
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.160]   and also losing trust in people.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.120]   - I think when we think about our world,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.520]   which can be a very dark place,
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.560]   and like I say, you guys are experiencing that darkness
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.360]   at levels that many of us probably don't.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.460]   But for each one of us,
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.960]   when we see that darkness, it can be overwhelming.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.920]   And that often our response to being overwhelmed
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.760]   is that we shut down, we kind of avoid,
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.120]   or we run away or we don't actually walk in and offer hope.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.240]   We wanna kind of just avoid it
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.200]   or pretend it's not even there.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.120]   What are some ways that you guys have learned
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.000]   to kind of handle the darkness,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.080]   or at least to kind of not walk away,
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.320]   but actually walk towards it?
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.260]   - Yes, human beings, so we empathize.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:41.260]   So we built to show compassion to each other.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:46.100]   And we feel bad when we see someone is suffering, right?
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:52.320]   For instance, I remember one of our friends,
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.140]   we come across this case few years ago.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.260]   She was a drug mill.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.880]   So she was framed by a stranger in the airport.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.460]   And someone put drugs in her suitcase.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.220]   And right now she is halfway through
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:13.620]   her 10 plus year sentences in Hong Kong.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:18.220]   So stop team, we write letter to her regularly,
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.380]   and just to show her that someone out there
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.540]   is still supporting her and care about her.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.580]   But in this kind of situation,
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.100]   there's not much we can do.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.380]   So I think that sometimes when we see
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:38.380]   this kind of suffering, this is larger than us,
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.940]   seems like we feel quite helpless with that.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:48.180]   So people try to avoid this kind of problem.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   So to pretend that there's nothing bad
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.380]   happening in the world.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.380]   So there's a term called vicarious traumatization.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:05.500]   So usually it means that when we are indirectly exposed
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:10.300]   to this kind of bad things, chaos in the world,
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.180]   even us as an outsider, we will feel traumatized.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.340]   So I think that's why people want to live
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.260]   in their own little bubbles.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:21.780]   But that doesn't mean it would go away by itself.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.220]   So yeah.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:30.540]   - So for me, in the past years,
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.260]   for working with marginalized people,
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:39.140]   I often feel inspired by the strength of the survivors.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.220]   The more time I spend with them,
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:47.300]   the more admire from me to them
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.900]   about their strength and resilience.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.060]   So later on, I come across a term
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.780]   called vicarious resilience.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.780]   It means that positive transformation and empowerment
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.780]   just by witnessing the survivors
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.340]   being able to fight and strive.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:12.140]   So here I want to quote
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:19.980]   2 Corinthians 1.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:25.980]   "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:31.980]   the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.300]   who comfort us in all our troubles
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:40.300]   so that we can comfort those in any troubles
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.260]   with the comfort we ourself receive from God."
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:48.780]   So as us, we are very blessed being here.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.900]   And we, as a chosen one, I encourage you all
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.220]   to be the light for someone in the darkness.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.220]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.380]   What are some ways that, I think on Friday,
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.740]   we just celebrated the global day
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:05.340]   of kind of standing against those that are trafficking.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.380]   So that was a really important day
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.540]   for you and the work that you do.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.220]   But what are some ways that we can practically,
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.540]   as a church, continue to walk with stop,
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.500]   maybe support the work,
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.380]   or even use our sphere of influence
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.220]   to raise awareness, to shed that light
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.660]   in a pretty dark thing?
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.860]   - Yeah, so last Friday was World Day
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.980]   against trafficking in person.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.900]   So we had a little gathering with our clients,
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.580]   and our volunteer cooks meals with the clients,
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:36.060]   and we shared food, and then we play a little games.
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.900]   So we had a great time with lots of laughter.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:43.700]   Yeah, so I think for the church here,
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:48.700]   we are all here to support the vulnerable
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.660]   and marginalized people.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:55.660]   So I have few things that I want to ask you to do right now.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.860]   Can you all look at your phone out?
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.860]   And then, yeah, so can you see there's a QR code here?
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.500]   So the first thing I encourage you all to do
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.540]   is to educate yourself,
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.180]   to know more about human trafficking issue
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.220]   by following us on Facebook and Instagram.
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.100]   Sometimes our team would jokes about
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.100]   we are being like an influencer.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.500]   So I think everyone is an advocate here.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:29.220]   So just by learning about human trafficking issue,
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.380]   we can avoid contributing to the chain of modern slavery.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:38.380]   So if you feel resonated, you can share our post
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.620]   to let your friends know about modern slavery,
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.060]   the human trafficking,
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.060]   this kind of chaos that's happening in the world.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.100]   It can help to change the world a little bit by little bit.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.380]   That's great.
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.380]   And there's an info session coming up as well.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.420]   Yes, yes.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.140]   So last week we have this little postcard
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.420]   putting on the seats,
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.940]   but this time if you want to get it,
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:09.100]   you can find our booth outside of the auditorium.
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:13.460]   And this is a card that we made for World Day Against Trafficking.
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.820]   It said, "Illuminating another's path always brightens yours."
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.420]   So we got like six ways that you can join us
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.100]   to combat human trafficking with us.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.900]   And then on 15th of August,
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:32.100]   we have an info session for Stop in here in the Vine Church.
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.980]   So if you want to know more about Stop's work
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:38.620]   and also want to know more about the volunteer opportunities,
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:41.100]   you can scan the QR code here
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.420]   and then find more information and get to the sign-up link.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.980]   So I hope to see you all on that day.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.340]   Well, we really admire you, Michelle, and your team
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.580]   for the incredible work that you do,
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.340]   'cause it's not easy work.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.780]   But I think if there's ever an example
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.300]   of what acts of beauty look like,
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.900]   helping people to go from that place of chaos to order,
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.020]   it's what you guys are doing.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:01.860]   So we honor you.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.460]   Can we put our hands together and just...
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.620]   Bless, Michelle, thank you so much.
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.020]   Can you guys stand with me?
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.980]   And I wanna pray for us.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.380]   I wanna challenge and encourage you to consider
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.780]   what it is that you could do to bring more beauty
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.740]   into your sphere of influence,
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.420]   as you think about partnering in participation
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:22.300]   with the Holy Spirit in evangelism and mission
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.940]   and helping to see that order come
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.060]   from the chaos around us.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.340]   So why don't we pray together?
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:28.700]   Let's pray.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.700]   Father, we just thank you for each person in this room,
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.740]   each sphere of influence that they have
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.700]   and where you have planted them, Lord.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.740]   As we heard in that Isaiah passage,
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:42.060]   they are a planting of the Lord, each person here.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.060]   But they are also to be a display of your splendor,
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.860]   your glory, your goodness, your beauty.
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.420]   And Lord, we do that by reaching out
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.780]   in the various ways that we can,
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.940]   sharing your gospel,
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:59.540]   living such good lives as Peter challenges us
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.540]   before those in this world,
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.060]   that they can see a glimpse of what your beauty is,
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.020]   so that when you come into their lives,
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.860]   they will be able to connect those things together
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.540]   and praise you.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.860]   And Lord, we thank you for the 21 people
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.900]   getting baptized today,
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.340]   who are a beautiful picture to us
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.740]   of what that beauty looks like.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.220]   And Father, each one of us has our own testimony
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:23.340]   of the work that you've done in our lives in this area.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.860]   So Lord, would you give us better insight and wisdom
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.940]   how we can begin to do this more and more
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.940]   in the world that is around us?
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.060]   Would your spirit,
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.860]   because we recognize it is a work of your spirit,
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.860]   would your spirit fall on us,
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.020]   so that we may participate,
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.460]   taking that grain and the grapes,
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.020]   turning it into bread and into wine.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.180]   We thank you that you call us into that.
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.660]   What a privilege it is to be your people,
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.060]   your chosen people, your royal priesthood.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.460]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name,
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.060]   everyone says, amen.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.620]   Why don't we respond together in a time of worship?
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:07.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
