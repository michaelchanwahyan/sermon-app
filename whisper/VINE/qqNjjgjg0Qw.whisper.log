[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Thank you, Alison. Happy Chinese New Year, everyone.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   So I hope you all had some good time over the past few days,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.760]   perhaps enjoying some good food,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.680]   enjoying some time with your family and friends.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.440]   Or if you say, "Oh, I don't really celebrate Chinese New Year,"
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.760]   I hope you enjoy some time off during the public holiday as well.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.920]   So, my name is Jennifer.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.960]   I grew up in Hong Kong and my family is quite a traditional Chinese one.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.560]   So Chinese New Year has always been a big thing that we celebrate,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.880]   especially when I was a kid.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.280]   So there are a lot of things that we do as a family.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.480]   We need to clean our house.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.840]   We go visit our families.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.800]   We buy new clothes and we will host dinners at our place as well.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.200]   So it's been a lot that we do in the New Year,
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.160]   but the intention behind the whole thing is really
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.920]   we hope to start our year well.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.160]   So among all the things,
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.080]   there's one thing that I would like to highlight to you today
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.960]   is during Chinese New Year, we will say some blessings to each other.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.160]   So, for example, my family has been teaching me that
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.600]   each family can be different,
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.280]   but my family has been teaching me that
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.400]   the very first thing I say to a person
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.160]   if this is my first time seeing them in a New Year is a blessing.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.280]   So in case, like, for example, Gordon,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.840]   this is our first time meeting in a New Year.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.240]   So I'm supposed to say a blessing over him,
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.440]   something like "Happy Chinese New Year" or "Congratulations on Chinese New Year,"
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.280]   things like that.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.240]   The very first thing I say to him should be a blessing.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.760]   So let me introduce a few blessings
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.400]   that are commonly used among the Chinese community in Hong Kong.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.640]   So the first one, I think many of you will be heard of this,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.800]   is "Gong Hei Fat Choy."
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   It means "Wish you get rich."
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.160]   And then the second one is "Sun Tai Gin Hong,"
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.200]   is "Wish you good health."
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.040]   Sounds good, right?
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.240]   And then the third one is an interesting one
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.560]   that I would like to teach you,
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.560]   is "Sam Sang Si Sing."
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.640]   (audience murmurs)
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.480]   Doing good.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.400]   And the literal translation is,
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.640]   "I wish your heart desires come true."
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.280]   It sounds really good, right?
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.920]   Sometimes I really hope things happen that way,
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.400]   that, like, my heart desires will come true.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.840]   And, yeah, as I said, like, the whole idea behind this
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.720]   is to start our year well,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.320]   and there's also a belief behind that.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.480]   If we do these things, it will bring us good luck
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.040]   throughout the whole year.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.320]   So my family is not a Christian one,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.480]   so they really take this tradition very seriously.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.360]   So growing up, the very first thing I need to do
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.560]   on a New Year day, before even brushing my teeth,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.320]   is to go to my parents' bedroom
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.280]   and say at least three blessings to each of them.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.080]   If I pass the exam, I will get my life's seat.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.920]   (audience laughs)
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.760]   From them.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.000]   So that's how it works.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.840]   And also, my parents would always make sure
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.400]   I say the right thing to the right people,
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.640]   like, especially when they're around me.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.360]   So, for example, if I'm seeing an older person,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.200]   I must say, "I wish you good health."
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.800]   If I'm seeing a business person,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.160]   I must say, "I wish you get rich."
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.200]   So this is how serious it is for my family.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.320]   It sounds like an oral exam, I know,
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.480]   but sometimes I feel like it as well.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.520]   So, slowly, this whole tradition,
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.280]   because I have to do this every year,
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.320]   my parents will make me say something
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.240]   to them and to other people.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.120]   And it has become a formula to me in my head.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.240]   So whenever I see a person,
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.040]   my brain will automatically go search the right word
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.840]   I should say to them in a new year.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.440]   But do these words run through my heart?
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   Do I really bless them wholeheartedly?
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.120]   Maybe not.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   I almost feel like I'm just doing it for doing's sake.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.160]   I do it because this is what a Chinese does during CNY.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.320]   And how about you?
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.440]   If you're a Chinese in this room,
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.760]   perhaps you can resonate this with me as well.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.400]   Perhaps you also find yourself just blessing one another,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.960]   like out of the ritual or tradition.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   It feels like we are doing things out of habit.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.920]   And I hope I'm not lonely in this room feeling that way.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.520]   And perhaps for those who are not Chinese in this room,
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.520]   you might not 100% understand what I was saying,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.080]   but actually there are things
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.840]   we Christians say to each other as well.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.560]   Let me give you some example.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.920]   Like, God bless you.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.560]   Or I'll pray for you.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.840]   Or, I hear some laugh already.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.480]   Let's catch up some time.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.680]   How about this?
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.560]   Or I would like to involve more and serve more.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.080]   Do they sound familiar?
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.680]   Yeah, these are the things that we say to each other as well.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.880]   But are we saying from the bottom of our hearts,
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.960]   do we always mean it?
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.680]   Or do we always back our words with our actions?
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.120]   Last week, Pastor Promise shared with us
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   that Jonathan said he loved David as himself.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.800]   And Jonathan backed these words up
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.400]   with his whole life, actually.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.600]   So for us as well,
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.400]   it is important to back our words with actions.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.520]   And right now, we are still at the beginning of the year.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.280]   Do any of us have the New Year resolution
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.960]   of spending more time with God,
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.920]   or spending more time to pray,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.600]   or spending more time to read the Bible?
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.840]   I'm one of them.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.400]   So how is it going?
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.560]   I need to confess that I say these things every year
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.120]   at the beginning of the year.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.840]   But when my schedule gets full,
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.000]   the first thing I sacrifice is spending time with God too.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.200]   And of course, personally,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.480]   I want to spend more time with God.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.680]   And I'm sure all of us in this room
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.040]   would want to be closer to God as well.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.720]   We want to be more like Jesus.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.200]   We want to make Him pleased with all the things we do.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.560]   But why do we stop at wanting to do something,
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.960]   but not making it happen?
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.200]   Why do we say we are going to do something,
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.160]   but not following through with it?
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.400]   So to be honest, our faith does not work
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.480]   like the Chinese New Year blessing,
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.200]   may your heart's desire come true.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   Our heart's desire do not just come true automatically.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.800]   And we always need to do something and make them happen.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.480]   In the year of 2025, as a church,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.400]   we have a theme of action.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   I think many of us are very excited
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.440]   to do something together.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.560]   It is really essential to allow our action
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.160]   to align with our heart's desire,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.520]   and more importantly, to align with our faith.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.320]   We don't want to do something together just for doing's sake
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.000]   or the other way around,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.640]   that we want to do something,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.760]   but we stop at just wanting or saying
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.480]   and end up not doing it.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.200]   So it is amazing that there's a whole book in the Bible
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.040]   that tells us about moving our faith into action.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.640]   As we read it, we might find his theology
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.800]   a little bit different from Paul's
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.200]   saved by faith along theology,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.000]   as he argues the importance of action coming with our faith.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.560]   But if we look into it deeper,
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.800]   we will find it makes sense
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   because he asks practical application to Paul's theology.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.080]   And this book is written by the apostle James,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.760]   and therefore the book is called the book of James.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.000]   We will look into a few verses in chapter two today.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.400]   And let me read it for you.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.120]   What good is it, my brothers and sisters,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.840]   if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.040]   Can such faith save them?
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.840]   Suppose a brother or a sister
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.600]   is without clothes and daily food.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.720]   If one of you says to them,
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.840]   "Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,"
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.320]   but does nothing about their physical needs,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.120]   what good is it?
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.740]   In the same way, faith by itself,
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.200]   if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   But someone will say, "You have faith, I have deeds.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.160]   "Show me your faith without deeds,
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.080]   "and I will show you my faith by my deeds."
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.120]   You believe that there is one God, good.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.760]   Even the demons believe that and shudder.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.480]   You foolish person, do you want evidence
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   that faith without deeds is useless?
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.600]   Was not our father Abraham considered righteous
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.080]   for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.960]   You see that his faith and his actions were working together
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.260]   and his faith was made complete by what he did.
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.800]   And the scripture was fulfilled that says,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.400]   "Abraham believed God and it was credited to him
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.580]   "as righteousness, and he was called God's friend."
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.160]   You see that a person is considered righteous
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.480]   by what they do and not by faith alone.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.180]   In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.660]   considered righteous for what she did
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.640]   when she gave lodging to the spies
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.180]   and sent them off in a different direction?
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.140]   As the body without the spirit is dead,
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.060]   so faith without deeds is dead.
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:30.440]   So here, James is clarifying what a true faith is,
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.340]   what it means to be a Christian.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.020]   James asked us a question.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.200]   What good is faith without deeds?
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.000]   In other words, what good is faith without action?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.080]   Is faith only about believing
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.560]   there's one God who is Jesus Christ?
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.620]   Let's ask ourselves this question for a moment.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.720]   Is our faith authentic faith
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.440]   if we never reach to a point of action?
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.780]   We can imagine if the apostles who had faith,
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.760]   but they never reached to a point of action,
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.800]   I think the church today would not have existed.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.280]   And as Jesus called the disciples,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.360]   he did not just call them to believe
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.520]   that he is the son of God.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.180]   In fact, Jesus called the disciples to follow,
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.840]   and following is an action.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.520]   Some of you might start thinking,
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.140]   didn't Jesus and the apostle Paul emphasize
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.040]   that we are saved by faith and grace
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.020]   instead of following the law?
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:45.100]   That is very true that we are saved by grace of God alone.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.860]   And in fact, we can never save ourselves by doing anything.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.400]   The deeds James is referring here
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.080]   isn't the deeds of the law,
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.400]   but the deeds as a demonstration of our faith outwardly.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.000]   It might sound similar or it might look the same
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.520]   because we can be doing the same thing,
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.020]   but internally it could be very different.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.520]   Let me give you a simple example.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.720]   So let's talk about praying before a meal.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.520]   So I grew up with a teaching that if I am a real Christian,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.800]   I must pray before every meal.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.440]   And it doesn't matter whom I'm eating with,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.640]   it doesn't matter whether or not they are Christians,
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.320]   but my prayer needs to be visible
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.880]   to the people I'm eating with.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.640]   I can be praying silently,
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.680]   but I need to show that I'm praying
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.520]   and show that I'm a Christian.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.440]   So if we think about this,
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.920]   like it sounds like the works of the law, right?
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.720]   Because it operates like this,
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.440]   because we are a Christian,
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   therefore we need to pray before every meal
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.880]   to show that I'm a Christian.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.080]   But while there are other people
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.760]   who praise before every meal,
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.200]   because they believe that,
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.720]   we believe that everything is provided by God,
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.760]   every meal is provided by God.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.160]   So we want to give him thanks before every meal.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.960]   And it is totally different from the motive.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.480]   Like it is an outworking action from what we believe.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.480]   So these two things, these two examples,
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.360]   they can look exactly the same.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.600]   We are both like, they're all praying before a meal,
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.240]   but they actually come from very different motives.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.800]   And therefore they can have very different results.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.960]   And I want us to pay attention
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.960]   to how James understands the relationship
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.000]   of faith and deeds.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.200]   In verse 14, he says,
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.600]   "What good is it if someone claims to have faith,
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.560]   "but has no deeds?"
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.160]   Let's pay attention here.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.400]   James didn't say,
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   "What good is it if someone has faith, but has no deeds?"
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.760]   He said, "Someone who claims to have faith."
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.320]   In other words, James is referring to someone
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.320]   who says they have faith,
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.240]   but never reached to a point of action.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.760]   And these people, they are deceiving themselves.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.060]   And the faith is just a self-declaration.
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.760]   But again, James is not introducing
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.000]   some new salvation formula
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.760]   that is different from Jesus' teaching.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.160]   He's not telling us that faith plus action
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.400]   equals to salvation.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.660]   It's not like now we have faith in Jesus
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.800]   and we add a little bit of action in there,
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.920]   then that's salvation.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.480]   He is telling us that faith by its own nature
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.780]   includes action.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.720]   In other words, action is the result of our faith.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.740]   We desire to do something for God
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.040]   because we have been given a new hope,
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.800]   a new life, a new identity.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.080]   And out of the faith and salvation,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.240]   we have received from God,
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.280]   we put that salvation into practice.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.460]   It doesn't add to our salvation,
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.000]   it is an outworking of our salvation.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.420]   So action is the natural result of our faith.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.960]   So we can't have faith but do nothing about it.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.480]   And James used Abraham as an example,
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.720]   that Abraham has faith,
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.240]   but he also had deeds that originated in his faith.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.680]   And because of his actions that followed from his faith,
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.200]   God declared him as righteous.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:48.380]   Faith is like a seed planted inside each one of us
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:53.000]   and our words and our actions are the fruits of our faith.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.600]   In fact, we are all different
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.440]   and our action can look very differently.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.160]   And most of us here in this room,
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.360]   I'm sure you're not called to sacrifice your son, right?
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.200]   Right, Alison?
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.240]   [audience laughing]
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.080]   But there is one thing that is applicable
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.200]   to all of us today is like,
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.120]   there is a cost in following Jesus.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.480]   It means putting our faith into action,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.520]   it means following God's call and do something.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.040]   And it could look differently to each of us.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:34.020]   So I would like to ask, how is God calling you to act?
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:39.160]   Is there anything God is conflicting you to do for him
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.300]   in the coming year?
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:45.400]   One more thing I would like to highlight in this passage
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   is that James concerns our faith in relation to others.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.280]   He gave us a scenario in verses 15 to 16
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.000]   that if a person who has no clothes, no daily food
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.680]   and he came to us, but if we say to them,
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.060]   go in peace, keep warm and well fed,
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.280]   but do nothing about their physical needs,
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.980]   how do we feel about this?
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.920]   It sounds terrible, right?
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.400]   But if we are honest,
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.140]   sometimes we Christians do this as well.
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.540]   When we see people in need, we might say,
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.200]   God bless you or I'll pray for you.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.700]   Praying is great and blessing people is wonderful as well,
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.260]   it's powerful.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.580]   We need to continue to do this to people.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.580]   But let's be reminded that our faith cannot stop
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.780]   at saying something nice to each other,
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.980]   but not doing anything about it.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:51.000]   James says, such faith is dead.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.900]   Let's do better than this.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:57.160]   So what does living faith mean?
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:02.060]   If we read the rest of the book of James,
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.220]   which is heavily on the topic of faith and deeds,
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.140]   he says a lot about our relationship with other.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.620]   He speaks again favoritism,
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.820]   he says about caring for the poor.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.460]   Again, this is not some laws for us to follow,
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.040]   but our faith conflicts us to showcase the love of God
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.000]   to people around us.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.940]   This is who God is.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.940]   This is a God who loves and cares for people,
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.200]   not just saying it, but through our action.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.040]   And sometimes it will mean meeting people's physical needs.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.080]   I'm not saying that we need to meet everyone's need
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   when they come all the time,
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.720]   but sometimes it does mean that we need to meet
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.600]   physical needs of people.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:54.960]   And more importantly, God called us to be part of his action.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.160]   He called us to be more like him.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.160]   And through our actions, we are demonstrating who God is
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.460]   to the people around us.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.940]   It is always about people.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.080]   God does not just intend us to be isolated
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.360]   and to be close to him only.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.680]   God always intend us to follow our faith
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.520]   to shape us in how we are interacting with people.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:28.880]   This is also what Jesus commanded us, to love one another.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.400]   As we are actioning, it is important to keep in mind
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.480]   that we are not just doing something good
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.080]   in the public's eyes,
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.260]   but we are actually doing the work of God
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.340]   as the followers of Jesus.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.300]   As the love of God is in us,
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.880]   and we are to reflect who God is
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.380]   and bring the love of God to the world.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.320]   This might sound very big and scary,
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.380]   but loving people can be really reflected
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.420]   in the smallest ways on a personal level.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.720]   It is really a way of living.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.160]   So how do we do this?
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.480]   How do we practically put James' call into action
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.760]   in the city of Hong Kong?
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.400]   In a relationship that we had around us?
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.040]   How do we ensure we're not just saying words,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.760]   but putting our faith into action?
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.560]   Let me give you a few examples
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.280]   to help you to think about this,
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.160]   and then you can think about how you can apply it
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.000]   into your own life.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.280]   So in today's culture, people tend to put ourselves first,
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.240]   especially in Hong Kong.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.560]   We value efficiency and convenience.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.640]   We can't waste one minute on anything, really.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.300]   If we get to the train station,
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.860]   if we see the next train is in three minutes,
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.520]   it's too long, right?
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:53.160]   And you can tell how efficient we are
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.400]   by how we walk on the street,
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.960]   by how we drive on the road, right?
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.200]   So Hong Kong people do not really value being considerate,
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   to be honest.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.080]   So, (laughs)
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.040]   so what does following Jesus in this space look like?
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.000]   How can we be considerate to people
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.240]   as we are living in this environment?
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.160]   And also, with our friends as well,
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.480]   we always say to each other,
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.920]   "Let's catch up more, let's hang out."
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.400]   But do we always put that in our schedule
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.720]   and make time for that?
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.040]   Or we put it in our schedule,
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.440]   it makes it to my schedule,
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.360]   but I don't feel like it on the day,
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.240]   so what do I do?
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.840]   These things sound familiar, right?
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.580]   So what does loving people mean in this space as well?
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.760]   And I think being consistent and honoring people's time
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.100]   is one way to do it.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.380]   And our faith does not only exist for the big moments,
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.880]   the turning points in our life.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.800]   Our faith is also reflected in these smallest things
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.280]   in our everyday life, how we treat people,
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.300]   how we make choices,
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.360]   how we choose to put other people's needs above ourselves.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:20.480]   Where do we choose to sit or stand in a public transport
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.560]   or on a Sunday, or in what condition
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.300]   we are leaving the bathroom to the next person
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.280]   is one way to reflect it.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.280]   These smallest things in our life,
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.040]   have we thought about what kind of faith
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.640]   are we demonstrating, or what do we want to demonstrate?
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   How is your faith conflicting you
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.900]   on how to interact with people?
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.780]   Is your faith conflicting you to do something
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.240]   for the people in need?
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:58.740]   Let me share my story of how God conflicted me personally
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.940]   to put my faith into action when I was in seminary.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.740]   So I started studying in seminary
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.460]   before I actually started working in ministry.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:14.300]   I was working in corporate, I was thinking about ministry,
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.300]   so I started a part-time program in a seminary.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.240]   And then later I joined the staff team at the Fine,
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.740]   so I've started working here also as a full-time staff.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.660]   So in my seminary life,
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.540]   I have always been a part-time student
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.980]   with a full-time job.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.120]   As you can imagine,
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:40.980]   I need to be quite diligent with how I use my time.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.780]   I need to set good boundaries at work
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.700]   so I can get off on time and show in school, in person,
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.620]   and yes, my school requires me to go in person all the time.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.900]   And then also to make time to do my coursework as well,
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.580]   to write assignments, write the papers,
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.100]   so my time being in school campus
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.020]   has always been very functional.
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.060]   When I show up in school, I was either in class
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.060]   or either I'm hiding in library doing my research
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.320]   and doing my homework.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.200]   By the way, I love working in library.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.180]   It's quiet, it has a lot of books and resources,
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.140]   and I can be quiet processing the thoughts in my mind,
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.980]   so I really love that.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:27.460]   However, one big belief of my school
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.460]   is that we are a learning community,
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.980]   and community plays a big part in our learning
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.900]   and equipping process, which I really appreciate now,
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.700]   not so much back then.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.660]   So whenever my school has some optional events,
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.260]   like show-show events,
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.680]   I had a very easy excuse that I say all the time.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.060]   I'm just a part-time student,
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.740]   I can't commit to anything else.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.860]   So my school was very gracious
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.420]   to part-time students like me,
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.860]   and I held on to my excuse for a few years.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.340]   In my first few years, I was really happy with my pattern,
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.300]   but until I started working here in ministry,
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.220]   I started to feel that my study pattern doesn't seem right.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.520]   It feels like I'm just there
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.220]   to fulfill the course requirement
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.880]   and to just get a degree.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.900]   Although if I was still able to learn something new,
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.300]   that was not enough.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.740]   So I realized my pattern does not allow me
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:33.740]   to fulfill what I was sensing God is calling me to do.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.940]   Something needs to change.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.580]   If I also believe that community plays a part
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.860]   in my learning and equipping process,
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.260]   I can't be just showing up to the class
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.160]   and then hiding in the library all the time.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.980]   If I also believe that community
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.060]   is an expression of my faith,
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.780]   if I believe that Jesus is calling me
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.180]   to learn with those people,
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.660]   I need to actually spend time with them.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:09.180]   And my next steps is to actually doing it.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.120]   I can't be saying to my schoolmates
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.080]   that I want to get more involved
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.380]   and spend more time with you,
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.200]   but not doing anything about it.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.940]   I needed to sort out my priorities.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.300]   It doesn't mean that I don't care
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.820]   about my work here or my study anymore.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.940]   Those two things still have higher priority in my life,
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.420]   but I needed to prioritize my schoolmates,
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.620]   perhaps over my excuses at the moments
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.300]   that I don't feel like it.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:45.560]   And I need to prioritize people over my comfort zone,
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.640]   which is the library.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.580]   I needed to change my pattern,
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.340]   which means showing up to the common area
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.480]   instead of the library,
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.580]   make time to talk to people,
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.720]   enjoying their social events.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.540]   And I needed to drop my excuses
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.840]   and walk out of my comfort zone.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.620]   Was I stretched?
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.500]   Absolutely.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.900]   Does it worth it?
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.800]   Even so.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.320]   So I wonder if you're holding on to any excuses
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.480]   and allowing those to stop you
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.360]   from doing what God is calling you to do.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:28.620]   As I shared at the beginning,
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.380]   during CNY, we often say things to people out of habit
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.900]   or rituals, but not really meaning it.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:38.640]   We can't go forward as Christians here,
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.760]   especially in the year of action in 2025
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.300]   with the same attitude.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.900]   We must check our hearts and ask ourselves,
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.900]   where our motives are coming from.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.380]   This is step number one.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.460]   But we can't stop here.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:59.420]   We can't just follow with our mouths only.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.420]   We must put our faith into action.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.980]   In order to do that,
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.860]   we will look into some practical ways
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.940]   we can put our faith into actions.
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.660]   So the first one is to seek God.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.500]   As I said just now,
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.760]   checking our hearts and motive is step one.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.800]   Before we take any actions,
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.820]   we need to be intentional about
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.820]   to allow God speak to us on what and how to act,
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.460]   just like what the apostles did.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.220]   Like I said, it doesn't have to be big things all the time.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.540]   We can ask God each day how we can demonstrate our faith
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.380]   and his love before we go about our day,
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.740]   before we go to work, before we go to school,
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.940]   when we wake up in the morning or on our way.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.780]   We can ask God about that.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.860]   And also, if you have important things during the day,
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.300]   do that before your important meetings.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.900]   Ask God how would he want you to act.
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:10.100]   And then number two is we need to watch our choices.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.380]   As we go about our day,
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.460]   there are a lot of things we do out of habits,
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.140]   like getting on trains, going to work,
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.880]   going out for lunch, doing our groceries.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.620]   We might not pay attention to these moments,
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.780]   but there are actually a lot of human interactions
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.380]   in those spaces,
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.660]   and we make a lot of choices out of habit.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:35.980]   So perhaps we can be intentional about our choices
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:37.580]   and ask ourselves,
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.260]   are we choosing to be considerate to people?
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.460]   Are we choosing to demonstrate love
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.420]   to people with our choices?
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:51.340]   And number three, it is our priorities.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.460]   Let's be honest, we all have limited time and resources.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.420]   As we look at our schedule, ask ourselves,
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.820]   what are our top priorities
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.900]   that we must give our attention to?
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.540]   And what are the things that are occupying us
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.480]   from doing the important things?
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.740]   And are there any excuses we are holding onto,
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.640]   like what I did in seminary?
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:20.620]   If there is something that God is convicting us to do,
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.620]   we need to make time for that
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.440]   and make them one of our priorities.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.960]   And the final one is to honor our promises.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.420]   If we say to God or we say to each other
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.460]   that we will do something, let's honor that.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.120]   If you are bad at this, perhaps put it in your diaries
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.240]   or setting an alarm or reminder,
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.880]   or perhaps ask someone who is close to you
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.640]   to keep you on track and hold you accountable.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.420]   Just find a way that is workable for you.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:01.020]   And let's approach 2025 together
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.680]   with putting our words into action and live out our faith.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.220]   If we want to spend more time to read the Bible,
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.540]   open the Bible and read it.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.380]   I can't think of anything else
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.420]   that other way that we can do it.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.540]   If you want to spend more time to pray,
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.980]   take away your phone or other distractions and pray.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.380]   This is the only way to do it.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.220]   If you want to serve the people around you,
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.380]   make sure you commit yourself to prioritize this
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.900]   so you don't make people down.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.920]   And I hope in 2025, we will be a community
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.340]   that allow our faith to shape us inwardly and outwardly.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.060]   And also as a community,
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.640]   as we are entering into a year of action,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:54.620]   if you also believe that action is part of our faith,
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:58.620]   get ourself ready to be part of the action.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.580]   Not because everyone else is doing it,
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.300]   not just doing it for doing's sake,
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.420]   but let's demonstrate our faith as a church.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:12.040]   So I hope this is encouraging,
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.980]   this excites you to do something for God.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.020]   As I said, it could look very differently to each one of us
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.500]   because we are all unique
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.980]   and we all have different sphere of influence.
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:29.260]   So I'm not sure how you feel about this
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.620]   or how clear you feel that God is calling you
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.140]   to do something, but I'm sure if you are a believer,
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.140]   you have a relationship with Jesus.
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.300]   He has a purpose in you.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.580]   And there is a way that you can be part of his action,
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.960]   no matter in a big way or in a small way.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:55.060]   So may I invite you to stand as we pray to close.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.220]   (silence)
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:06.960]   Dear Jesus, we thank you.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:14.460]   We thank you that you are such an almighty God
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:21.140]   and with all the powers in your hand,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.000]   you can basically do anything by yourself,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.180]   but you have chosen us to be your people
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:34.000]   and you have chosen us to be part of your action.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.980]   Lord, we thank you so much for this opportunity
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.300]   and we thank you so much
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.380]   that we are called to be your people.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:50.500]   Lord, we pray for each one of us in this room.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:58.620]   We believe that you have a purpose in each one of us.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:05.240]   You intend us to shine for you
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.080]   and to be your hands and feet
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.680]   in our different spaces we have in our lives.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:19.520]   That you intend us to love the people around us
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.520]   and to show what your love is to the people around us.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:34.800]   So Lord, we pray that your Holy Spirit will show us
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:41.560]   how we can love the people around us,
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.080]   how we can be in action for you,
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.720]   not only in the big moments,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:53.720]   remind us to not overlook the small everyday moments.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:57.540]   Show us what you see.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.560]   Show us how we can serve you
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.360]   and serve other people in those areas.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.960]   And also to allow us to grow in loving people and compassion.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:17.240]   And we pray for those who of us
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:22.000]   who might not 100% sure what the purpose is,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.280]   how we can follow this.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.640]   Lord, we pray that you will show us,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:31.780]   not only show us, but you will take us on this journey
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:36.200]   and you will show us on each step we are taking.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:44.240]   And for those of who of us are really excited about this,
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.880]   we already know that you have put a calling in us.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.600]   We are excited to put that calling into action
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.120]   in the coming year.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.480]   Lord, we pray that you will remind us
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.280]   to be even more attentive to your heart,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.720]   to seek you first before we do anything,
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.960]   to seek you all the time.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.420]   Lord, may you give us an attentive heart.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.160]   And we invite the Holy Spirit to continue
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.580]   to config us as one community,
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.920]   to config us on how we can serve you together
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.300]   as one church, as one community.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:32.100]   And if we are holding onto any fears, any excuses,
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:36.120]   we pray that you will give us the courage
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.000]   and you will give us the strength to overcome them.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.440]   Lord, thank you that you have sent us
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.880]   to be part of your action,
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.740]   and yet you didn't leave us alone.
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.840]   And your Holy Spirit is always there
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.720]   to guide us and lead us.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:01.680]   And we have one another to do them together.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.520]   So Lord, in the coming year,
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.600]   we pray that we can be your hands and feet
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.120]   and we can bring your love to the world around us.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.140]   And we thank you in Jesus' name.
