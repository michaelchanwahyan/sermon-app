[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180]   We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.020]   Thank you, church.
[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.840]   Thank you, worship team.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.660]   That was a beautiful time of singing
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.900]   and worshiping together.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.740]   You may have a seat.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.140]   As you sit down, there might be someone new next to you,
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.460]   so you can say hi.
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.560]   If you have some seats free next to you as well,
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.820]   just hold up your hand, let our host know,
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.900]   so that we still have some people that are standing by,
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.860]   wanting to get a seat.
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.860]   So if there's a seat free next to you,
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.140]   you can hold up your hand.
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.900]   Our host will come and fill up as many people
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.060]   as we can in this room.
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.500]   If you're in the overflow, a big welcome to you.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.640]   Thank you for being here with us.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.440]   And if you're joining us online,
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.420]   a very good morning from Hong Kong.
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.740]   Wherever you're joining us from, welcome as well.
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.220]   So we've kicked off this sermon series
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.460]   that we've called Uncharted.
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.240]   And actually, I figured something out.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.400]   It's actually quite a good way to get away with stuff
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.580]   in the office these days, right?
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.620]   So for example, if you do something like,
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.100]   you know, go for a three-hour lunch,
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.520]   and you come back, and Carla's like,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.360]   where have you been?
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.460]   It's like, oh, on a lunch.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.300]   Say, what's three hours?
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.820]   Well, it's Uncharted, right?
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.820]   I mean, we've never taken three-hour lunches before,
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.540]   but now it's the way we're gonna do things.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.740]   And so, just being cheeky.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.700]   But you know, I figured it could be
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.260]   like a get-out-of-jail-free card sometimes as well.
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.220]   But we are, we're in this new sermon series
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.180]   we've called Uncharted, where we feel like God
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.380]   in this year has challenged us with a vision
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.360]   to go places we've never gone before.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.420]   Right, no strategy, no knowledge,
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.340]   no necessarily any plans or steps
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.320]   that we are intending to take,
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.360]   but just be wide open in going
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.780]   where God is leading us to go.
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.840]   But a lot of that has to do,
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.500]   starts with the way we think, right?
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.280]   We have to be thinking right.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.280]   We have to be thinking as God is thinking
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.640]   in order for go and do where he's called us to do,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.340]   and go where he's called us to go.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.520]   And our thoughts are with us all the time.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.660]   You know, growing up, there's certain things
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.280]   I've realized now that have been so ingrained,
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.720]   like incepted into my mind that as I grew up,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.560]   as an adult, as you live life,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.040]   you realize actually has a bigger impact
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.560]   on you than you first realize.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.000]   Right, some of these are funny and nonsensical, right?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.840]   You probably have heard some of these things.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.320]   For example, my mom and my grandma always told me
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.080]   that if you sleep with the fan on blowing in your face,
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.920]   right, you will suffocate and die, okay?
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920]   I'm sure I'm not the only one
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.620]   that's been growing up with that thought, right?
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.180]   If you don't sleep with the fan on,
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.680]   it's gonna blow against your nose,
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.540]   and then the air, something happens, right?
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.440]   And then you will die in your sleep, okay?
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.120]   Another way, okay, another thing
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.480]   that my parents often told me was
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.440]   if you don't finish every single grain of rice
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.880]   in your bowl, okay, that's gonna be a mark
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.520]   on your future wife's face, okay?
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.760]   Now, my wife is sitting here right now.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.880]   You can see no marks on her face, very pretty, okay?
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.800]   But, right, so I would eat all my rice, right?
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.760]   Am I right?
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.900]   You have to eat every single grain of rice, okay?
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.260]   And otherwise, you're gonna end up
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260]   with a scarred-faced woman.
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.260]   So, growing up, I was always very hot and very full, okay?
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.300]   Now, I'm addicted to rice these days.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.340]   You can ask my friends, like,
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.860]   if there's rice, I will always eat it.
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.820]   Right, so there's some funny ways, okay?
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.060]   But some of these other thoughts
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.660]   that I feel like were imprinted into my mind
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.740]   were slightly more damaging, right?
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.740]   For example, I developed a huge fear of making mistakes,
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.880]   right, because making mistakes often led
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.520]   to harsh punishment from my mom.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.160]   And so, instead of admitting to mistakes,
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.280]   I would hide, I would lie to cover things up.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.120]   But, of course, as you know, the more you hide,
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.560]   the more you lie, the bigger trouble I would get in
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.600]   in the end, and the more punished I would be, right?
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.140]   And I realized it started to affect
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.360]   the way I express myself, right?
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.040]   I began to believe that, you know,
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.720]   actually, I can't make any mistakes at all,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.800]   so I have to keep everything hidden inside, right?
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.720]   I might feel this way, but I'm not gonna say it, right?
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.800]   'Cause I might be wrong, and if I'm wrong,
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.840]   then I'm gonna be punished.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.560]   Now, I used to think everybody thought like this.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.420]   This was just a normal way to function in life, right?
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.760]   Until after I got married, I realized,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.400]   actually, I should say it was pointed out to me, okay,
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.140]   that this pattern of thought was deeply affecting me, right?
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.680]   Because 100% it affected the way I was communicating
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.640]   with Brittany and the quality of our marriage.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.960]   Now, I will also say this, right?
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.200]   I love my mom deeply, and over the years,
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.080]   she and I have had some, started to have some
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.280]   really beautiful but hard conversations
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.560]   about the way she raised me, right?
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.920]   These healing and forgiving sort of conversations
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.280]   about my childhood and her childhood,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.720]   and as we talked, I began to realize that the reason
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.640]   why fear was such a big part of my upbringing
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.080]   was because she was also raised in an environment
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.760]   where fear was even more deeply saturated
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.640]   into a background and punishment from my grandparents
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.120]   to her and her siblings, and so through a little bit
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.320]   of counseling to try and help me out, right,
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.560]   Brittany and I, I tried to express myself
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.480]   as best as I can these days.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.880]   I tried to be intentional, not to let my own negative
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.160]   experiences now also shape the way I parent my two boys,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.320]   but what I've come to realize is that for things
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.280]   to really change, I really have to go back to the source,
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.120]   right, and change the way I think, right?
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.400]   I have to tell myself, remind myself literally these days
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.320]   that it's okay to make mistakes, right?
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.600]   No one's gonna come at me with a feather duster
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.640]   for the bad thing that I did, all right?
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.920]   Now, this is just a personal example,
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.200]   but the point I'm trying to make is this, right?
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.440]   It's not very hard to see that our thinking patterns
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.880]   have a significant effect on our beliefs
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.640]   and how we live our life and our behaviors,
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.480]   all right, which is why with this vision
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.080]   that the Lord has given us to embrace the uncharted,
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.620]   to go forth into territory that we've never been before,
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.480]   we have to be open-minded, and if God wants to change
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.840]   the way we think, we have to let the Holy Spirit
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.160]   challenge us in our beliefs and challenge us
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.440]   in our behaviors and challenge us in our traditions
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.400]   to go where God wants us to go, right?
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.720]   We sang this just now.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.800]   Shake up the ground of my traditions.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.920]   Bring down the walls of my religion.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.520]   Now, again, don't get me wrong.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.520]   I'm not saying all religions and traditions are bad, right?
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.120]   There are lots of tenets of truth and traditions
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.240]   that play an important role in our faith, right?
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.400]   There's certain tenets and pillars of the Christian faith
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.440]   that I would say are definitely true
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.360]   and unshakeable and unmovable,
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.640]   and anyone who tells you anything else, it's a liar, right?
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.640]   For example, Jesus is the only way, the truth and the life.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.360]   That cannot be changed, okay?
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.300]   That there is one God who exists as the Father and Son
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.720]   of the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.560]   You will never change that.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.880]   That's just a fact, okay?
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.260]   That Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life,
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.080]   died on the cross as a perfect sacrifice for our sins,
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.700]   was resurrected on the third day,
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.640]   and sits enthroned in heaven.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.680]   He's coming back to restore his creation
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.280]   and judge the living and the dead.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.480]   Okay, that is a fact that you can never change.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.760]   We have God's word, these 66 books that God has given us
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.040]   as Holy Scripture.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.160]   The words of this book will never change.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   No one can ever add or take away from this book.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.620]   We have beautiful traditions like communion,
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.520]   which we celebrate every month, right?
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.560]   Some churches celebrate it even more, right?
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.360]   It's a reminder of God's love and sacrifice
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.760]   and his presence with us.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.240]   We have baptism, where we publicly display our faith
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.080]   in Jesus.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.120]   These are some traditions and things, part of our faith,
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.380]   that are unshakable, unmovable.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:50.520]   On the other hand, though, we have to be careful
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.760]   not to let other things bind us so much
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.520]   that the new and fresh things that God wants us to do
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.720]   are hindered by these barriers that we put up in our lives.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.680]   And unless we're willing to embrace God's way of thinking,
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.280]   we will never be like I've been saying,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.920]   go where God is leading us to go
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.060]   and do what he's asking us to do.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.520]   So the question we have to ask ourselves today
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.960]   is this, church.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.880]   Are we open to changing our thinking?
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.420]   Are we open to changing our traditions
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.960]   whenever God challenges them?
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.960]   Now, this is a huge challenge,
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.880]   because most of us are comfortable with the way we think.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.880]   Most of all, are comfortable with the,
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.160]   we think we're right all the time.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.600]   For example, you know, after I got married,
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   did you realize that there is a correct way?
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.720]   I didn't think there was a correct way
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.760]   to put milk in the fridge, but apparently there is, okay?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.640]   I didn't think there was a correct way to fold towels
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.280]   that stack up in the bathroom a certain way,
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.800]   but there is, guys, okay?
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.180]   No, I didn't, okay?
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.360]   But we develop these mindsets, right?
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.520]   We take, so ingrained in these traditions,
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.320]   we get rooted into habits.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.080]   We become stubborn, and that becomes hard to change,
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.240]   especially maybe some of these things
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.040]   have offered us comfort and guidance in the past.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.880]   We want to hold onto them so that we feel protected
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.240]   as we go into the future.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   But we've been saying, right, as we go into the future,
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.120]   we don't know what's going on.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.440]   We don't know where God is leading us to go.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.600]   So if we hold onto those things,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.460]   we don't know if they're actually gonna be useful or not.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.120]   And today, we're gonna be looking at a passage in Scripture
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.600]   and through looking at this story,
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.180]   I hope we can see that God, we realize that God
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.160]   is a God who's not afraid to challenge the way we think,
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.680]   to help us to break free from the things that hold us back,
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.780]   even if some of those things
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.360]   might have been good at one stage.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.360]   If it's not fit for purpose now,
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.140]   God is challenging us to change the way we think
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.620]   so we can be the people he's called us to be.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.340]   So let's open up God's word.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.960]   You can listen to me or you can read on the screen
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.360]   or if you have your Bible, open that up.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.160]   Acts chapter 10 is where we're gonna be.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.000]   At Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.680]   a centurion in what was known as the Italian regiment.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.880]   He and all his family were devout and God-fearing.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.840]   He gave generously to those in need
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.580]   and prayed to God regularly.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.800]   One day, at about three in the afternoon, he had a vision.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.080]   He distinctly saw an angel of God who came to him
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.840]   and said, "Cornelius!"
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.800]   Cornelius stared at him in fear.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.880]   "What is it, Lord?" he asked.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.920]   The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.080]   "have come up as a memorial offering before God.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.980]   "Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.560]   "who is called Peter.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.620]   "He's staying with Simon the Tanner
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.960]   "whose house is by the sea."
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.400]   Now right away, I think what Luke's trying to do
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.040]   is get us to shift and change.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.920]   He's challenging us to look at certain things
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.560]   with a different perspective.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.320]   Let me explain what I mean.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.560]   At this time, Israel was still under Roman rule
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.880]   and authority.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.720]   And one of the things that Romans were most proud of,
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.400]   they were ruling over Israel at the time,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.000]   they were the main authority,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.080]   and one of the things that they were most proud of
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.560]   was their strong military power, their army.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.600]   Now Cornelius was a big part of that army,
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.000]   a centurion in a very important city.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.160]   So as a man, as a centurion in a place,
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.120]   accessaria, with an important port city,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.280]   he had a good amount of influence, a powerful leader,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.080]   and centurion means he had 100 soldiers under his control.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.760]   And so we would expect him to fit the stereotypes
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.700]   of a Roman officer.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.640]   And what were those?
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.160]   Well, they were known as being brutish and cruel,
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.560]   people who wouldn't hesitate to throw you in prison
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.800]   at the drop of a hat, to have you tortured,
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.160]   or even to have you killed if they didn't like
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.320]   the way you were doing something.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.860]   As Romans, they would have worshipped pagan gods,
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.200]   other gods, not Yahweh, but their own gods
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.920]   and their own religion.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.340]   So that would be the way that people would think
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:09.080]   about a Roman soldier or a centurion,
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.000]   someone in authority who is part of the Roman Empire.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.580]   But this isn't what Cornelius is like at all.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.360]   Instead, we are told that he is a God-fearing man,
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.940]   devout, he's generous to the poor,
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.640]   and very strikingly, they say he is a man of prayer.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.240]   He prays to God.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.100]   So what Luke is trying to do through this story
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.200]   is to help us open our eyes and open up our thinking
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.720]   a little bit, because it would be easy
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.520]   to have written Cornelius off and say to ourselves,
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.200]   there is no way a man could ever use,
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.680]   a god could ever use a man like that.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.360]   A Roman soldier, an idol worshiper,
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.600]   he's cruel, he's unsympathetic,
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.560]   but what God is trying to say,
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.120]   I can use anybody I choose to use.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.240]   One thing to remember is this,
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.400]   we are not told how Cornelius actually came
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.120]   to know who God was and to be so generous,
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.940]   to be so devoted to prayer.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.840]   I don't think it would be too much of a reach, though,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.400]   to sort of think that actually,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.640]   Cornelius, too, had to go through a process
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.600]   of changing his mind, knowing his background,
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.680]   knowing the way he was raised,
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.160]   he was probably raised in a home
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.940]   that did not worship God, that was cruel,
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.480]   that was brutish, embracing all those stereotypes
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.360]   that he grew up with.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.360]   At some point, he had to change his mind,
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.960]   saying I'm not gonna be like that,
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.100]   I'm not gonna be cruel, I'm not gonna be mean to people,
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.440]   actually, I'm gonna be generous, I'm gonna pray to God.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.240]   He had a fundamental shift in the way he thought
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.960]   and in his beliefs.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.520]   He had to make the big decision of pledging himself
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.560]   not to Caesar, right, that's how the Romans were prayed to,
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.320]   pray to Caesar, but to pray to Yahweh instead.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.200]   You see, what God was doing,
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.040]   God had amazing plans for Cornelius.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.720]   There was something he was trying to do through Cornelius,
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.640]   but first, he had to challenge Cornelius
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.820]   in his way of thinking.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.480]   Now, as I was reading this, I felt like this was a word
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.080]   in season for us, in the way we look at our leaders
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.680]   here in Hong Kong, hear me out.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.560]   Over the past few years, it's no secret
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.760]   that we have struggled at times,
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.360]   there's been a struggle between the city's leaders
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.200]   and the citizens, right, and perhaps certain decisions
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.160]   that have been made, right, it's easy to look at those
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.280]   in governing powers over us, to look at authority figures
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.040]   and think of them negatively, straight away, right,
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.880]   believing that they're all unkind,
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.000]   that they do not care about their citizens,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.840]   that they're their own agenda in minds.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.080]   But actually, I would say this is probably
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.240]   not just a Hong Kong problem, but all over the world,
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.800]   right, it's easy for us now to look at our earthly
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.520]   authority figures, people in government,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.320]   people in authority over us, through a lens of disdain,
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.540]   much like a first century Jew might have looked
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.000]   at a Roman soldier, an officer, seeing them as cruel,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.280]   barbaric, and unsympathetic, and because we think
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.720]   these things about them, we feel like we can't trust them,
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.280]   and we feel like we don't want to follow them,
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.500]   we think they're cruel and unkind.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.960]   We don't want anything to do with them.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.840]   But I felt like when I was reading this,
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.240]   God was challenging us to shift our perspective,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   especially to those who govern over us.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.640]   Because what if, and not even what if,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.360]   I believe, actually, that God is calling us
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.920]   to truly pray for those in authority over us.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.320]   And for some of us, this is gonna take a big shift
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.680]   in our thinking, and a big shift in the way
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.820]   we believe things.
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.080]   But I think this, because as we pray for our leaders,
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.480]   as God has commanded us to do in scripture,
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.720]   perhaps God is also, at the same time,
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.100]   doing the work of raising up leaders, people in authority,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.500]   right, authority figures, changing their hearts,
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.300]   changing their minds, like he might have done
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.360]   with Cornelius, who will then go on to live,
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.600]   to govern, to serve society in the way
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.000]   that God has called them to serve.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.040]   And then we'll start to see the change
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.560]   that we've been all hoping to see.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.320]   You see what I'm trying to say?
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.040]   So church, are we willing to change the way
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.960]   we think about leaders and those in authority over us?
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.520]   Are we willing to think and break out of those peoples
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.400]   that we've stereotyped as certain things,
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.880]   so that we can join in with God,
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.200]   and want the best for their lives, and pray for them,
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.320]   and as God changes and moves people
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.960]   in ways that we don't even understand how,
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.840]   we get to partner with God in shaping
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.080]   and providing hope for this world.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.040]   So with this new way of thinking, Cornelius,
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.440]   like we say, these suddenly and immediate leaders,
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.160]   Cornelius suddenly receives a message from God,
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.520]   and immediately, he responds obediently
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.680]   to this mysterious message, right?
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.400]   Go to Joppa, find Peter, bring him back to me.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.200]   And Cornelius responds immediately in obedience.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.480]   It says this, Cornelius called two of his servants
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.360]   and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants, right?
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.960]   So three dudes, he says, he told them everything
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.520]   that happened and sent them to Joppa.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.480]   Now at this moment, you have to realize,
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.560]   Cornelius has no clue what was going on.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.600]   He's received a vision, an angel has come to talk to him.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.440]   He's wondering, like, what is this all about?
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.000]   Who is this Simon Peter guy, right?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.440]   Why is he at Simon the tennis house?
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.200]   Why is the name Simon so popular in this area, right?
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.120]   Why does God want him to bring me back here?
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.080]   There's no answers yet,
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.880]   but what we can see is faith and obedience.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.720]   And as God shifts our thinking,
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.580]   we also have to ask ourselves these questions.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.900]   Once he does that, are we willing to be obedient
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.820]   even when things aren't clear for us?
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.580]   Are we willing to do what God calls us to do
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.140]   even when we haven't seen the whole picture yet?
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.100]   Andrew talked a bit about this last week,
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.500]   but obedience is easy when we understand.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:27.180]   True obedience though, is when we don't see it all,
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.340]   yet we are still willing to do it anyway.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.540]   This is what it means to take a risk,
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.820]   to not rely on a strategy, to have total surrender to God,
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.740]   but it has to start with the way we think.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.620]   Because most of us, like a plan of action,
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.060]   even myself, right, most of the time I'm flying
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.260]   by the seats of my pants, right, whatever you say,
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.100]   but, okay, even for myself,
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.460]   at least some guardrails are comforting sometimes.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.740]   But are we willing, right, to break of our comfort zones
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.180]   of knowing every single step
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.880]   and to simply let God lead the way and have his way?
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.900]   And when we do this, church,
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.820]   we see amazing things begin to happen.
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.220]   Okay, check it out, this is what happens next.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.660]   About noon the following day,
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.700]   they were on their journey and approaching the city.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.940]   Peter went up on the roof to pray.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.220]   He became hungry and wanted something to eat.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.980]   And while the meal was still being prepared,
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.580]   he fell into a trance.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.340]   He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheep
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.440]   being let down to earth by its four corners.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.060]   It contained all kinds of four-footed animals
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.020]   as well as reptiles and birds.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:46.060]   And a voice told him, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat."
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.980]   "Surely not, Lord," Peter replied.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.620]   "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.120]   The voice spoke to him a second time,
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.460]   "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.580]   This happened three times.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.300]   And immediately the sheep was taken back to heaven.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.500]   So the story is beginning to emerge.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.200]   Right now it's Peter's turn to have a supernatural encounter,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.500]   to have a vision from heaven.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.460]   Right, and in his vision, we see, right, a sheep,
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.500]   something like a sheep is filled with all kinds of animals
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.460]   and he's commanded to get up, kill and eat.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.580]   Now, in our Chinese context, this sounds like a jackpot,
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.920]   right, like good porn toy, right, this is like a buffet.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.400]   Right, as a Chinese person, it's kind of hard sometimes
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.140]   to imagine things we can and cannot eat, okay.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.820]   So if we were to see a vision like this, right,
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.800]   God says, "Come on, kill and eat," right,
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.700]   it's like an invitation to a buffet.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.640]   "Let's do it, come on, I'm excited.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.660]   "I can eat anything I want," right,
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.160]   that's like the best deal ever, right.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.900]   But Peter is not excited, right.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.520]   He doesn't wanna go anywhere near that stuff.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.920]   In fact, he almost sounds insulted
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.060]   that Jesus would ask him to do such a thing
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.940]   in the first place, right.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.560]   Jesus was asking Peter, essentially,
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.040]   to break the food doors.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.100]   All kinds of unclean animals that Jews were forbidden
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.940]   to eat were filled up in the sheet.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.640]   Peter's like, "I've never touched those things, right,
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.920]   "from since I was a baby, I've been observing these laws,
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.600]   "right, these laws that have been passed down
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.260]   "from generation to generation since we've been freed
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.620]   "from slavery in Egypt up 'til now.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.540]   "My parents, my grandparents, my great-grandparents,
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.260]   "we have all followed these laws.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.900]   "Things have always been this way,"
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.400]   which is why Peter says, "Surely not, Lord.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.540]   "I have never eaten anything unclean."
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.660]   And you have to realize that actually,
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.540]   this wasn't just about food laws, right,
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.980]   this was about identity.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.800]   It was a matter of holiness, right?
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.380]   The food laws were part of the laws
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.180]   that set the nation of Israel apart from other nations,
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.980]   right, from Jews, from Gentiles.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.520]   Gentiles means anyone who's not a Jew, right?
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.280]   So this is what it did for them, right,
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.280]   to set them apart, to keep them holy,
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.320]   to keep them protected from other nations.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.780]   And Jews would look at all these unclean foods
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.620]   that the Gentiles would eat and would label them
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.460]   as evil and wicked for these unclean things
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.020]   that Gentiles would do.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.060]   Us, as Jewish people, we don't do those things.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.100]   And so when Peter says, "No, I'm not gonna do that,"
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.740]   you can sort of sympathize him a little bit, right,
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.080]   at first, to why he had that sort of reaction.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.980]   Like I said, his whole life,
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.620]   this was ingrained to his beliefs,
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.000]   the importance of keeping up levitical law,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.820]   certain rules, certain things, right,
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.460]   certain, and it wasn't just food laws as a whole,
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.460]   but 617 laws that they had to follow.
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.200]   It was part of their identity.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.260]   Right, in fact, the food laws were particularly important,
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.700]   that they were revered in a way,
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.620]   some of the heroes of the Old Testament faith.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.820]   Remember David and his three friends, right?
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.620]   They refused to eat the king's food,
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.340]   and in the end, they were commended
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.360]   as people who truly followed God,
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.740]   and God blessed them in a certain way.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.220]   They were rescued by God
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.420]   precisely because they didn't break the food laws.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.140]   So Peter was thinking, "I'm set.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.060]   "These are things that can never be done.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.200]   "Certain foods are prohibited by God.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.140]   "I'm never gonna break that law."
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.940]   And for a time, like I said,
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.880]   that was needed, and it was right.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.220]   But now what God was doing through this vision, right,
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.980]   even though Peter doesn't quite see it yet,
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.780]   he makes clear that there is now no distinction
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.140]   between Jews and Gentiles.
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.100]   God is using this picture of unclean food now made clean
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.060]   to pertain that the Gentiles too
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.100]   are included in God's plan.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.420]   They've always been, right,
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.660]   that they're included in God's plan,
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.820]   that the Gentiles have been made clean.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.740]   And so what this means now is for you yourself, Peter,
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.840]   as a Jewish person, you can now go and fellowship
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.420]   and do life and minister to these people.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.420]   In fact, that's what I'm gonna call you to do.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.660]   I am welcoming them fully into this family of God, Peter,
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.260]   and so should you.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.660]   So Peter, put out your old way of thinking
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.280]   and be a part of what I'm trying to do now.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.960]   This is what God is trying to say.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.380]   In fact, he says it very clearly.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.380]   "Do not call anything impure that God has made unclean."
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.140]   Like I said, it's more than just about food laws.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.100]   It's not just saying to Peter,
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.140]   "Hey, go and eat tau siu fan right now, okay?"
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.860]   It's more than that.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.340]   One level, yes, dig in, but like I said,
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.020]   he's trying to say there are no lines of boundaries now
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.220]   that once separated from you and the others.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.700]   Jesus is drawing Jew and Gentile together,
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.060]   not moving past one to get to the other,
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.380]   not choosing one and rejecting the other,
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.140]   but bringing them together to draw close
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.420]   what was once far apart.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:08.760]   When I was studying this, I may think, what about us?
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.060]   What are some ways in our society
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.820]   and these traditional ways of thinking
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.780]   that we have labeled other people as unclean
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.620]   and rejected them?
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.340]   What are some lines and boundaries within our own culture
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.980]   that we need to begin and start changing our thinking on?
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.220]   In many ways, what God was challenging Peter to do,
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.080]   similar what we're facing in Hong Kong today.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.420]   Like Peter, for those of us who grew up in Hong Kong,
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.060]   we've grown up in sort of like a colonized environment,
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.820]   meaning we've always been under the rule
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.940]   of some sort of foreign power.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.580]   But now that we're no longer accordingly,
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.100]   we've returned to our home country for some time now,
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.300]   but because we've been separated for so long,
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.820]   we don't really feel that connected as Hong Kongers
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.460]   to our roots and our origins.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.900]   So we find ourselves, I feel like,
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.200]   in a bit of an identity crisis.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.780]   We're not British enough to be British,
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.100]   we're not Chinese enough to be Chinese,
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.220]   so we have Hong Kong culture.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.680]   And so as Hong Kongers, we're proud of this in many ways.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.860]   I am so proud to be from this city,
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.580]   and it's such a beautiful thing.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:20.240]   We have a rich diversity here in Hong Kong, don't we?
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.740]   Melting pot from people from all over the world.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:27.020]   We can even see that reflected in this very room itself.
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.540]   But we've got Cantonese language,
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.920]   colorful, very descriptive.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.900]   You could ask for a spoon and end up with a fork.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.060]   Get one tone wrong, and it completely changes
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.060]   what you're trying to say.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.140]   We have amazing food, vibrant, delicious,
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.220]   fusion foods from all over the world.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.540]   You can have an amazing meal for $45,
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.540]   or you can have a good meal for $4,500.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.160]   Either one, it's amazing and delicious, it's in own way.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.380]   At the same time, though,
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.720]   because I feel like we have these struggles with identity,
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.160]   we've developed these sort of defense mechanisms,
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.000]   these barriers, these ways of thinking that we've put up
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.440]   that separates us from others.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.880]   And these have developed into some unhealthy
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.880]   and prejudiced ways of thinking
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.780]   that we might view people in our city.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.040]   So for example, when we encounter someone from the mainland
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.300]   as a Hong Konger, maybe one of our natural instincts
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:30.200]   is to think, oh, well, they're not really like us.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.380]   We might look similar,
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.260]   but they don't really share in our culture.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.460]   They don't really, you know, we speak a similar language,
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.900]   but it's quite different enough for us
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.740]   not to be able to understand each other,
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.100]   so we're not gonna engage with them.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.720]   What about our foreign domestic workers?
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.600]   Well, these people might live alongside us,
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.200]   but really, they're just a worker in our homes.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.420]   Right, we're the busy, successful Hong Kongers
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.080]   going about making money.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.680]   We don't need to really engage with them.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.600]   Right, and sometimes we don't even think of them
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.420]   and treat of them as members of society, right,
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.800]   since the pattern of thinking we've developed,
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.440]   their role is just to serve,
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.720]   and we fail to truly love, respect, and honor
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.040]   our foreign domestic workers, our helpers, and aunties
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.680]   who support our families so well.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.360]   What about our other ethnic minorities
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.400]   that live in this city?
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.280]   Right, they too eat differently, dress differently,
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.740]   have languages that we don't understand.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.080]   Again, but they haven't grown up here.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.520]   But they're not really Hong Kongers,
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.260]   so let's keep them at arm's length as well.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.760]   Now, we're in Hong Kong, I'm a Hong Konger,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.780]   we're speaking in a very Hong Kong context,
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.360]   but if you're listening today and you're not from here,
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.760]   or you're listening from somewhere else,
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.820]   the idea is the same, right?
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.500]   You see what I'm trying to say?
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.760]   In your own context, in your own culture,
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.120]   what are these barriers that you've set up?
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.900]   What are these faulty ways of thinking
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.280]   that you've developed about other people,
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.280]   other cultures that are not like you?
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.100]   Well, what about when it comes to even in this gathering,
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.880]   our own church itself?
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.220]   Right, do we label people with certain sin struggles
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.840]   to be more unclean?
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.140]   Do we take a holier-than-thou approach
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.500]   to people struggling with certain sins?
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.300]   Do the barriers that we see in culture
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.660]   seep into our faith gatherings,
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.300]   so on the surface here, it might seem like
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.800]   everyone's getting along, raising their hands in worship,
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.020]   getting along, praising God together,
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.460]   but deep down, I would never go to this person's house.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.300]   No way.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.540]   That true connection is not there.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:44.160]   These barriers break God's heart.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.720]   It's certainly not how he thinks about things.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.800]   And as we hold onto these old ways of thinking,
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.560]   we hold onto our prejudice,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.440]   we are calling impure by our own judgment
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.600]   what God has already made clean.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.620]   What are we refusing to change, church?
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.500]   But we know God has, deep down,
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.200]   we know that God has called us to change.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.260]   These are the ways of thinking
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.940]   that God is challenging us in.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.420]   And it's a beautiful thing
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.260]   when Peter realizes what's happening.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.340]   When Peter realizes what Jesus is asking him to do,
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.000]   it's like a eureka, a ding, ding, ding sort of moment
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.840]   in his life, right?
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.420]   Listen to these words.
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.940]   I now realize how true it is
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.380]   that God chose not favoritism, listen,
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.860]   but accepts every nation who fears him
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.140]   and does what is right.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.220]   You have to understand Peter's mindset from before.
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.820]   He became a man from so adamant, right,
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.620]   about not ever, he was a very stubborn man
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.020]   to changing his thinking
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.820]   into what God has been asking him to embrace.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.780]   This is the beautiful thing
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.380]   about letting God do the thinking instead of us,
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.340]   because he's infinitely wiser,
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:05.340]   his perspective is infinitely wider than any of us.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.540]   We find out, actually, this is what God has been working
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.140]   at the whole time, even though we don't know it.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:14.100]   It took them to respond in change of thinking
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:14.940]   and their obedience.
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.120]   Now they see it, right?
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.340]   Last week, we realized that Peter
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.420]   and the Ethiopian eunuch wasn't a coincidence
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.260]   that they got together,
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.660]   but it was the Holy Spirit who was orchestrating.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.980]   God was orchestrating the whole thing, right?
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.180]   Later on in the story of Acts,
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.620]   we have Saul and Ananias,
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.980]   two people that should never have been together,
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.100]   but God brings them together.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.100]   And now we have Cornelius and Peter,
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.460]   two men who are willing to change the way they think,
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.640]   respond in obedience to God,
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.300]   and now God's gonna use them in a remarkable way.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.900]   Like I said, the transformation that Peter has gone through
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.940]   is actually pretty remarkable,
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.160]   'cause Peter was always a person who thought he knew best.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.380]   Last week, we figured out, right,
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.260]   Peter was the one who thought he knew better than Jesus,
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.340]   that planned for Jesus' life,
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.500]   until Jesus rebuked him to his face.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.660]   Peter was, he thought that violence was the best way
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.460]   to stop the soldiers from worshiping Jesus.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.300]   So what did he do?
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.460]   He took things into his own hand.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.980]   When the soldiers were coming to arrest Jesus,
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.620]   he pulls out his sword, tries to cut the guy's head off,
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.740]   and said, "Just get his ear," right?
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.020]   He thought that was the right thing to do.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.500]   But God told Jesus, says, "Not this way, Peter."
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.180]   Peter was so stubborn in his thinking,
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.020]   "I'm gonna be loyal to Jesus,
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.340]   "and even if it costs me my life,"
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:38.300]   only to deny his best friend hours after that.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.500]   So Peter has gone through this journey
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.980]   in the way he was thinking,
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.300]   but there's one particular moment,
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.380]   you know, as I was reading this passage and thinking back,
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.260]   that I felt like Peter was probably thinking about
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.660]   when he came across this thought.
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.180]   Matthew 16, 19 tells us,
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.460]   when Jesus is having this conversation with Peter,
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:03.780]   he once said to Peter, "The keys to the kingdom of heaven
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.500]   "have been given to you."
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.580]   And I really wonder if Peter was thinking
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.420]   about that conversation when he realizes
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.460]   what's happening in this moment.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.580]   It's God was saying, "Remember, Peter,
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.340]   "I gave you the keys.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.380]   "You are the gatekeeper in this moment
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.780]   "of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.380]   "I want you to take those keys, Peter.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.180]   "I want you to open the gates and throw them wide open,
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.940]   "and now your job is to tell the whole world,
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.140]   "everyone who loves me is welcome in.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.260]   "Doesn't matter if you're Jew,
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.780]   "doesn't matter if you're Gentile.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.860]   "Open those gates, Peter, you have the key.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.340]   "Your job is to tell the world who I am,
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.020]   "and let everybody into my kingdom."
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:44.740]   This is the new way of thinking that I'm challenging you with
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.580]   not just to the Jewish nation, but to everyone.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.260]   And this is what Peter's life's changed.
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.460]   We see him launching into this mission,
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.060]   and he goes and he starts spreading the gospel.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.700]   He starts with Cornelius and his family.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.740]   He starts sharing with them the gospel,
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.380]   telling them who Jesus is.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.820]   Even though they love God, they haven't yet met Jesus,
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.300]   and so in this moment, Peter shares the gospel
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.580]   with Cornelius, his family.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.980]   He starts to tell them about his death and his resurrection,
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:17.340]   the forgiveness of sins that come through believing in him.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.060]   And Peter has fully embraced his thinking
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.380]   that everyone who gives their life to Jesus
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.380]   is welcome into his kingdom.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.620]   All the barriers now, the very fact that he's in Cornelius'
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.700]   house itself already means that his thinking
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.100]   has been changed.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.780]   But this is the most amazing thing.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.380]   An astonishing thing happens here.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.820]   Peter didn't even get to finish his message,
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.980]   because at that moment, the Holy Spirit falls.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.460]   And Cornelius and his family begin speaking his tongues,
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.860]   and they're baptized fully into God's family.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.700]   But we saw this happening earlier, actually,
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.860]   in the book of Acts, on the day of Pentecost,
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.220]   when the disciples themselves were filled
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.740]   with the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.820]   Now it's the Gentiles' turn, the non-Jewish family's turn,
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.380]   to receive the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.300]   This is God's final confirmation of the picture.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.260]   This is truly what I'm trying to do.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.620]   Everyone now is welcome into the kingdom of God.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.900]   This is for real.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:22.900]   All this was possible,
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.180]   because Peter was willing to think differently.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.500]   He was willing to put down his traditions, his culture,
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:34.500]   so he could respond to what God was calling him to do.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.700]   He could have been stubborn.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.740]   He could have been stuck in his ways.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.900]   When he saw that sheet, he said, "I'm not gonna do that.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.100]   "I'm gonna keep to my lane.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.100]   "I'm gonna stay what I'm doing.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.180]   "You go find someone else to do this."
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.540]   But notice, that's not what happens.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:54.500]   He responds by changing his thinking in obedience to God.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:59.460]   Notice, this is always about God's work.
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.140]   It's not that Peter changed his thoughts
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.100]   in somehow orchestrated events.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:03.940]   It's not that he saw,
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.860]   it wasn't just a random vision in the sky
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.780]   that he responded to it.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.820]   This was God challenging him to his way of thinking
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.780]   into ways he never thought about himself,
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.740]   but responding in obedience
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.300]   to what God was calling him to do now.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.900]   And as we look, this is very typical
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.540]   of the way God works across the Bible,
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.460]   helping people change their perspective,
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:24.540]   change their thinking,
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.700]   so he can respond in obedience to him,
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.500]   and then they can do what he's called them to do.
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.380]   For example, Moses.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.260]   Moses always thought he wasn't a good speaker.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:40.260]   I don't have the words, I'm not a good speaker, Lord,
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.140]   but God used him to speak to Pharaoh
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.220]   and set his people free from slavery.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.340]   Gideon thought to himself,
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.140]   I'm the smallest dude from the smallest tribe,
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:55.140]   the big army before me, how can I ever defeat them?
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.700]   God shifts his perspective, changes thinking,
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:02.220]   and with just 300 men, Gideon defeats the enemy army.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.940]   The woman at the well thought Jesus was there to condemn her
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.940]   just like everybody else.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.540]   She thought, I'm no longer worthy of society,
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.660]   I have to come out here in the heat of the day
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.820]   just to get some water, I have no place in society anymore.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.540]   But as she encounters Jesus, her perspective changes,
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.980]   and she goes back and evangelizes
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.900]   the entire region of Samaria.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:31.540]   You see how now it's not our role to think up strategies,
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.620]   to come up with ideas, to come up with plans,
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.940]   to figure things out, God has already done that for us.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.780]   All he asks us to do is shift the way we think
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.260]   so that we can walk in obedience
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.660]   and then he can use us to do the things
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.500]   that he has called us to do.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:50.860]   It's all about being obedient to Christ.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:55.100]   So let me give us a few guidelines from scripture
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.260]   as to how we can switch our minds
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.140]   so we can be more obedient to the things
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.220]   God is calling us to.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.540]   Number one, 1 Corinthians 2, 16,
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.380]   scripture tells us to do this,
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.380]   to put on the mind of Christ.
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.180]   This means that we don't think like the world thinks,
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.100]   but rather we put on the mind of Christ,
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.620]   we're saying that we think like Jesus would think.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:22.940]   We approach things from a godly perspective, right?
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.900]   We set our minds on the things that are what?
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.740]   Above.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.260]   And as we do this, scripture tells us
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.460]   we can't do this by our own experience.
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.180]   We lean not on our own, what church?
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.180]   Understanding.
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:39.860]   But submit all our ways to him, that's Proverbs 3.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.980]   We embrace the wisdom of God,
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.500]   we trust that God's way are not our ways,
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.580]   his thoughts are what?
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.740]   Higher than our thoughts, Isaiah 55.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.980]   You see, if we do things,
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.660]   if we keep just thinking in our own ways
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.140]   and doing things our own ways,
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.740]   we're only ever gonna get earthly results.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.180]   But when we shift our thinking
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.060]   and respond in obedience to God,
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:07.060]   we get godly, heavenly, supernatural results.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.940]   We do not conform to the pattern of this world
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.940]   that the Bible tells us, but our minds are transformed,
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.580]   we are transformed by the renewing of our minds.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.660]   Then we will be able to test and approve what God's will is,
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.860]   his good, pleasing, and perfect will, right?
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.740]   To obey him, to walk in the way he wants us to walk,
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.260]   Romans 12.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.580]   We take every top cap to the make it what?
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.980]   Obedient to Christ.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.740]   This is what I mean when we say
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.780]   we need to change the way we think, right?
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.060]   It's not about mustering up more willpower,
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.060]   it's not about manifesting, okay,
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.300]   don't come at me with that, okay, into reality.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.020]   It's not about setting a more positive mindset even,
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.060]   it's about changing your thinking
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.060]   so you can be obedient to God
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.940]   and walk in the way that he's called you to walk.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.900]   This is what it means to change our thinking.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:03.420]   And when we do this,
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:10.140]   when we do this, the world truly begins to change.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.540]   When we have a church that's filled with people
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.260]   who are thinking right, guided by God's wisdom,
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.700]   obedient to what Jesus has called us to do,
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.700]   empowered by the Holy Spirit,
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.380]   boldly going into these uncharted areas
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.860]   that we've been challenged to go,
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.420]   the places in our community,
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.500]   we bring down the strongholds
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.740]   that have been taking other people captive.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.380]   We can say amen to that, yes?
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.540]   Imagine what it would be like.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.820]   Our city is so stuck in the ways of thinking,
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.020]   some of the things that we see in our society
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.220]   that we've sort of given up on.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.340]   But if we go together,
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.260]   if we're obedient to what Jesus has called us to do,
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.300]   and we start to bring a new perspective
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.700]   to some of these strongholds,
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.100]   think what would happen.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.740]   So the thought in the city that money is more important
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.620]   than everything else,
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.980]   from God's perspective that looks like,
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.820]   you know what, I'm gonna teach people
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:06.180]   and teach myself to put God first.
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:10.580]   Right, the thought that you need to be a certain position
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.700]   to be considered somebody becomes God loves you
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.660]   and values you and cherishes you unconditionally
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.060]   no matter who you are.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.220]   This thought that we need to put this immense pressure
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.380]   on our kids to be high achievers
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.220]   and have all these academic achievements
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.340]   becomes Jesus wants you just to have childlike faith.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:34.260]   The thought that this city can never be evangelized
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.820]   because people are too busy chasing the Hong Kong dream
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.460]   becomes with God all things are possible.
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.180]   The idea that separation and separation is a reality
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.500]   that people will never be truly united
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.540]   becomes in Christ there is slave nor free,
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.060]   Jew nor Gentile, male or female.
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.180]   This pandemic that we see with our young people
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.620]   giving up hope, turning to drugs and suicide, right,
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.820]   the generations of Hong Kong have no hope
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.580]   becomes you, oh Lord, are my hope and my salvation.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.140]   The thought that the idols of the city
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.380]   will always have a foothold,
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.420]   that will never break free from the things
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.540]   that hold us back from really following God
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.980]   become Jesus is the way, the truth, and the?
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.900]   The idea that there's families,
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.900]   there's children out there that need families
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.020]   out there right now, foster care and adoption,
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.980]   and that they will always be stuck in this situation,
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.900]   that generations upon generations of fatherlessness,
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.180]   of parentlessness becomes look after the widows
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.980]   and the orphans, and a group of Christians
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.580]   will rise up to that challenge,
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.540]   and every single child can be placed
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.300]   into a home that loves them.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.460]   Come on, church.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:45.300]   Let's not sit back and be defeated by our thoughts.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.980]   That's what the enemy's trying to do,
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.620]   is to try to confuse our way we think,
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.540]   but this is a call to rise up,
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.820]   change our thinking, change our perspective,
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.860]   ask God to give us a new mind and a new heart
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.740]   so we can walk in obedience to him,
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.780]   and be the people he's called to be,
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.660]   do the things that he's called us to do,
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:06.020]   defeat and claim back some of these uncharted areas
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.500]   that the enemy has taken for the glory of God.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.540]   This is how we bring the light of the gospel into the city.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.980]   Jesus had made all things clean.
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:19.540]   Our job now is to bring things back into his presence.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.140]   Do the work of reclaiming city in the name of Jesus,
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:26.020]   and it starts with the way we think, church.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:31.740]   So let us give it a moment.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:37.260]   Close your eyes right now for a second, if you would.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.420]   (silence)
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:53.660]   I understand that it is a process,
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.140]   and trust me when I say I've been there.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.340]   Some of these old thoughts keep popping up in our minds,
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:03.700]   and it's hard to break free from our negative thoughts
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.180]   and the way we think about things.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.820]   It's hard to break free from some of these traditions
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.820]   that we hold on so strongly to.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:24.900]   But as you sit there at the moment,
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.940]   just allow the Holy Spirit to bring those things up to you.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.460]   What are some of these faulty ways of thinking
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.660]   that you've embraced,
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.020]   and what are some of these faulty ways of thinking
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.620]   that have been holding you back
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:44.860]   from being obedient to Jesus,
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.700]   to do what he's called you to do?
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:52.940]   For some of us, those things might be rooted
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.620]   in trauma and abuse and pain.
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.380]   And our prayer there is that you would find the help you need,
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.380]   that Jesus would set you free from those experiences,
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:19.780]   and so that you know that you are safe in Jesus' hands,
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.580]   that he will never lead you anywhere
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:26.060]   that is gonna be harmful for you as a person,
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.940]   but he has the best plan for you.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:36.060]   Maybe for some of us, we feel like we're useless.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.900]   That's a thought that's been ingrained in our mind.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.780]   "Ah, it's no use."
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:48.580]   "I'll never amount to anything anyway,
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:49.620]   so what's the point in trying?"
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:55.020]   And to you, I feel like the Holy Spirit would say,
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:46:00.860]   "I created you.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:06.700]   I created you for good works that only you can do,
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:11.020]   and you have a place, a task, a mission in my kingdom."
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:19.340]   For some of us, it might be traditions
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.540]   that from our family that have been passed down
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.860]   through generations like Peter.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.860]   Maybe saying yes to being obedient to Jesus
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.820]   might mean it seems like it's completely turning your back
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:35.260]   on everything you've known and to the beliefs of your family.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:41.700]   But look what happens in this story.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:46.020]   Cornelius' entire family was changed because of his faith.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.220]   And so I pray for courage for those in those areas,
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.620]   that you would have wisdom to know what it means
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:58.380]   to share your faith with your family.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.620]   And maybe through you, just as it happened
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:08.020]   to Cornelius' family, everybody would begin to praise God
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.020]   and be baptized, and the Holy Spirit would reign
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.180]   over you and your loved ones.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.860]   All I know is I don't know how God is exactly going to work.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.020]   This is what, you know, the amazing thing
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:26.220]   about the unchartedness of what we're going forth into,
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:30.980]   but I see in this room a group of people
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.180]   who are at least interested in coming on a Sunday
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.020]   and worshipping, and so you know something of who Jesus is.
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:40.500]   And you've heard a message like this today.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:46.460]   Maybe just your one prayers,
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.460]   "Okay, Lord, help me change my mind.
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.380]   "And whatever you want me to see,
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:57.020]   "however you want me to think, open my eyes to those things.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:02.860]   "And give me a heart that is obedient so I can walk in those."
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.380]   So I'm going to ask us if that is you,
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:10.420]   if you are willing to be challenged by Jesus
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.900]   in the way you think, to shift your perspective,
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.740]   for you to be challenged in the way you live,
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.980]   for your hearts to be made more obedient to Him.
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:25.220]   You can rise up to your feet at this moment,
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.540]   just as a prayer, as a response to what God is calling us to do.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:35.140]   If you're ready for that, just stand up.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.500]   That's all it takes, as a response.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.580]   And that's just you saying,
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.180]   "Jesus, I am willing to be obedient."
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.580]   And I see, I hear church rising to their feet now.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.180]   "So Lord, would you take our prayer,
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.580]   "would you take our hearts, would you take our minds?
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:56.780]   "We bring it all before you as a sacrifice.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.500]   "We ask you to shake up our thoughts,
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.380]   "shake up our religions, shake up our traditions.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:05.580]   "Give us the mind of Christ.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:09.580]   "Give us the mind of Jesus Christ.
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.580]   "Give us the mind of Christ.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.580]   "Give us the mind of Christ to be obedient,
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:17.980]   "to do whatever it is that you've called us to do.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:22.580]   "And in this, Lord, may we bring your kingdom
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.380]   "here on this earth.
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:28.380]   "May we show people the life there is in following you,
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:31.380]   "and allowing your love to guide everything that we do.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.180]   "We pray this in Jesus' name."
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.780]   (gentle music)
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.540]   (wind whooshing)
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:50.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
