[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience chattering)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.820]   Ah, great.
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.740]   Who has plans for summer?
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.180]   Anyone got summer plans?
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.560]   Only Tim and maybe me.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.780]   All right, yeah, my family, they're already in Singapore,
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.020]   but I love you guys too much,
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.900]   so I decided to stay with you all.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.700]   (laughs)
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.660]   I do love you guys.
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.860]   And I would love to tell you a few things
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.580]   that's happening in church as well.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.860]   So last week, just a praise report,
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.700]   we had our first ever Youth Ministry gathering last Sunday.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.340]   And it was so fun, thanks to a lot of our volunteers,
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.840]   and it's been a great time.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.980]   And we're gonna have the second one next week.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.720]   So next Sunday, is it next week?
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.220]   Yes, next Sunday at 1.30 to 3.30.
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.740]   And I just want to tell you in advance,
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.420]   especially to our young people here,
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.420]   we do actually prepare lunch for you all.
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.240]   So I know some of you, last time you came after lunch,
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.820]   and we're so sorry, we just hope you come and join us
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.780]   for lunch, I'm talking to the young people here,
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.020]   by the way, yeah.
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.140]   And youth, according to Francesca last week,
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.220]   the definition of youth in this church,
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.620]   I know we're all very young, when I look around,
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.220]   you all are so young and energetic.
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.220]   But youth in our church means people who are
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.460]   in the age range of 13 to 18.
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.660]   I hope I got this right, 13 to 18, all right?
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.460]   I know all the ladies in this room are 18,
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.100]   I know that, I know that, okay.
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100]   Maybe we have to set this a little bit lower then.
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.540]   Anyway, so if you have any young people around you,
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.780]   please scan this QR code, invite them,
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.700]   remind them we're providing lunch as well,
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.540]   so that's happening next week.
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.620]   And I'm gonna jump forward to September
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.100]   to tell you something exciting in advance.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.100]   Our next baptism is happening at the end of September.
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.260]   So this is the date we have set for now.
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.140]   We may change it a little bit,
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.780]   but it should be around this time.
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.300]   And the baptism class will be on the 8th and the 15th.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.700]   So we're telling you the dates in advance
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.260]   'cause we wanna invite especially those among us,
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.540]   if you have not been baptized, which we think you should be,
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.020]   because baptism audit means it's an outward symbol
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.180]   of something that is happening inside of you.
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.140]   If you follow Jesus in your heart,
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.740]   if you accept him as your Lord and Savior,
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.100]   then baptism is a way to tell the rest of the world,
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.700]   this is what you have chosen to do
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.380]   or to believe in your heart.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.500]   So of course, there's so much more about baptism
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.940]   and about like what's about following Jesus
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.340]   that we would love to explain to you in the baptism class.
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.260]   And even if you're not sure whether you could get baptized
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.340]   for whatever reasons,
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.700]   we still would love to invite you to the baptism class
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.300]   if you haven't joined one before.
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.260]   You will learn so much more about baptism
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.020]   and faith and everything, and you can decide.
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.300]   And we do have people in the past,
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.220]   even they couldn't join the baptism for whatever reason,
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.740]   they came to the baptism class
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.660]   and we had a great time together, I think.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.620]   So yeah, so sign up code here
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.060]   and we will keep reminding you
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.580]   so you have more time to think about it.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.060]   Cool, and the next announcements,
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.820]   I wanna invite someone, one of my heroes up on the stage.
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.380]   These are the heroes that's always like
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.900]   work in the background.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.580]   And can we give it up to Justin?
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.460]   He's gonna tell us a little bit about the production team.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.300]   - Joseph, Joseph, good morning.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.820]   If I'm one of your heroes, you need to look higher, man.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.700]   All right, get some better role models.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.820]   Yeah, I'm Justin,
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.020]   I'm in charge of the production team here at Vineyuan Long.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.340]   And I don't know, some of you might be like,
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.260]   what is production?
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260]   I know whenever I see the word producer,
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.420]   I'm like, that doesn't mean anything to me.
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.900]   It sounds vague and fancy.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.860]   So that's why we have a list here.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.580]   For production team, we're basically in charge
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.820]   of anything that's got electricity, a power cable,
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.940]   that's our job.
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.060]   So sound, slides, camera, lighting,
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.900]   everything that we need to make a service run smoothly
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.940]   and help you as a congregation,
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.900]   follow along with the scriptures or hear the sermon
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.940]   or watch it back on the recording.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.660]   That's what we do.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.420]   So we're always looking for more people
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.940]   to join the team and help.
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.020]   If any of that interests you
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.620]   and you feel relatively comfortable
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.980]   with technology in your life,
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.460]   please come talk to me or scan the code
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.580]   and you can fill out our interest form.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.460]   And one perk is that you get to hang out
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.340]   in the very cool, what Pastor Tim calls the VIP room.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.620]   It's a very cool vibe back there,
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.860]   especially if you're an introvert.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.260]   So come join us, but not too many of you
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.380]   'cause then that defeats the whole purpose.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.100]   But yeah, no, that's why we have scheduling.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.220]   All right, please, yeah, if you are interested,
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.060]   come talk to me.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.900]   Thank you very much.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.860]   - Thank you, Justin.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.700]   I remember there was one time
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.780]   I was preaching in the Cantonese service.
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.180]   I came in like before service, I guess 15 minutes,
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.220]   I have a very last minute request,
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.780]   a very high tech kind of last minute request.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.540]   And I talked to Justin and all he said was,
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.820]   "That's why we're here."
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.340]   I think sometimes we forget how much effort
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.220]   has been put into the service.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.020]   And I think if you really want to learn
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.740]   to serve like Jesus, like servant leadership,
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.340]   that's a fancy word, that is a very good place to start.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.180]   Can we put our hands together for our whole production team
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.220]   and also our welcome team as well.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.180]   They've been serving week in, week out
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.100]   and they've been amazing.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.660]   And talking about the welcome team,
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.620]   they're standing there ready for offering already.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.540]   So I'll just very spoofly
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.780]   segue into our offering time as well.
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.740]   And as a welcome team, they're passing on the buckets.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.780]   If you gift by cash or checks,
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.580]   that's how you can put it inside the buckets
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.980]   with the envelopes.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.900]   If you want to do it in all the digital fancy ways,
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.300]   all the QR codes are on the screen.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.940]   We just want to thank you for partnering with us
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.060]   in this church.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.060]   And you may be aware of the alphas that we've been running.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.020]   And alpha season will be back soon again.
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.900]   We'll tell you more about it later.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.540]   You may remember the parenting workshop seminars
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.740]   that we're hosting and all the other ministries.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.100]   We're very grateful that a lot of you,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.140]   you partner with us in many different ways.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.260]   First of all, of course, it's through your prayer.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.900]   And of course, a lot of you would come and volunteer
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.100]   in those events.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.380]   And also a lot of you give quite sacrificially
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.540]   to make all these possible.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.340]   We're still finding new ways to better serve
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.940]   our community here in Yuen Long.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.060]   That's why God planted us here.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.140]   We're still finding ways,
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.660]   but your partnership has always been crucial.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.940]   And I just want to say thank you to all of you for that.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.020]   And I would love to pray for our offering today as well.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.660]   Would you bow your heads with me?
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.060]   God, we thank you for your blessings,
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.220]   not just on us, but also through us.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.420]   We are amazed that as a group of people here,
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.500]   as your representative, your church,
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.340]   what we can actually do to bless those people around us,
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.140]   people who know you, people who have yet to know you.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.140]   Father, you have given us resources,
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.820]   you have given us talents,
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.220]   you have given us many different ways
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.460]   to reach out to those around us.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.780]   I pray that Lord God, that we will continue to journey
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.900]   with you, to walk with you as a church.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.660]   We will continue to bring your blessings
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.420]   to this community around us in Yuen Long and to our city.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.220]   And Father, I just want to thank you
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.820]   for every single one here in this room who give,
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.300]   who choose to partner, who choose to sow into your kingdom.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.860]   I pray a blessing over them and their family.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.820]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.700]   And I would love to invite our speaker today,
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.980]   Tim, back to the stage, Pastor Tim.
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.660]   It's good to have you with us today again.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.900]   And yeah, so let's pray for him
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.860]   as he's going to bring this message to us today.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.820]   Father, we pray for Pastor Tim,
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.860]   we pray you would anoint your servant,
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.660]   you would speak through him today.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.940]   We pray as he unpacks your work, your word,
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.140]   and God, we pray that our hearts will be set on fire
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.420]   by this message.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.020]   I know it has already set his heart on fire.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.020]   So God, we just pray today you will come
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.540]   and speak to every single one of us in this room.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.180]   In your name we pray.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.060]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.220]   - Thank you, Chapman.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.620]   Wow, it's so good to be with you, good to see you.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.900]   Amazing to worship with you together.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.420]   You know, the lyrics from the song,
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.380]   "You're Worthy of It All," like as Chapman did,
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.340]   you know, they're from the book of Revelations.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.820]   And one thing that John in that book does,
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.820]   he gives heavenly scenes to encourage the saints.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.780]   So there's, whenever the book of Revelation shifts,
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.180]   it's God revealing what's happening in the heavenly realm,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.220]   and he encourages and builds up his people.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.380]   And so I really, I don't know about you,
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.660]   but I was just so encouraged and built up,
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.900]   you know, through the worship,
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.160]   and I trust that you were as well.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.660]   But hey, now this year, here at the Vineyard Long,
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.940]   we have been focusing on growing
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.060]   in our personal relationship with Jesus.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.640]   One way that we have tried to do that
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.800]   is through the beginning of the year,
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.500]   we had a 21-day fasting season.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.200]   So during the fasting time, we came before God,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.500]   and we brought things where we were longing for breakthrough
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   where we said, "Jesus, I need breakthrough from you
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.780]   in this area of my life."
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.140]   But it was not the only thing
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.540]   that we brought before Jesus' fasting season.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.060]   It was also us making ourselves available.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.740]   "Jesus, I'm here, I'm available, use me, use our church.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.820]   We know that what you wanna do,
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.860]   we're not able to do out of our own strength,
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.060]   out of our own power, but it's by the power of your spirit."
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.700]   And it was a yielding and a surrendering.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.180]   And then with that fasting season
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.660]   that we had at the beginning of the year,
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.660]   21 days of fasting, we also had a sermon series
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.300]   that we titled "Fresh Encounters."
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.660]   And so part of that series was about that
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.260]   we as Christians, a lot of times,
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.380]   get into spiritual routines.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.820]   Now routine is nothing bad, actually they're very helpful,
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.300]   but sometimes our routines get stale,
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.700]   where we just do the same old, same old,
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.220]   and our spiritual life somehow loses its dynamic.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.060]   And so in the series, we were talking about
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.420]   how we wanna have fresh encounters with Jesus,
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.420]   how we wanna have new encounters,
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.540]   not just always talk about the past,
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.980]   but Jesus meeting us here in the present,
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.700]   speaking to us in the present,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.660]   doing new things in our lives.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.620]   So for those of you who were here
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.780]   at the beginning of the year, I'm just curious,
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.100]   how is that going?
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.580]   How has that been going?
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:23.300]   Now for me, one of the things that I do,
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.660]   one of my own spiritual practices,
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.660]   is I ask myself every week a series of questions
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.580]   that I then answer by journaling.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.140]   And so these are questions about my work,
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.460]   these are questions about my personal life,
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.100]   how I'm doing spiritually.
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.940]   And so because of this theme this year,
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.620]   at the beginning of the year,
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.420]   I added a question to these questions that I ask myself.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.060]   And it's this question,
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.020]   have I spent quality time with Jesus this week?
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.500]   Now for me, quality time with Jesus
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.060]   means spending time in prayer,
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.620]   spending time in God's word,
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.020]   journaling, meditating on God's word,
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.300]   just having time to listen, to sit still,
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.380]   to sit in the presence of God.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.340]   And it's also important that I'm not doing that
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.020]   because of work.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.620]   'Cause as you know, I write sermons
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.860]   and I go in God's word prayerfully and I do these things.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.900]   But in this time, it's important
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.180]   that I just go with no agenda,
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.420]   or just go personally,
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.420]   not because I'm trying to write a sermon or something.
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:36.500]   And I found that when I have this intimacy with Jesus,
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.900]   when I actually take time, and I don't always,
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.100]   I'm confessing here as a pastor,
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.820]   but that's why I ask myself those questions
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.620]   because I wanna be on the right track.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.820]   I wanna have that intimacy.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.540]   I wanna hear from Jesus in my life.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.020]   And so that's why I ask myself this question,
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.860]   when I don't have this time,
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.180]   when just suddenly my life spins out of control,
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.860]   I get busy, I do all sorts of things,
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.620]   I lose a lot of times perspective,
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.180]   I lose hope sometimes or joy,
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:13.180]   and I get out of touch with actually what God
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.660]   is saying to me or speaking to us as a family,
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.140]   and even us as a church.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.260]   Now, King David,
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.180]   pondering the significance of God's word,
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.060]   he said this in Psalm 119, 105, famous verse,
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.620]   "Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path."
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.460]   So God's word is the primary way
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.420]   that God makes himself known to us.
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.500]   So he reveals himself to us personally
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.580]   so that we can personally know him.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.700]   But on top of that, God's word also gives us guidance,
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.060]   in where he speaks about us,
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.020]   about situations and circumstances in our lives,
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.180]   where he gives us direction and clarity,
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.580]   what it means to follow him in this particular circumstance
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.460]   that you are facing right now.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:09.140]   And so that is why I asked myself this question,
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.620]   because I wanna hear from God, I wanna encounter God,
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.860]   and I need him to speak into all sorts of circumstances.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.220]   And so I asked myself the question,
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.460]   have I spent quality time with Jesus this week?
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.700]   'Cause I wanna make sure that I hear from him,
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.140]   that I hear from the voice of God,
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.140]   that I hear him speak to me,
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.780]   that I don't just act out of what Tim thinks,
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.900]   but that I'm hearing from him personally.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.220]   So today through this message,
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.460]   what I wanna explore with you,
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.900]   or just a question that I really wanna put before you,
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.380]   and I believe this is also the question
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.100]   that the biblical text that we're gonna look at
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.780]   puts before us is,
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.660]   are we listening to God speak to us through his word?
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:57.620]   Like, do we actually make space in our calendars
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.460]   and our lives to hear from God,
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.100]   the creator of the universe,
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.020]   who has amazing things to say to us, to you,
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:13.380]   who when he speaks, he brings about good things,
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.420]   he wants to bring about good things,
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.860]   he wants to bring about flourishing in your life.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.420]   He wants them to unfold, but do we listen?
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.140]   Do we give God space in our lives to speak?
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.060]   Or do we listen to a bunch of other things, but not to God?
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:36.220]   Well, we're continuing in our Galatians sermon series,
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.020]   and Paul basically asks this question to the Galatians,
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.700]   are you listening to God's word speak to you
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.460]   about the current circumstances,
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.980]   the challenges that they are facing?
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.140]   And so I wanna look with you at that,
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.020]   but before that, I wanna set the context for our passage,
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.740]   because Paul takes the Galatians
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.300]   to what we call the Old Testament,
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.420]   or we could call Hebrew scriptures in this case,
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.940]   he takes them to a story in Genesis.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.780]   And so I wanna retell the story
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.500]   because Paul assumes that his listeners know it,
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.580]   and so he doesn't explain everything
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.900]   as he speaks to them about listening
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.260]   to the voice of God through scripture.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.220]   And so let me set the context.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.540]   So it's a story about Abraham.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:28.340]   Now, God promised Abraham that he will bless him,
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.180]   that we will make him into a great nation,
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.540]   that all people on earth will be blessed through him,
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.620]   that we will give him land,
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.220]   so there's all these promises that God makes Abraham,
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.420]   but there is a problem.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.260]   The problem is, or there's tension in the story,
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.060]   because Sarah, his wife,
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.860]   she has not been able to conceive any children.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.380]   So right from the get-go, there's this question,
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.460]   how is this gonna work if you talk about
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.260]   numerous descendants and all of this?
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.180]   How is this gonna happen?
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.180]   Now, so Abraham and Sarah, they wait,
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.940]   and they wait on God, they wait on God's promise,
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.420]   but nothing seems to happen.
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.780]   So Sarah approaches Abraham,
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.940]   and they take matters into their own hands.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:17.900]   Sarah gives her servant Hagar to Abraham in marriage.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.620]   So this was a common practice among wealthy families
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.540]   where they would do that,
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.260]   and if there's a child born,
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.860]   that then can become the heir of the family.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:35.300]   So they do that, and Hagar gives birth to a child
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.900]   named Ishmael.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:42.820]   Now, God speaks to Abraham again,
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.340]   and this time he makes a covenant.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.420]   So he doesn't just make the promise,
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.580]   but he actually ratifies that in a covenant
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.420]   with Abraham.
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.940]   But he says that the promises that he's making to him,
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.340]   that they will be fulfilled through a child
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.820]   that Sarah will give birth to.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:04.180]   So again, she is, the Bible says she's barren.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.020]   She's not able to bear children,
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:10.180]   but it also says now that she's way beyond the age
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.380]   where women usually give birth.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.540]   And so God wants them, but God promises this,
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.620]   and then within a year, Sarah is pregnant.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.980]   She gives birth to Isaac.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.820]   It's a miracle.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.740]   It's unbelievable.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.740]   God has fulfilled his promise.
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.700]   Now, Isaac and Ishmael, they grow up,
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.580]   and Ishmael, he mocks Isaac.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.660]   And so this then triggers some tension
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.140]   between Hagar and Sarah,
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.900]   and Sarah then ultimately asks Abraham
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.700]   for Ishmael to be kicked out,
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.700]   her and Hagar out of, away from the family.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.700]   And Abraham agrees.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.540]   He talks to God.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.180]   God says, "I will take care of them."
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.380]   And so then they send them away.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.460]   So that's the background of the biblical text
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.020]   that we're gonna look at, the background story.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.340]   So you can keep that in mind as we read that.
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.340]   So let's go to Galatians 4, and starting with verse 21,
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.100]   it says this.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.380]   "Tell me, you who want to be under the law,
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.700]   are you not aware of what the law says?
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.220]   For it is written that Abraham had two sons,
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.540]   one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.580]   His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh,
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.580]   but his son by the free woman was born
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.100]   as a result of divine promise."
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.220]   So Paul addresses the Galatians in verse 21
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.860]   with the phrase, "As those who want to be under the law."
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.820]   Now, this is interesting.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.900]   So again, are they gonna submit themselves to Mosaic law?
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:53.780]   And, you know, for Paul, this would be something negative,
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.780]   but for this group of agitators or Judaizers
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.820]   or rival missionaries,
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.220]   those are three different names we've given them,
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.020]   from that group that came into Galatia
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.460]   and stirred things up and challenged what Paul had preached.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.820]   So they would see that as something positive
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.540]   and would see that as the way
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.380]   of becoming part of God's family.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.740]   But for Paul, he says,
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.460]   "No, that's not the way you become part of God's family,
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.060]   not through observing law, not through human effort,
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.100]   but through faith in Jesus, by the power of God,
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.020]   by the Spirit's work."
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.460]   So that's how they would view that.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:36.740]   Now, Paul then asks the second, or as he continues to say,
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.460]   "Are you not aware of what the law says?"
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.060]   You know, you who want to be under the law,
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.620]   are you not aware of what the law says?
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.500]   Now, a more literal translation of this would be,
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.140]   "Do you not listen to the law?"
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.420]   Now, Paul uses the word law.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.380]   Actually, law was shorthand in the time
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.380]   for all of the Hebrew scripture.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.620]   So Paul is saying, "Do you not listen to God's word?"
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.460]   Now, during that time,
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.740]   people didn't have their apps on the phone
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.540]   or their private Bibles.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.420]   Actually, the written word was something that was really rare,
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.700]   really expensive, really precious.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.580]   So they had either the Hebrew scripture
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.820]   or the Greek version, which is called the Septuagint.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.860]   They had it on parchment, so like animal skin,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.700]   or they had it on papyrus rolls.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.420]   And so the way that most people encountered God's word
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.260]   was simply by hearing, because it was read, it was recited,
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.140]   sometimes it was recited by memory.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.380]   And so that's how they would hear God's word.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.780]   But Paul is not just saying to them,
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.380]   "Are you listening to God's word?"
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.660]   Or, "Do you listen to what the law actually says?"
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.900]   He's saying, "Are you listening to what is God saying
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.740]   "through his word about your current circumstances?"
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.220]   Yeah, are you actually really hearing from God
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.140]   what he is saying through his word
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.660]   to you about your life right now, right here?
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.540]   So that's what's going on there.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.580]   So here we can see that the truth,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.980]   that God loves to speak to us through his word,
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.860]   providing guidance, clarity, and direction for us
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.880]   in our current life circumstances.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.500]   And so God was speaking to the Galatians,
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.460]   but again, there was a question, are they listening?
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.420]   Are they hearing?
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.220]   Are they tuned, and do they desire to hear from God?
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.860]   And Paul is asking that question.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:30.060]   And this actually has a lot of relevance for us today,
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.100]   because God still speaks us through his word.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.940]   He still speaks us about our current circumstances
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.460]   through his word.
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.380]   And not just, are you listening to it, are you studying it,
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.060]   but are you hearing God speak to you
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.020]   about what is happening in your life?
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.620]   Maybe it's about relationships.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.340]   Maybe it's about raising children.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.780]   Maybe it's about justice issues.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.500]   Maybe it's about COVID-19.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.020]   So any of these things, God's word through his spirit,
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.940]   he speaks to his people so that we know,
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.460]   what does it mean to follow Jesus?
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.160]   How should we think about this?
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.660]   What's God's will for the situation?
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.180]   And he loves speaking to his people.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.940]   But again, the question is, are we listening?
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.300]   Do we even hear, or have we learned to hear
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.460]   how God speaks to us and what he's saying?
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:24.460]   So Paul then goes on,
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.060]   and he actually then takes the Galatians to God's word.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.560]   So this is where verse 22 and 23,
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.660]   where it talks about, says,
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.900]   for it is written that Abram had two sons,
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.420]   one by the slave woman, the other by a free woman.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.340]   His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh,
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.260]   but a son by the free woman was born
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.700]   as a result of a divine promise.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.700]   So the phrase, it was written,
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.660]   is Paul's shorthand for whenever he introduces scripture.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.340]   So usually it's a direct quotation from the Bible.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.840]   In this case, it's a summary
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.560]   of what the Hagar-Sara narrative says in the Bible.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.260]   So he's saying, I'm taking you now to God's word.
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:11.320]   And he basically summarizes the story
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.400]   in the following way, where he creates this contrast
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.800]   between the son born to a slave,
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.120]   and the son born to a free woman,
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.160]   and the son born according to the flesh,
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.600]   and the son born as a result of God's promise.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.720]   So we have a table for that.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.400]   Let me show what that looks like.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.520]   So what Paul is doing here,
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.800]   he's showing the contrast between these two things.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.640]   And I wanna especially highlight the contrast
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.400]   between born of the flesh and born as a result
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.900]   of God's promise.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:50.480]   And so this is the part where Sara and Abraham,
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.200]   they were trying out of their own strength
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.400]   to make things happen, by their own power.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.920]   And that's why they asked Hagar to have a,
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.760]   you know, to get married to Abraham, have a child.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.960]   And he says that that was according to the flesh,
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.820]   it was out of the human strength, not by God's strength.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:10.680]   But then in contrast, when Sara gave birth to Isaac,
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.200]   it is by the power of the spirit
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.440]   that this miracle really happens,
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.680]   that Isaac is born,
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.900]   and it's according to the promise that God made.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.760]   Now this is interesting,
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.760]   and I think this is something
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.980]   that we probably can all relate to,
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.280]   that there's many times in our lives
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.160]   where we try to do something out of our human strength.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.240]   We try to make something happen.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.160]   Maybe God spoke to you about something.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.480]   He's gonna do something in your life,
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.860]   and you're waiting and you're waiting,
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:39.760]   you get tired of waiting,
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.320]   and you're like, I'm just gonna now try it
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.840]   on my own effort to make this happen.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.060]   And so we go for it.
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.000]   Now I can relate to that, I've done that.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.040]   I remember, so I've shared before where my life
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.720]   at that point in time in many ways fell apart,
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.600]   broken relationship, loss of job, loss of home,
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.200]   all of those things.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.520]   And so in that time, God met me and spoke to me,
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.600]   and it was helpful, and I started moving forward.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.760]   But there was this point where it was like,
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.000]   I want things to be right again.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.840]   And I wanna see that happening.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.120]   So I was striving really hard,
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.520]   I was trying really hard to bring about these things
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.000]   in my life that I can experience wholeness,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.120]   that I can figure out what I'm doing job wise.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.320]   And I was trying as hard as I could,
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.480]   and it was actually creating a lot of anxiety,
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.920]   and also not much was happening.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.300]   And so then during one time, spending time in God's word,
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:41.360]   he spoke to me through a passage where he told me
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.700]   that he will establish me in his time.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.160]   And so this was a promise.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.200]   And then basically, for me then,
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.960]   I was actually was really helpful
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.240]   because I was trying so hard, I was striving,
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.040]   and I just realized I just need to trust
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.440]   and have faith in God that he will meet me,
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.120]   especially now that he's spoken,
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.980]   that he will meet me, that he will establish me,
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.960]   that he will sort things out in my life,
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.360]   even though right now it's a big mess,
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.240]   and I don't know what to do,
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.800]   and I'm just trying to set things right myself.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.200]   And so that removed a lot of the anxiety and stress for me
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.760]   as I started trusting God,
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.720]   that he will fulfill what he says by his power,
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.480]   by his spirit, not by my effort.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.600]   But so here we see these two lines.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.080]   One is the path of works,
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.000]   the other one is the path of grace and the power of God.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.540]   And so Paul is laying this before the Galatians.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.500]   But let's continue in verse 24.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.720]   It says this, "These things are being taken figuratively.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.400]   "The woman represents two covenants.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.320]   "One covenant is from Mount Sinai
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.960]   "and bears children who are to be slaves, that is Hagar.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.960]   "Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.440]   "and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.000]   "because she is in slavery with her children.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.960]   "But the Jerusalem that is above is free,
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.260]   "and she is our mother.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.540]   "For it is written, 'Be glad, barren woman,
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.100]   "'you who never bore a child,
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.440]   "'break forth and cry aloud,
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.120]   "'you who were never in labor,
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.920]   "'because more are the children
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.520]   "'of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.'"
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.320]   So here Paul, I notice this very complicated, this text,
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.640]   but Paul is basically moving from,
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.840]   first he summarized scripture theologically,
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.400]   now he's saying I'm interpreting this figuratively for you.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.600]   And I'm showing how this applies
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.740]   to your life, to your circumstances.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.800]   And he's drawing this comparison
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.160]   between these two lineages, again,
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.880]   and just further develops that.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.920]   So let's visualize that, let's put that up.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.440]   So here you have the path of works continues,
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.600]   it's the Mosaic Covenant, he talks about two covenants.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.600]   It's Hagar, Mount Sinai, slavery, present Jerusalem.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.980]   So that's the one lineage, then you have the other one,
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.360]   it's the new covenant, it's our mother,
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.780]   probably implies Mount Sinai, but it's not clear,
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.400]   so I didn't put that in, freedom, Jerusalem.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.880]   So again, God lays before his people
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.440]   these two different tracks, two different paths,
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.200]   the paths of work, the path of grace.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.860]   And the one leads to enslavement,
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.240]   you know, this leads to enslavement,
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   and this leads to life, freedom, relationship with God.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:40.500]   Now, Paul also, and I'm gonna keep this short on this part,
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.040]   Paul also really brings it into the present
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.600]   when he talks about present Jerusalem
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.740]   and the Jerusalem that is above, so let me explain that.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.960]   So the present Jerusalem, you know,
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.320]   refers to all those who are under the Mosaic law,
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.740]   who are seeking, now that crisis come,
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.040]   who are seeking to earn right standing, you know,
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.560]   with God through observing the law,
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.760]   to be in a part of the family of God,
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.200]   and then they're putting forth these human efforts,
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   so that's this track, and then the Jerusalem that is above
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.760]   are people who have placed their faith in Jesus,
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.900]   who have been born again, born by the Spirit,
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:27.600]   who are now a new creation, where God has done something new,
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.720]   where have, like, this new creation
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.560]   is breaking into our present age,
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.920]   and so this is where, it's a spiritual reality,
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.040]   the Jerusalem that is above.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.760]   And so Paul takes the story and he puts this before him,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.520]   these are the two tracks, these are the two pathways,
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.200]   and then he draws an application,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.960]   and this is the last part of the scripture
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.440]   that we're gonna look at, so continue verse 28 says,
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.520]   now you brothers and sisters,
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.280]   like Isaac, are children of promise.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.220]   At that time, the Son, born according to the flesh,
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.160]   persecuted the Son born by the power of the Spirit.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.040]   It is the same now, but what does scripture say?
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.400]   Get rid of the slave woman and her son,
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.280]   for the slave woman's son will never share
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.120]   in the inheritance with the free woman's son.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.840]   Therefore, brothers and sisters,
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.980]   we are not children of a slave woman,
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.880]   but of the free woman.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.880]   So Paul has taken the Galatians to the scripture passage,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.760]   he's saying God is speaking through this passage to them
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.200]   about their present circumstances,
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.280]   and he's holding before them these two pathways,
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.720]   how, and now he's, basically there's two applications.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.760]   One of them, he tells the Galatians, Christians,
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.440]   that they are children of the promise,
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.360]   and children of the free woman.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.760]   So he tells them their identity.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.760]   It's like, you are part of God's promise being fulfilled.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:02.000]   You are part, you are born of the Spirit, you are free.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.080]   That is who you are.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.760]   Why would you go back under the law?
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.460]   So that's basically what he's saying there.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.600]   And this is by God's power, not by our own strength.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.680]   And then the second thing that Paul says is,
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:22.480]   get rid of, you need to get rid of the agitators
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.400]   that are among you, that have been stirring things up,
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.720]   that have been undermining the truth of the gospel.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   And so he's talking about that basically
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.680]   they've been persecuting them or harassing them.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.000]   He's saying you need to cut them off.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.960]   You need to cut yourself off from them.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.000]   And so that is what God is saying to the Galatians.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.400]   This is who you are,
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.600]   and this is how you respond to the situation.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   Now, this, to us,
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.400]   it's not easy to take in, but you have to think about.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.000]   So God is speaking to his people.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.360]   He's speaking to them about something
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.960]   that they are really wrestling with,
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.600]   you know, that really has caused
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.400]   all these problems among them.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.600]   And now God speaks and he gives them clarity
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.240]   through his word, you know, how they can move forward,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.680]   how they can understand the situation.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.560]   And he does that because he wants to bring life.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.320]   He wants to see this life of the Spirit,
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.560]   this life that God wants to unfold among them.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.920]   He wants to see that unfold.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.840]   And so he's speaking, but the question is,
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.080]   are they listening?
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.600]   You know, are they hearing from God?
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.800]   Now I want to talk about us.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   I want to bring this to a more practical level.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.040]   You know, are we listening to God speak to us
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.120]   through his word?
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.760]   So the, you know, Hagar and Sarah narrative
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.160]   or the Abraham story with the two sons,
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.180]   that was not written to the Galatians.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.340]   That was written to a different group of people
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:59.940]   in Israel's history, but it did apply
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.940]   to the present circumstances they were facing in Galatia.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:09.460]   And so the Bible is not written to us,
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.460]   but it is written for us.
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.580]   Now, what does this mean?
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.940]   It means that God's, you know, God's word,
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.940]   the Bible was written to people
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.060]   at a specific time in history
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:26.060]   with a specific purpose and a specific cultural context.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:31.420]   And so in that sense, it's not written to us,
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.180]   but God's word is God breathed.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.660]   So it's written for us.
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.820]   God speaks to us, even despite,
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.340]   and here, I think in this passage,
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.020]   we do see that there is a cultural gap, you know,
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.420]   between what's discussed in our own life,
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.580]   but it is God's word and he speaks to us
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.100]   through his word because it's God breathed.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.580]   He speaks to his people.
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.420]   Now, of course, we can learn skills
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.020]   on how to interpret it, you know, a little bit better,
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.300]   but the important thing is that God loves speaking
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.980]   to his people and he helps us with the Holy Spirit
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.980]   to understand what his word says
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.420]   and how that word applies, you know, to us specifically.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.780]   Now, a lot of times when we read God's word,
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.660]   we read it like we've learned how to read.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.500]   So in school, we learn to read in a way
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.460]   that we gather information so that we can write the essay
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.060]   or that we can answer the questions.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.020]   We read very informationally,
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.620]   or maybe if you're in business,
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:27.780]   maybe you read your financial reports, you study it,
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.620]   and then you gather all the key information,
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.200]   and that's how you get all the facts.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.380]   But if you wanna hear God speak through his word,
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.500]   we have to move beyond just reading it
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.420]   in this informational way.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.940]   We need to read it relationally.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.380]   We need to read it prayerfully.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.380]   And so reading the Bible prayerfully
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.980]   helps us to prepare ourselves to hear from God.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:57.700]   You know, Lord, help me understand what I'm reading here.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.340]   Speak to me, I'm here, your servant's listening.
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.300]   It's quite a different posture than when I go,
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.180]   okay, this is like homework, you know,
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.980]   okay, here are the facts of the story.
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.220]   Quite different.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.180]   And as we read God's word prayerfully,
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.820]   you know, God speaks to his people.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.260]   He will speak to you.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.020]   He will speak to us as a community,
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.420]   but he also will speak to you individually.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.900]   By speaking, I don't mean an audible voice,
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.820]   but I mean, you know, inside your heart, inside your mind,
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.660]   God will reveal things and make things clear to you
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.820]   that were not clear before,
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.740]   and you will know that it's not from you,
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.020]   but it is something that God is saying to you.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.740]   So God loves to make himself known.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.340]   He loves to speak to us.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:46.340]   Now, as Christians,
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.620]   one thing that I think is important for us,
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.220]   we wanna bring what's going on in our lives
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.100]   and what's happening in our circumstance.
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.340]   So not just with us individually,
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.540]   but what's happening in our city,
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.020]   what's happening in Yuen Long,
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.700]   what's happening with people experiencing poverty.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.660]   And we wanna bring those things prayerfully
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.660]   in dialogue with God's word,
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.540]   so that he speaks to us about these current circumstances,
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.940]   gives us wisdom about how he is calling us,
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.580]   leading us to move forward in those specific things.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.780]   And I wanna give an example personally.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:22.820]   Quite a while, actually, probably like 10 years ago,
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.900]   so I had a horrible conflict, preached about it before,
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:30.900]   where I just afterwards was exhausted,
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:36.140]   tired, really struggling to forgive.
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:41.420]   I mean, I even was like, almost like shaking
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   and just like really knocked down flat from this conflict.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.100]   And I really was struggling to forgive.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.580]   I was like, I don't know how to forgive.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:58.580]   And so this struggle led me to go back to God's word.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.660]   And so what I find interesting,
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.900]   now that I've studied this before,
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.060]   and so I had certain answers about what forgiveness is,
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.780]   what reconciliation is,
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.660]   but now in this desperate situation
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.420]   with a specific conflict,
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:14.220]   where I really just could not move past it.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.460]   As I was searching scripture,
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.540]   and this was also, by the way,
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.500]   not like one time I turned to the Bible
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.540]   and then everything was clear.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.260]   This was an ongoing process.
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.140]   But God really spoke to me about what forgiveness is,
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.180]   what reconciliation is.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:34.180]   And I realized that I had confused these concepts.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.280]   So I thought forgiving means reconciling,
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.340]   so working things out
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.100]   and having the relationship reestablished.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.300]   But actually forgiving is just forgiving
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.700]   and letting go of the offense of that person.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.980]   And God's word says, we forgive,
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.420]   we're actually commanded to forgive.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.080]   So forgiveness is a command,
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:57.260]   while reconciliation is a ministry.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.860]   So reconciliation is something that we can only do
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:05.300]   if the other person is also maybe repentant
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.220]   of what they have done,
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.580]   if they're willing to engage in a process.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.100]   So reconciliation takes two people.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.020]   So for me, as I was wrestling with this conflict
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.940]   and God was bringing this clarity,
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.820]   I had clarity now on how I could follow Jesus
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.640]   in this conflict.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.220]   He was asking me to forgive, which was struggling with,
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.820]   and then I prayerfully wrestled with that
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.540]   and God helped me to forgive.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.060]   But I also realized that reconciliation,
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:32.780]   just going back to the relationship and how things were,
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.220]   was not something that I could just bring about
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.140]   out of my own.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.940]   It also involved the other person,
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.380]   and it even involved them doing things
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.500]   that I cannot control.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.780]   And so that was so helpful and so powerful to me.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.900]   Another example, if you think more about,
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.500]   for us as a church during the pandemic,
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.980]   a lot of churches were asking,
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.980]   what is God saying to us during COVID?
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:40:00.440]   Where people are experiencing fear, anxiety, isolation,
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:05.300]   maybe sometimes feel really even labeled,
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.180]   if you had COVID and everybody treated you
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.980]   like you either have a horrible disease
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.740]   and nobody wants to get anywhere near to you,
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.940]   it's like dropping a food, running away as fast as they can
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.500]   without you opening the door and all of that stuff.
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.340]   And churches around the world did that.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.500]   And so one thing that God spoke to us
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.700]   at the Vine very clearly about is the importance
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.580]   of community and relationships and community groups
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:36.580]   and that we need to tend and invest in and spend time
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.020]   caring for one another and checking in with one another.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.620]   So God was speaking to his people
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.460]   on how to engage in that time.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:50.660]   So I wanna invite the worship team to come up.
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:56.100]   And as I was preparing for this message,
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.180]   what I sensed was that God is just really putting
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.820]   this question before us.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:07.140]   Are you listening to him speak?
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.300]   Are you giving space for God to speak to you
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.060]   through his word?
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:17.060]   Do you look to God's word for guidance in your life?
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:21.380]   Is God's word, does God's word have authority
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.380]   over your life?
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:27.300]   Where you place yourself, it's like, this is what God says.
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.500]   And even though maybe this maybe seems hard,
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.180]   because it's what God says, it is, I'm gonna do it.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.460]   'Cause I know that ultimately what God's word says
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.220]   is the best thing and it gives life.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.860]   And are we obedient when God speaks?
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.620]   And are we carving out a space?
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.580]   Because it's incredible that God speaks to us.
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:51.420]   That he wants to speak to you about the circumstances,
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.980]   the challenges that you are facing
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.500]   even right here and right now.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.300]   And I know we are.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.180]   I know many of us are.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:04.700]   But are we opening our hearts, our lives to God
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.980]   to speak into our lives?
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.620]   Or are there other things speaking into our life?
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:14.460]   And I just felt that God just wants to light a fire
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:18.580]   in our hearts and give us this desire
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.060]   where he say, Jesus, I wanna hear from you.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.780]   I wanna know what it means to follow you
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.180]   in this circumstance, at this point in time.
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.500]   I don't know what to do.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.940]   I wanna hear from you.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:33.780]   Or Jesus, how should I think about?
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.940]   I don't know how to think about this.
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.100]   Lord, help me to give a way
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.900]   of how I can think about this in the right way.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.500]   I wanna hear from you.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.820]   I wanna honor you.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.300]   I wanna surrender to you and do things your way,
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.420]   not my way.
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.780]   So I just wanna invite everyone to stand.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:59.580]   And I don't know if you have time
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.260]   or something scheduled in your calendar
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.380]   where you actually spend time with God.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.500]   You know, there's actually a time in there
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.100]   where you carve out time to hear from Jesus.
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.700]   But I just would love to pray over us.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:21.140]   And if you, yeah, just wanna express to Jesus,
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.940]   like, Jesus, I wanna hear from you.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.300]   Or maybe it's even a specific thing
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.820]   that you need to hear from him about.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.220]   I wanna encourage you to stretch out your hands.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:31.940]   Let me pray for you.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.140]   Jesus, I thank you so much
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.940]   that you are the God who speaks,
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.420]   that we can know your voice,
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.500]   that we can hear from you.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.140]   And we don't know what to do,
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.500]   but you do.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.060]   And you have a way forward.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:56.380]   You have a perspective that we often lack and don't have.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.940]   And Lord, I wanna pray for you.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.620]   And Lord, you know all the circumstance
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.460]   that people are facing
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.060]   where they need to hear from you, Lord.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.340]   I pray that you would speak.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:12.060]   I pray that you would help to reprioritize
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.260]   just giving you time where you just come
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.500]   and just say, Jesus, I'm here.
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.260]   Speak to me.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.820]   Speak into my life.
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:25.860]   Show me your heart.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.460]   (gentle music)
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:35.500]   So Lord, yeah, I pray that we would be a church
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.780]   where you are at the center of our lives,
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.860]   where we know what you are saying to us.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.620]   When we ask each other, what's God saying to you?
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.180]   That we know what you're speaking to us.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:51.820]   And I pray that we can encourage each other
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:55.820]   to just always keep coming back to your word,
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.180]   to hear from you.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:01.260]   And so will you do this work among us?
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.500]   Will you speak to us?
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.700]   Will you speak to those of us who are struggling?
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.140]   Will you give a word, Lord?
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.980]   We desperately long for it and we thank you for it.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.500]   I pray this in your name, Jesus, amen.
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.860]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
