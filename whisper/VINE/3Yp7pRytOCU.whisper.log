[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420]   Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.240]   Good morning, how's everyone doing?
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.480]   Good, good to see you guys.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.640]   I want to just say hi to everyone watching online
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.680]   around the world, half my family's in Japan,
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.100]   I just want to say hi.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.760]   And outside, you guys, I wish you were here,
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.120]   but I'll join you guys in a week or two.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.620]   And I also just want to say hi, Upper House,
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.420]   I can't see you, but I know you're there.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.460]   Welcome, my name is Justin, one of the pastors here.
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.680]   If this is your first time, I personally want to welcome you.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.120]   We feel like a big church, but once you get to know us,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.980]   it gets better, so come to Newcomers today,
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.020]   it's gonna be fun.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.980]   Yeah, so the Vine has been my home
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.480]   for almost the last two decades.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.020]   I came here as a young adult, I served,
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.140]   got called into ministry, continue to remain
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.400]   in ministry right now, met my wife here,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.140]   celebrated the milestones of life with a lot of you,
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.180]   and so this is my home here.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.500]   And so you may ask, Justin, what do you do?
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.100]   Well, let me tell you, I am a pastoral care pastor.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.780]   What that means simply is when you email me,
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.700]   I reply to your email, and together with my pastoral team,
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.980]   we figure out a way to support and walk with you.
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.680]   And so do reach out if there is anything,
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.420]   yeah, we would love to serve you.
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.660]   And so in the past four weeks, if you've joined us,
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.860]   we are in a series of forgiveness.
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860]   And so we've been reflecting on the different aspects
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.480]   of forgiveness, what it is, what it isn't,
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.480]   that we cannot forgive, we cannot forgive on our own strength
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.880]   and that the core, what makes Christianity so special
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.400]   and unique is that it is centered around forgiveness
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.480]   and that forgiveness renews us.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.240]   And last week, we had the privilege of having Pastor Jennifer,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.560]   Pastor Jess, Allison, and Charles remind us
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.400]   that we cannot forgive or extend forgiveness
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.580]   without the community.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.280]   And the health of the church depend
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.080]   on whether we forgive or not.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.400]   And so I would probably be confident to say
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.640]   that this is not an easy series.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.800]   It's not easy because forgiveness is a reality
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.960]   that all of us must diligently work at and work through.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.140]   Forgiveness is not something where we just wake up
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.480]   or we come to church and done, solved,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.600]   or else, I don't know, I think we would be
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.160]   a lot more happier people, right, if that was the case.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.720]   But it is a journey.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.600]   Forgiveness is a discipleship journey.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.360]   That means if you and I are serious about being a Christian,
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.560]   then we must take what Jesus says to focus on,
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.260]   which is forgiveness.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.760]   So we're in it together and I hope you won't be scared
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.640]   and let us just keep on going.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.600]   And so this week, my time with you,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.880]   I want to just pack in a lot, but at the same time,
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.680]   I want today to be very practical.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.220]   So we're gonna explore how to attain forgiveness
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.680]   for ourselves and wherever you are,
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.200]   no matter what season you're in.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.120]   Maybe some of you don't even know why you're here
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.100]   in the church, but I'm so glad you're here
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.880]   because we're gonna figure out a way how you and I
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.880]   can engage in this journey of forgiveness.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.280]   Is that all right?
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.920]   So I want to highlight three difficulties and complexities
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   relating to attaining forgiveness for ourselves
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.960]   and hopefully we can, anyways, actually,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.980]   I wanted to ask you.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.360]   This is not on my script,
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.760]   but what is your sermon game plan?
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.120]   Do you have one?
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.620]   So when you come to church, do you have an expectation
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.080]   of how God might speak to you?
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.760]   You know, sometimes for some of us, we're like,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.440]   oh, when we worship, God speaks to us.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.800]   When we listen to the word of God, God speaks to us.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.040]   So I want to encourage you today,
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.520]   whatever your sermon gaming plan is,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.120]   I have been praying for the last many weeks
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.040]   that God would just speak one thing to you
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.440]   and that you would have the courage to hold onto that
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.920]   and work that out and figure out how that works
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.760]   in your life.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.820]   Is that all right?
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.400]   So that is what I want to encourage you.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.640]   So I want to begin, I want to set the scene for today
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.120]   and I'm gonna read us this beautiful passage
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.760]   in Luke 7, verse 36 to 50.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.160]   So the context is this story is about the interaction
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.920]   between Jesus and Simon the Pharisee
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.160]   who invites Jesus to his house
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.600]   and also this story is about an unnamed sinful woman
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.560]   who is a prostitute.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.360]   She comes unannounced to Simon's house
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.600]   and we're gonna look at this together.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.200]   And as I read this, I want you just to think about one thing.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.520]   I want you to consider, okay,
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.820]   why some people can love God more than others.
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.960]   Okay, so you can read with me if you want.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.520]   Verse 36, when one of the Pharisees
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.680]   invited Jesus to have dinner with him,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.160]   he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.120]   A woman in that town who lived a sinful life
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.880]   learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.740]   So she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.800]   As she stood behind him at his feet weeping,
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.560]   she began to wet his feet with her tears.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.520]   Then she wiped them with her hair,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.680]   kissed them and poured perfume on them.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.560]   Verse 39, when the Pharisee, that is Simon,
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.640]   who had invited Jesus saw this,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.600]   he said to himself, if this man were a prophet,
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.440]   he would know who is touching him
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.480]   and what kind of woman she is, that she is a sinner.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   Jesus answered him, Simon, I have something to tell you.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.140]   Tell me, teacher, Simon said.
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.640]   Two people owed money to a certain money lender.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.280]   One owed him 500 denarii and the other 50.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.420]   Neither of them had the money to pay him back.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.040]   So he forgave the debts of both.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.340]   Now which of them will love him more?
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.800]   Simon replied, I suppose the one
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.680]   who had the bigger debt forgiven.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.960]   You have judged correctly, Jesus said.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.560]   Then Jesus turned toward the woman and also said to Simon,
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.320]   do you see this woman?
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.080]   I came into your house.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.720]   You did not give me any water for my feet,
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.800]   but she wet my feet with her tears
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   and wiped them with her hair.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.560]   You did not give me a kiss,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.160]   but this woman from the time I entered
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.440]   has not stopped kissing my feet.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.920]   You did not put oil on my head,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.040]   but she poured perfume on my feet.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.000]   Therefore, Simon, I tell you,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.700]   her many sins have been forgiven
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.820]   as her great love has shown.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.720]   But whoever has been forgiven, little loves little.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.880]   Then Jesus said to this woman, your sins are forgiven.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.240]   The other guests began to say amongst themselves,
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.400]   who is this who even forgives sins?
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.380]   Jesus said to the woman, your faith has saved you.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.740]   Go in peace.
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.200]   Can we say that the response of the woman
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.260]   and Simon cannot be any more different?
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.520]   From the moment this sinful woman came into Simon's house,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.280]   uninvited, unannounced, her actions,
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.920]   the way she loved and kissed and wept and anointed Jesus
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.080]   said that there was nothing too good for Jesus.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.240]   This woman, the difference between this woman and Simon,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.080]   we can say that this woman was fully conscious
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.120]   and could appreciate how much she was forgiven
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.040]   and that's why she could love the way she did.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.400]   Now, Simon, by contrast,
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.920]   Simon from I think our perspective,
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.240]   we would say that he's a bit rude, he's a bit distant,
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.080]   he's a bit disrespectful for not even attending
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.480]   to the common courtesies that the Pharisees
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.960]   would have known such as washing the guest's feet,
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.800]   greeting with a kiss on a cheek,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.960]   and of course anointing a guest with oil on their head.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.760]   Perhaps Simon didn't fully comprehend
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.880]   how much God had forgiven him already.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.240]   Perhaps Simon did not feel like he had to acknowledge
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.880]   the sins that he's committed.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.200]   And so if I were to read into this a bit more,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.720]   this story suggests that if,
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.940]   imagine if Simon in the moment of having Jesus
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.720]   in his own house realized what a sinful and wretched man
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.840]   he actually was and he just gave himself to Lord.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.540]   What do you think would happen in this story?
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.400]   But in this story, it's the sinful woman
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.300]   who had such adoration and gratitude for our Lord Jesus.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.700]   When I read this, I thought of growing up,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.760]   my growing up story.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.600]   I came to Christ, Christ found me as a wretched liar.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.800]   I stole, I lied, I wrecked relationships when I was 16.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.240]   I've not looked back ever since.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.100]   And I remember when I came to Christ,
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.320]   I worshiped like this woman.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.940]   You know, I would just weep in church,
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.800]   I would just fall down and pray,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.200]   and to this day I still, I want to worship
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.820]   and love the Jesus like this woman did.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.920]   But of course, you and I know life catches up.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.560]   We encounter difficulties, we go through seasons.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.240]   As we grow up, our values change,
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.080]   the way we see things change.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.420]   And many days, I want to confess
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.720]   that I feel like I'm more like Simon.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.960]   I come here, I'm a bit arrogant, a bit apathetic,
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.100]   my arms are crossed, I forget how much God
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.800]   has done in my life, I forget what God has done
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.880]   this week in my life.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.200]   And as a result, I forget that I'm forgiven.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.600]   But I go on living like I'm not forgiven.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.080]   And that affects my love for you.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.680]   That affects my love for my friends and family,
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.960]   those, my enemies it affects.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   And so if forgiveness is a discipleship issue,
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.560]   then today we can also say that forgiveness
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.180]   has everything to do with love
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.560]   and whether you can receive forgiveness.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.200]   And this story radically reframes our approach
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.540]   to receiving forgiveness for ourselves,
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.340]   because if to receive forgiveness for ourselves
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.640]   requires love, then how do we attain that love?
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.600]   That love must be first the realization
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.280]   that we are forgiven.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.820]   And from the fact that we're forgiven, we must respond.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.160]   We must figure out and just look at
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.680]   what it means to be grateful.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.280]   And then we take that next step.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:23.520]   And so this morning, I want to just ask you
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.560]   to critically examine your own life.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.920]   I'm not here to judge you, but I want you to,
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.080]   I'm gonna talk about three areas that hinder,
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.820]   and it really radically affects
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.080]   the way we receive forgiveness.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.340]   And these three areas are, I wanna look at our sins,
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.520]   I wanna look at our excuses,
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.020]   and I wanna look at our guilt.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.900]   And I want you just in this time,
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.200]   I know that God is already at work
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.940]   and that God would reveal to us just one thing,
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.860]   how any of these one things or maybe three things
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.120]   hold us back from receiving forgiveness.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.020]   Is that all right?
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.880]   So the first thing we're gonna look at is our sin.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:09.160]   And the reality is that all of us sin.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.900]   Sin is our everyday human experience
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.400]   and it's part of our nature.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.220]   It's something that we cannot part with.
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.620]   Isaiah 64, four reminds us,
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.560]   all of us have become like one who is unclean,
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.140]   and all of our righteous acts are like filthy rags,
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.140]   and like the wind, the sin sweeps us away.
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.740]   This scripture says that as long as we are
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.480]   in this moral decaying body, sin will dwell in us,
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.440]   and we cannot help but to commit inexcusable acts
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.620]   against God, against one another, and against creation.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.900]   We cannot escape this reality.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:52.140]   And to furthermore, our unchecked sin,
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.100]   if we do not look at our sin, take it seriously,
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.820]   then it's gonna have dire and long-term consequences
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.300]   in our life.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.380]   For example, we know that unchecked sin
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.300]   will continue to disconnect us relationally.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.220]   Unchecked sin, unrepented sin will continue
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.360]   to erect emotional barriers behind, between us,
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.300]   so that we cannot really communicate.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.860]   We cannot really fully appreciate what we're doing.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.740]   And of course, if we do not address
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.460]   and take our sin seriously, then our sin will cause us
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.340]   to act on our dark, insatiable desires,
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.860]   we'll act out in fear, our insecurities, our jealousy,
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.920]   our ego will continue then to cause hurt,
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.300]   will continue to destroy, abuse each other,
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.760]   manipulate, control, and seek retribution.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.900]   But this morning I want to once again remind us
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.460]   of the gospel, the good news,
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.500]   is that no matter how dark it gets,
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.880]   no matter, even if we are all sinners by nature,
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.100]   the good news is that we are all equally placed
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.740]   to receive, to come to God and receive
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.620]   his free, merciful grace for us, just like this woman did.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.360]   So this means that when we repent, when we confess,
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.820]   when we allow the Lord to say, "You are forgiven, go,"
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.500]   then we can, like this woman,
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.160]   truly love deeply and unashamedly.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.280]   I want to read 1 John 1, 9 again.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.880]   I know Ellison and Promise read this, but it's so good,
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.940]   especially in this context right now.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.320]   This scripture says, "If we," church, "confess our sins,
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.120]   "God is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.000]   "and purify us from all unrighteousness."
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.160]   So as we confess, the Holy Spirit comes to us
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.120]   and renews us and restores us and leads us
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.720]   in a path of healing, and this promise is as sure
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.200]   as the rising and the setting of the sun.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.520]   However, I love these however, I want to warn you
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.540]   that, of course, this promise is conditional,
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.520]   depending on what we make of forgiveness.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:09.740]   So, church, if we ignore and disregard this very reality
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.400]   that sin dwells in us and that is always at work against us,
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.200]   then our lives, sadly, will remain miserable.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.600]   It will be difficult.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.320]   We will get lost in it, which I don't think anyone wants.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:29.600]   And so to disregard sin, sometimes what happens
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.560]   is that we just continue to pretend
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.280]   that everything's all right.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.480]   Sometimes we run away.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.720]   Sometimes we tell ourselves and others this false narrative
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.720]   so that we don't have to deal with anything,
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.440]   and sometimes we even use substances
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.120]   to help us ignore the reality
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.760]   that we have to confront our sin.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.000]   And so our tendency to adequately not address our sin
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.200]   is probably the cause of a lot of our internal suffering,
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.780]   our emotional dis-ease, our anxiety,
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.880]   our fear of being found out, and of course,
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.000]   whatever happens inside, it just eventually
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.840]   gets pushed onto others around us.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.800]   So how should we respond this morning?
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.420]   I want to say that we can start
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:18.420]   by accepting our propensity to sin.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.380]   Now, I'm not advocating that we accept our sinfulness
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.460]   and carry on like it's no problem.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.860]   I'm not saying that.
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.860]   I'm saying that would we have the courage today
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.200]   to look at our sinfulness and actually figure out
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.300]   how this is causing havoc in our lives,
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.800]   how it's hurting not just ourselves but those around us?
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.640]   Because our attempt to avoid the reality of sin
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.520]   is actually evidence and a symptom of our sinfulness.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.020]   And what sin does is it will keep us in the dark.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.020]   Sin will not want to be exposed.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.520]   Our sin will prevent us from actually seeing clearly.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.100]   And sin, of course, keeps us from doing
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.780]   what we ought to do, what we want to do,
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.860]   what we desperately, genuinely want to do,
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.700]   which is to change.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.420]   And so, church, today, if you are serious
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.440]   about following Jesus, then let us take our sins seriously.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.500]   I would say that acceptance is the immediate
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.900]   and long-term solution because as we journey
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.360]   on this way of receiving forgiveness,
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.940]   we encounter Jesus like this woman,
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.720]   and suddenly things look different.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.820]   The second difficulty and complexity
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.820]   I want to look at today is our tendency to make excuses.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.560]   As broken humanity, we cannot help
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.520]   but to habitually make excuses.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.320]   I love making excuses.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.880]   I don't know about you, but I genuinely,
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.000]   I mean, I don't love it, but I know I do it.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.880]   We make excuses or we excuse ourselves
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.080]   from doing something because at the end of the day,
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.000]   we don't want to face reality.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.040]   We don't want to face the consequences
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.440]   of our sin and the truth.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.080]   And so what we do is we say deceptive things,
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.760]   i.e. we lie, in order to make ourselves feel better
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.800]   and to give this impression that, you know what?
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.260]   We're okay, I'm okay.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.960]   And we do this by rationalizing, by blaming,
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.240]   by obsessively trying to put together the perfect alibi,
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.520]   the perfect excuse, so that we don't have to come to God,
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.680]   so that we don't have to come to each other.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.280]   And let us think about Simon again
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.040]   because I feel like Simon's distancedness,
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.580]   his coldness in that moment,
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.760]   maybe could be explained by his excuses.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.480]   You know, can you imagine what Simon
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.840]   must have said at that moment?
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.480]   You know, one, he was probably shocked
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.160]   at the woman's response, but he also probably said
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.240]   in his mind, you know what?
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.440]   I'm religious.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.720]   I go to the temple every day.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.840]   I teach at the temple.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.620]   Ask anyone around me, ask these guests around me.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.180]   I tithe.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.320]   I'm a righteous man.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.120]   And in a way, Simon self-justified himself
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.480]   from having to repent of anything.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.600]   Therefore, he didn't confess,
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.220]   and therefore, his love remained little.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.840]   And so in Simon Church,
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.140]   I think we have a cautionary tale here.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:20.720]   And this cuts really close to home, especially for me.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.000]   It's really easy for us to come to church on a Sunday
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.120]   and worship and leave here
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.160]   believing and imagining that we have already
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.920]   confessed our sins, when actually,
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.360]   sometimes our excuses tell us otherwise.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.800]   So let me give you an example.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.240]   We do this when we confess vague and general sins
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.380]   rather than being very specific
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.960]   about how I actually sinned against you,
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.820]   how I actually offended God.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.140]   So because I think it's a lot easier
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.440]   to come here on a Sunday, or even just every day
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.640]   in your life, to say, Lord, I'm sorry.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.480]   I'm gonna move on now.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.480]   And you feel all right,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.920]   but actually, you haven't dealt with the issue.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.360]   And for me, if I were to be honest,
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.720]   there are so many Sundays.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.440]   I know I'm supposed to be here, and I am here,
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.960]   but some days, my heart just says,
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.560]   Lord, this week has been so tough.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.720]   I'm actually, I blame you for this week.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.340]   I blame you for what this person said,
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.240]   and therefore, I'm not gonna worship you.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.080]   Why would I worship you?
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.540]   And this conversation goes.
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.160]   But at some point, I just say, Lord, you know what?
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.320]   I'm just gonna trust that you're gonna do something
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.320]   to soften my heart.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.500]   And so how do we respond to our tendency to make excuses?
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.000]   Well, I want to quote the great C.S. Lewis,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.280]   'cause he offers some helpful thoughts
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.260]   on how we can counter this propensity of ours.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.440]   First, we must remember that our God
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.320]   knows all the actual excuses we give
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.900]   better than all of us, right?
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.640]   This should be a comfort,
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.520]   because when Jesus died on the cross on our behalf,
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.880]   he already confronted our sin
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.640]   and the excuses that we would give,
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.720]   and he died in our place,
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.280]   in all its horror, malice, and resentment.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.960]   This is why the woman could come to Jesus
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.900]   without any excuse,
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.600]   because the Lord Jesus knew exactly what she's done.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.760]   She didn't have to justify anything,
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.760]   because what Jesus offered was freedom,
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.880]   and so she would rather have that freedom
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.080]   than suffer any, doesn't matter.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.120]   You know, and the example that I think of is,
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.080]   well, when we go to a doctor,
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.400]   when was the last time you went to a doctor
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.080]   and you told them, hey, doc,
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.160]   I know I'm paying a lot of money for your time,
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.000]   but I want to tell you, I had a,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.440]   this month I've been so healthy, I've been exercising.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.920]   Thanks for listening, I don't need medicine, thank you,
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.600]   I'm just gonna go and pay.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.920]   We don't go to a doctor to tell them how healthy we are.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.840]   We go to a doctor to assess why we're so sick
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.920]   and we want to get better.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.640]   And so likewise, this woman understood
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.080]   that when we come to Jesus, there is a promise,
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.180]   there is a possibility, a potentiality of freedom.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.000]   So why would we not take that?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.880]   And so today, if you come to God and say,
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.900]   Lord, would you forgive me?
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.220]   I think his answer would be yes, I am willing.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.760]   The last complexity I want to look at
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.720]   is has everything to do with our guilt.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.040]   Now, there are so many moments in all of our lives
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.280]   that we get overwhelmed by guilt
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.080]   because of what we've done, what we continue to do,
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.560]   what we've done in secret time and time again,
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.280]   and how, when we actually think about
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.520]   the ways we hurt each other, the guilt is real.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.200]   And if we do not address our guilt,
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.280]   our guilt becomes shame, it becomes fear,
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.800]   it becomes just, we feel dejected and depressed
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.680]   and to a point where we spiral into these feelings
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.080]   of we're not worthy, we're unlovable,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.240]   to a point where I've done so many terrible things
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.900]   that I'm unforgivable.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:11.000]   And once again, I think about Simon,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.400]   and I wonder, imagine if Jesus comes to your house
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.040]   and he tells you all the things that you haven't done.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   How do you feel?
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.080]   And I think Simon would have been plagued by guilt.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.480]   And so as hard as we try, and I haven't done this yet,
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.040]   I haven't been able to pray away my guilt,
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.620]   I haven't been able to eradicate my guilt,
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.760]   so what I'm trying to say is I think all of us
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.720]   have come to this conclusion that we do not have any power
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.380]   and authority in us to excuse or forgive our guilt,
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.040]   or else there's no need for Jesus to die for us.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.680]   Equally true, I think we've also tried
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.800]   that we cannot get rid of our guilt by our own strength,
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.600]   our own merit, by good discipline, by finding a balance,
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.180]   or having growing more resilience.
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:00.820]   And so Paul, in Romans 7, verse 24, he says,
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.420]   you know, our condition is that we are all a mess
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.900]   and a wretch, and so Paul asks who can rescue us
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.340]   from our sin and overcome this guilt within us.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.240]   So right now, church, rather than think
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.360]   how do we get rid of this guilt,
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.480]   I want to reframe this question to say,
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.880]   church, how can we work at our guilt?
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.280]   How can we offer our Lord the guilt that we feel now?
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.680]   And the question is, are you willing
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.600]   to let go of this guilt?
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.620]   And so I think the starting point here,
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.380]   we can start with Romans 8, one, which says,
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.940]   there is therefore no condemnation
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.800]   to those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.200]   This scripture reminds us that we are no longer condemned
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.480]   because of what Christ has done for us
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.520]   and what we can never do for ourselves.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.920]   Jesus, the only Son of God, he died the most gruesome,
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.720]   violent, and unspeakable death so that
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.520]   we will not be condemned by our guilt,
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.720]   but that we can actually, like this woman,
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.340]   experience a life of freedom,
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.560]   a life where there's no guilt,
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.400]   that guilt is not the leading,
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.080]   the guilt is not a God in our life.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.480]   And so every time when we confess,
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.680]   every time when we come to God with our guilt
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.480]   and everything we've done, rather than being condemned,
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.320]   the Holy Spirit opens up and sets us free.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.120]   So this sinful woman came to Jesus knowing full well
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.480]   that the Lord is not gonna condemn her,
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.720]   but condemn her sins, and that is a matter
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.860]   of difference of life and death.
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:38.560]   And so church, I want us this morning
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.000]   just to think about this one thing,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.420]   and I think this is gonna take you
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.900]   the rest of your life to figure out,
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.160]   but I think it's a good question.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.280]   Regarding our guilt that we feel,
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.640]   we have to ask ourselves, is the guilt
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.560]   that we are feeling right now
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.340]   the conviction of the Holy Spirit,
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.280]   or is the guilt that we feel right now
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.640]   the condemnation of the enemy?
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.560]   Because sometimes we just lop it into, oh, it's all God.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.960]   And when things do not go well,
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.760]   things that cause us pain, we kinda lop it in with God,
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.880]   and so we therefore blame God,
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.400]   and we kinda go down this rabbit hole.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.860]   And some of us don't get out of that until much later,
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.200]   and so I think this question is so key,
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.760]   because God wants to liberate us,
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.440]   he wants to free us and set us free
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.080]   from our sinful nature and our guilt,
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.880]   but at the same time, the enemy's doing everything
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.700]   to keep us condemned and ignorant and in the dark.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.880]   So that's why when we say we don't do church alone,
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.640]   we don't walk alone, this is for the very reason
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.000]   we need one another to check in with each other,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.120]   because we are so easily deceived.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.180]   We live in a world where Satan is the prince.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.400]   He is ruling, he is affecting everything.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.340]   And so, not to get too gloomy,
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.960]   but I want us to be alert and sober-minded
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.760]   so that we can discern God's word, and how do we discern?
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.000]   This is what I would say, that we need the Spirit's help
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   to open up our hearts to what God says is true about us.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.300]   And what is true is that we're forgiven.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.760]   What is true is that we are no longer condemned,
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.840]   and that will allow us to authentically seek God.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.880]   You guys getting this?
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.760]   And so we turn to Jesus because he knows
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.200]   what we need forgiveness for,
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.960]   and that we don't need to struggle alone.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.200]   And I wanna say one more thing about how we can respond,
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.480]   is that guilt can be good news,
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.440]   and it could be a gift and a grace of God to us
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.600]   if we allow it to.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:54.100]   Because our guilt has a potential to get us going
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.280]   in this journey of discovering and being awakened
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.680]   that our sinful nature, our excuses,
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.080]   our guilt keeps us from God.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.760]   And we can choose another way.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.600]   And our guilt makes us aware
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.060]   that God's grace is that amazing,
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.000]   that God's grace is free, that God is merciful,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.440]   and that he's patient because he knows
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.280]   how much we need to be set free.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:24.400]   And so church, if there's one way I could propose
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.200]   that we can respond to everything I'm saying,
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.480]   how do we address our sin, our excuses, our guilt,
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.340]   I would say it's summed up neatly and beautifully
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.040]   in the practice of confession.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.760]   I think churches in general,
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.840]   I don't think we talk about or practice confession
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.000]   as much as we should.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.480]   'Cause I think if we did,
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.600]   we would hear less about pastors failing,
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.420]   we would hear less about relationships breaking down
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.600]   to a point where it would just mitigate.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.660]   If we practiced confession, we would mitigate
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.280]   and Christians wouldn't be in the news
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.340]   for so much globally for scandals.
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:08.460]   And I want to say that if you're just joining right now,
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.060]   if you've just woken up, I want you to hear,
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.960]   this is the most important thing I have to offer.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.560]   James 5, verse 16 says,
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.560]   "Therefore, confess your sins to each other
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.800]   "and pray for each other so that you may be healed."
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.100]   Confession is God's gift to us
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.600]   so that we would no longer be destroyed by our sin,
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.100]   by our excuses, by our guilt.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.980]   He's calling us to grab a brother and sister in Christ
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.020]   because our brother and sister in Christ
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.260]   represents Christ to us.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.780]   And when we go to our brother and sister in Christ,
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.780]   it's like going to God.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.540]   And our brother and sister hears us
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.780]   and we can just be completely open.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.380]   It's like, yes, I am a sinner.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.660]   Yes, by nature, I don't want to do the things I do.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.260]   Yes, all these excuses I want to tell you.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.360]   Can I tell you also all the things I've done
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.420]   because of my guilt?
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:04.740]   And then you pray and the most miraculous thing
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.760]   happens here.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.920]   The reason why we're Christians here
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.480]   is the divine mercy of God and the Holy Spirit
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.200]   comes to us and heals us.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.460]   It's something I cannot explain in theology or in words,
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.280]   but it's what Christianity is all about.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.380]   It's the living God encounter us sinners,
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.000]   but there is another way for us
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.040]   and this is what I'm talking about today.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.900]   In recent years, I have three children.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.220]   I've discovered through my three children
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.460]   that I have road rage even when I'm not driving.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.140]   Seriously, that's, but you know what?
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.100]   I've come to accept that.
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.020]   I'm okay with that.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.160]   It's taken 14 years.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:51.820]   I also just, I am, you know, I worship Jesus
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.740]   and I also worship guilt, I feel like sometimes.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.320]   A lot of what I do is just driven by guilt
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.660]   and I am aware of that.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.080]   I'm okay, I can accept that.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.280]   That's why I'm sharing this with you right now.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:07.280]   And why I bring this up is, well, unfortunately,
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.800]   my wife, my helper or helper auntie, and three children,
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.100]   they're the ones that have to deal with this sin,
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.100]   deal with the excuses every day.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:17.940]   And you know what?
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.360]   The most difficult thing to date is to go to them
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.860]   and ask for their forgiveness.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.820]   You know, when I, before even I do that,
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.460]   I'm paralyzed, I have fear, I make excuses, right?
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.620]   I do not want to ask for forgiveness.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.720]   But yet, at the same time, I know if I don't do this,
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.260]   I will die.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.900]   If I don't ask for forgiveness,
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.840]   even if, forget about asking for forgiveness.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.580]   If I do not confess, I cannot move on with my life.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.100]   And just the possibility for shalom,
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.060]   possibility of reconciliation,
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.040]   I'm gonna bite the bullet and do it.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.880]   But of course, it's so hard, you know, right?
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.760]   It's so hard because confessing,
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.400]   it just requires you to lay out your whole self.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.280]   There is a risk.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.020]   There is a risk that you will be rejected.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.360]   There's a risk that you might be,
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.600]   I might be kicked out of the room for a moment, maybe.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.440]   And it scares me.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.200]   And actually, the scariest thing is,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.520]   what if my children say, "Daddy, I don't forgive you
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.360]   "for this."
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.720]   But,
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:25.340]   I do believe that God works through us, right?
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.860]   He gives us that courage.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.820]   And so I want to share something that my wife said,
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.800]   just a truth bomb.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.640]   It was just beautiful.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.220]   She didn't even know she was saying it.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.780]   But we teach marriage prep course,
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.540]   and the last few weeks, we were talking about
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.620]   the need for forgiveness,
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.020]   the importance of forgiveness and confession.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:42.860]   And she said this.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.940]   Patsy said, "Even if things are dead inside,
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.740]   "forgiveness revives them."
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:55.720]   So, to be a Christian, you cannot grow as a Christian
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.360]   if you do not ever experience forgiveness.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.120]   If you've never asked for forgiveness,
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.460]   you can come here every Sunday.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.640]   You can join all the things that we offer here.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.000]   But if you never experience God's grace in you,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.360]   that leads you to repentance, that leads you to confess,
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.660]   that leads you just to say, "Hey, I'm a sinner
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.920]   "like everyone else."
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.060]   Then you won't grow.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.300]   And I want so much for you to experience this today,
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.520]   and for the rest of your life,
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.960]   and it's gonna take a lot of work,
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.920]   but I think it's worth it.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.840]   And I know I just said that it's hard to describe
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.120]   what this feeling is, and I don't have a theology for it,
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.800]   but I can at least try.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.080]   So when we confess, when we ask for forgiveness,
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.680]   when we come to God, it's surprising.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.400]   You are surprised when your heart feels lighter.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.100]   There is something that shifts in you,
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.720]   and there is an unconventional relief,
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.160]   and a release that you cannot anticipate.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.440]   The moment you say it, the person who you've offended
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.700]   says, "You know what?
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.840]   "We can work with that."
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.740]   You just, something shifts.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.640]   And you know what?
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.200]   Doing this, you will never regret it.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.080]   It's one of those things that as hard as it is,
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.160]   you'll never regret.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.960]   And to confess and to receive forgiveness
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.940]   is like having a pain of a toothache suddenly stop,
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.920]   because that tooth has been removed.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.640]   The numbness has stopped,
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.600]   and you feel that little empty space, and it's awesome.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.780]   You feel the coldness of the ice cream, the warmth of soup.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:30.040]   And of course, all of this is, it will feel unfamiliar,
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.560]   because the world says, "Well, why should I forgive?
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.720]   "Everything is conditional.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.160]   "You treat me well, I'll treat you well."
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.580]   But actually, that is not what the Christian faith is about.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.200]   The Christian faith is anti that.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.380]   It's about walking this narrow road,
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:49.380]   which liberation and freedom, God's presence, is all for us.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:54.740]   So I just want to say, just like Dr. Seuss
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.340]   and Green Eggs and Ham, I ask you to give it a try.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:01.340]   And so, worship team, can I invite you?
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.440]   Thank you so much.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.820]   Church, I know this is difficult,
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:10.020]   and thank you for staying with me,
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.500]   but I feel like it's so important
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.900]   that we recognize today that the journey
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.520]   of forgiveness is a marathon.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.180]   It's gonna take, there's gonna be days
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.460]   where we don't even wanna talk,
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.620]   we don't wanna forgive, that's fine.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.340]   But I want to remind us today that this journey
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.860]   that we walk on together, and you know what?
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.400]   The coolest thing is that when we walk on this journey,
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.540]   when we run, when we feel tired, we encounter Jesus.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.620]   Even when we're not tired, and we're grateful,
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.140]   we encounter Jesus, and everything changes
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.100]   because of what he says to us, that he doesn't condemn us.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.860]   And so, church, I want to also remind us
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.420]   that to grow as a Christian, to grow in revelation
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.960]   as a Christian, is gonna take time.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.460]   And I hope you're okay with that.
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.540]   And lastly, I just want to remind each of us
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:59.140]   how the woman and Simon responded.
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.000]   Because the woman accepted her sinful life
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.020]   for everything that it was.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.860]   She repented and was so grateful to be forgiven.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.020]   The result, the consequence, the reward
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.260]   is that she was free, she was set free.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.060]   And that's why she did what she did.
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:23.260]   Meanwhile, Simon, I think sadly, at least in this account,
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.180]   he remained in a bit of a darkness.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.600]   He was unable to be fully alive
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.740]   because his sin kept him, his excuses,
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.140]   maybe the guilt held him back from just saying,
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.020]   Lord, just have everything.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.600]   And so, church, I want to ask you to stand.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:45.020]   And my only prayer for us right now
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.420]   is that you and I would have the courage
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.620]   to come to Jesus just as this sinful woman did.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:59.780]   And also for us to say, Lord, forgive me as I am, like Simon.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.660]   And so right now, I just, maybe you can close your eyes,
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.700]   maybe you can sit down if you want,
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.180]   maybe if you want to kneel,
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.020]   maybe you want to open up your hands.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:18.820]   Earlier, I encouraged you to just have that courage
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:22.280]   to allow God to show you just that one thing.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.940]   Perhaps it's the one thing,
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.740]   there's a sin in your life that is holding you back
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.320]   from receiving forgiveness.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.700]   Perhaps today you realize that there's been this one thing
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.420]   I just kept on telling myself,
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:43.780]   this lie, this excuse, God is just showing you what that is.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.500]   Or maybe for you, like me,
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.380]   it's just this incessant guilt at work,
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.260]   constantly in my life, leading me down paths
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.420]   I'd rather not go.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.360]   Whatever it is, Lord, you know.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.500]   And so we're not gonna excuse ourselves right now,
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.400]   we're just gonna sit here,
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.060]   we're gonna stand here and we're gonna say,
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:10.260]   Holy Spirit, have your way with our sin.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.480]   Take our sin, Lord God, forgive our sin.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.540]   Lord, we don't need to tell you how sick we are, you know.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:25.700]   Thank you for accepting me for who I am right now,
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.940]   but Holy Spirit, come in your fullness
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.660]   and your gentleness and love and show me
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.340]   and renew me, restore me, heal me, Lord.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:38.340]   And Jesus, we ask you for the rest of our life,
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.600]   would you give us the courage to address at full on,
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.100]   look at our guilt, look at our shame.
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.960]   We are worthy because of what you've done on the cross.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.960]   We are forgiven, we are restored, thank you, Lord,
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.300]   and because of this right now,
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.600]   like this woman, we're just gonna worship you.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.520]   We are gonna choose to worship you
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.480]   because the reality is that we are uncondemned
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.160]   and we are forgiven and you say
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.960]   that we can go in peace right now.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.880]   And so give us courage to walk
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.120]   and run this marathon together.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.240]   While Satan would want to keep us in the dark,
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.740]   Jesus, we run to you in the light right now.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.240]   We weep at your feet, Lord God, we anoint you with oil,
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.320]   we praise you with our mouth and our bodies and our lives
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.880]   and the decisions we make, Lord, this is where we're at.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   So church, right now, I just want to call you to worship,
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.620]   call you to repent.
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.440]   I want you invite you to just confess
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.920]   because this is what God wants for us.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.760]   This is God's will for us, if you would ask.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.960]   So let us worship together, let us respond.
