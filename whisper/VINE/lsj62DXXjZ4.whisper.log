[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   In Jesus' name, we bless this.
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.500]   Amen.
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.340]   (congregation applauding)
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.540]   Hey, before we do anything, before you sit down,
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.340]   before you sit down, I wanna lean into this sense of faith
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.380]   a little bit more.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.940]   Today's an exciting day in the history of the Vine.
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.580]   We're having our first formal services in Yuen Long
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.580]   in the new location that you guys have given
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.180]   so faithfully towards.
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.620]   Pastor Ivan and Pastor Tim,
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.860]   the Cantonese service started at 9.30, that's already done.
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.260]   The English service is happening right now.
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.900]   They're gathering there for the first time
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.060]   in their new building.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.060]   We went in on Wednesday night, a group of us,
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.600]   and we prayed and dedicated that space.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.200]   It's happening right now.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.280]   And let's pray in faith that God will do something
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.580]   that only God can do through that new community,
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.940]   that new church that's planted there.
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.340]   So would you pray with me?
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.180]   Let's pray.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.480]   Father, we thank you so much for what you're doing
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.120]   in the life of Yuen Long and all the things
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.920]   that are on your heart for the people of Yuen Long.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.920]   And Lord, you've called the Vine to plant a church there.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.720]   To plant a church there, to express something
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.160]   of your gospel, of justice, of hope and life there.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.100]   And Father, as they're gathering in Ho Shin Lee building
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.140]   for the first time, their permanent home
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.140]   after all the renovations and all the fundraising
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.740]   that we've done, they're literally breaking ground.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.040]   They're there right now.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.880]   Father, we wanna pray that you would release
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.640]   a spirit of anointing upon that community.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.920]   Father, we pray that you would bring salvations
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.440]   in the house today.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.140]   Lord, we pray that people that don't know you
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.920]   would come into this church and discover a God
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.720]   who has set them free.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.020]   Lord, we pray that everything we've been talking about here
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.760]   in the Exodus series would overflow, Lord,
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.460]   into the life of that community
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.760]   and that they would lean forward towards society around them
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.200]   with the hope of the gospel.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.040]   Lord, we pray for Tim and Ivan as they lead that community.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.240]   We ask that you would fill them with your power.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.880]   And Lord, we pray you would speak to them
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.940]   in ways that they've never experienced before,
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.040]   that you would give them an extra anointing, Lord,
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.720]   for the new season that they're in.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.440]   And Father, we stand with this community.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.360]   They're a part of us.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.560]   It is our expression here in the city.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.840]   So we fan into flame everything that you're doing
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.920]   in that space.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.760]   And we are looking forward to hearing the testimonies
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.560]   of the goodness of God in the land of the living.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.960]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.800]   Everyone says?
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.640]   Amen.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.540]   Can we thank the worship team?
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.380]   They're gone.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.620]   (congregation applauding)
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.460]   They're gone.
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.240]   All right, have a seat, have a seat.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.840]   Hey, if I was to ask you this morning,
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.880]   what is the most spiritual act
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.540]   that a Christian can engage in?
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.320]   I wonder what you would say.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.680]   What is the most spiritual act
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.000]   that a Christian can engage in?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.960]   I wonder what would be on your heart for that.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.040]   Some of you in here would probably say prayer.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.080]   Prayer is the most Christian thing that we can do.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.320]   When we pray, we're connecting ourselves to God
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.240]   and we're allowing God to speak to us.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.300]   Prayer is the most spiritual act a Christian could do.
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.000]   Some of you here might say worship.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.920]   I mean, we just had a phenomenal worship experience here
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.320]   within our community in this moment.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.680]   Maybe for you, worship is the most spiritual thing
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.280]   that you think you can do.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.980]   For some of you here, it might be reading the Bible.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.620]   Maybe it's your daily devotions.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.080]   That's the place where you feel
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.440]   like you're most spiritually connected to God.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.720]   For some of you, maybe it's coming to church.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.560]   For a lot of you, I hope it's coming to church
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.980]   where you think that that is something that is spiritual.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.040]   The most spiritual thing you could do
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.320]   is gather together with people on a Sunday
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.000]   in a room like this or in a small community,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.640]   a community group somewhere in the city
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.120]   and believe that God is gonna do things.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.720]   Maybe that is the most spiritual thing.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.560]   All of those things are absolutely spiritual
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.960]   and all of those things are incredibly valuable,
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.080]   but I want you to notice something.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.760]   Every single one of those things
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.640]   is dependent on one other thing first.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.960]   All of those things, as spiritual and as great as they are,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.120]   are actually dependent on one other thing
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.180]   that not only defines those things,
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.020]   but drives those things forward in your life,
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.260]   and that is the power of choice.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.020]   You have to choose to do those things.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.060]   You have to choose to pray.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.660]   You have to choose to open your Bible and read the Word.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.100]   You have to choose to come to church.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.680]   Hopefully you chose to come to church.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.740]   Hopefully nobody forced you to come to church today.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.580]   Hopefully you chose to be here.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.780]   We have to choose to do those things.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.260]   And here's the thing, if we don't choose them,
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.500]   if we're forced to do them,
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.740]   then we're in slavery and not in freedom.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.980]   Are you with me?
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.400]   In fact, the very definition of slavery
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.300]   is that choice is taken away from you.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.180]   The very definition of freedom
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.380]   is that you have the freedom to choose.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.900]   And last week, as we unpacked the idea
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.400]   that God had finally set Israel free,
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.940]   that Pharaoh had finally allowed Israel
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.100]   to move into their freedom,
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.300]   we saw that the very first thing
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.080]   that they were challenged with was to make a choice.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.100]   They had to make the choice
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.020]   whether they were gonna move into their freedom,
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.700]   leaving Pharaoh and Egypt behind them,
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.660]   or whether they were gonna move into their freedom,
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.060]   carrying the pain and the hurt
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.900]   and the travesty of the oppression
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.860]   that had happened for them for over 200 years.
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.180]   And God challenges them, doesn't He?
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.540]   He says, "Will you bless Pharaoh?
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.820]   "Will you let go of the very one
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.400]   "who has caused you so much pain
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.320]   "so that you can walk into your freedom,
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.620]   "into your future, facing forwards?"
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.740]   I said last week that so often for many of us,
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.700]   when we're hold to the hurt and the pain of our past,
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.860]   it's like we're walking into our future facing backwards.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.100]   We're allowing the hurt and the pain of our past
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.900]   to be the primary thing that defines our present
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.300]   and moves us forward into our future.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.920]   And we saw last week that there was a tool
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.180]   that God gives us to release the pain of our past
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.860]   so that we can move into our future,
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.740]   not looking back to the past,
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.260]   but embracing the future.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.060]   And that is the power of choice,
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.300]   the choice to forgive,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.780]   the choice to open our hearts
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.020]   and forgive and to bless the ones who have hurt us
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.020]   and done these things to us
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.620]   so that we might be free,
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.180]   free from the pain, free from the hurt,
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.100]   free from anything that would try to hold us back
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.380]   from the good future that we have.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.500]   You see, your ability to choose,
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.680]   to choose the future over your past,
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.780]   to choose faith over fear
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.100]   will be the primary defining ground
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.500]   of whether you will experience great freedom in your life
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.100]   or whether you will remain in slavery.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.780]   The most spiritual thing you can do is to choose God,
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.740]   to choose to worship, to choose to honor,
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.780]   to choose to open your heart,
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.340]   to choose to create your future
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.380]   rather than be consumed by your past.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.220]   And here's the amazing thing.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.060]   Pretty much every moment,
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.460]   every story of great faith in the Bible
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.060]   is a story and a moment that emerges
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.940]   out of the epic intersection in life
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.800]   where God has driven his people to a point of decision.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.940]   So many of the great stories in our scriptures of faith
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.500]   where men and women show great faith,
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   it's because God has put them in a place
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.180]   where they have to make a decision.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.420]   Will we go forward?
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.340]   Decide for yourself today who you will serve.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.980]   Will you serve God or will you serve something else?
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.100]   But you've got to make that decision today.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.380]   Decide to move into your future facing forwards
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.300]   or decide to carry on with the hurt
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.660]   and the past of your past.
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.980]   It's a choice to have faith or to walk in fear.
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.900]   And it is exactly,
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.300]   exactly what the narrative
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.140]   of the parting of the Red Sea is all about.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.860]   Your ability to choose
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.780]   is the most spiritual activity you will ever do.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:47.180]   And as God has freed Israel from their slavery,
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.060]   Israel is now in a new season.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.340]   Israel's now in a season
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.340]   where no longer are choices being made for them.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.940]   And they now have to take responsibility
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.620]   for their own lives.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.300]   They have the grand responsibility
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.900]   to walk out into their freedom with hope and with desire.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.540]   The freedom to choose whether they'll serve God or not.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.380]   And in this freedom,
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.420]   God realizes that after 200 years of slavery,
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.500]   their choice muscles,
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.940]   their spiritual activity of choosing is weak.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.180]   They understand that they've had all their choices
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.940]   stripped away from them for so long
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.860]   that now that they're free,
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.700]   it's easy for them to be overwhelmed
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.780]   with the reality of the choices that are in front of them.
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.540]   And God understands that they don't have the strength
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.940]   right now to be able to make the choices
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.860]   that they need to make
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.580]   to walk in the freedom that God has for them.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.140]   And so what God does right in the early part
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.260]   of Pharaoh releasing Israel into their new freedom journey,
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.220]   what God does is he leads them into a number of places
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.900]   where he brings them to a point of decision
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.540]   because he wants to strengthen that muscle in them.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.780]   He wants them, it's almost as if he creates a training ground
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.420]   like a bootcamp for them every step of the way
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.580]   early on in their walk of freedom
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.780]   because he wants to strengthen within them their desire
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.100]   to say, we are always gonna choose God,
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.340]   we're gonna choose faith, we're gonna choose hope,
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.660]   no matter how hard something looks,
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.580]   that's what we're gonna do.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.500]   And God actually directs his people into places
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.620]   where fear is gonna be a reality for them,
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.820]   where they're going to have to decide
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.820]   are they going to respond in fear or respond in faith?
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:36.020]   And you need to know that in every aspect of freedom
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.900]   that God has for you,
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.620]   there's always going to be the potentiality
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.780]   for you to choose fear,
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.500]   for you to choose to return to slavery,
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.380]   for you to choose to hold on to that past.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.580]   And so the most spiritual activity you will ever do
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.620]   is choose faith.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.060]   And I want to show you how God brings his people
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.220]   into situations that will strengthen this muscle
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.780]   of choosing faith.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.180]   Is this okay so far?
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.380]   Everybody all right?
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.060]   Exodus 13, verse 17.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.060]   When Pharaoh let the people go,
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.340]   God did not lead them, notice this,
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.220]   God did not lead them on the road
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.660]   through the Philistine country,
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.900]   even though that was shorter.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.740]   I love this.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.660]   God was like, okay, you're free now.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.060]   And as the crow flies, you should go on this path
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.500]   'cause it'll get you to the fullness
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.780]   of your freedom quickest,
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.460]   but I'm not gonna lead you down that path.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.460]   He doesn't choose to take them
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.020]   to the place that was shorter.
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.940]   For God said, if they face war,
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.220]   they might change their minds and return to Egypt.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.700]   So God led the people around by the desert road
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.820]   towards the Red Sea.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.620]   The Israelites went up out of Egypt, armed for the battle.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.380]   I want you to see what God's doing here.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.380]   He understands that the Israelites actually need
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.020]   to strengthen their choice muscles.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.660]   That is very weak right now.
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.740]   And so rather than take them in the direct line,
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.780]   the shortest route, the easiest route
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.620]   that would take them through the Philistine country,
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.740]   He actually then leads them on the desert road,
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.500]   a circular route that's actually,
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.580]   and we'll see this in a moment,
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.620]   is gonna lead them to a place where they get trapped.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.580]   Lead them to a place where they're gonna have
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.660]   the Red Sea in front of them,
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.420]   and behind them there are gonna be mountains
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.460]   and a flat plain, and on those mountains,
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.820]   they're gonna see the Egyptian armies
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.820]   rushing after them to kill them,
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.180]   and they're gonna feel trapped,
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.020]   and they're gonna feel fear.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.860]   And before any of that happens,
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.920]   scriptures tell us that God leads them to that point.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.580]   He leads them to that point 'cause He knows it's there
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.020]   that they're going to be able to make a choice.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.700]   And that choice is gonna so strengthen them
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.660]   for all the journey and all the battle that is ahead.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.780]   He actually says that if they face war,
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.500]   there might change their minds.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.660]   Their minds are weak right now.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.860]   And if they face war, they might change their minds
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.900]   and go back to Egypt.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.180]   I need to bring them to a place
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.460]   where they're gonna be scared,
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.140]   a place where they're gonna face fear,
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.100]   a place where they think they're going to die
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.860]   'cause I'm gonna lay before them a choice,
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.860]   and if they can choose faith over fear in that moment,
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.860]   it's gonna so strengthen them
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.660]   that they're gonna be able to walk strongly
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.300]   towards Mount Sinai, strongly to the promised land,
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.800]   and they're gonna be able to do all the things
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.140]   that I have for them to do in the future.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.860]   Are you following this?
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.140]   This is really important.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.500]   Because God is committed to you being free
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.980]   more than he's committed to you being comfortable.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.740]   Oh, nobody wants me to preach on that one.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.140]   God is committed to you being free
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.660]   more than he's committed to you being comfortable.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.420]   And he recognizes that sometimes
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.820]   in order to get you fully free,
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.860]   he needs to strengthen your decision muscles,
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.940]   your choice muscles,
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.340]   and that means you're gonna be put into a place
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.100]   where you're gonna have to make a decision yourself
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.620]   whether you're gonna respond in fear or respond in faith.
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.860]   And God moves us in life sometimes
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.980]   towards things like a Red Sea
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.940]   in order to help us to understand
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.540]   that before we can get to the promised land,
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.420]   we have to actually face this thing right in front of us.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.060]   See, this is the thing I love about God.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.060]   God has all of your life in his mind,
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.900]   all of your life in his hands.
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.780]   He sees your future,
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.500]   and he sees the battles that are ahead of you
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.300]   on the path that you are yet to walk on.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.820]   He sees all that.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.060]   And so right here and right now,
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.500]   he is preparing you, shaping you,
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.340]   strengthening you, helping you
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.020]   to be prepared as best you can
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.340]   for those battles that are ahead.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.060]   And if he doesn't do it now,
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.620]   you're not gonna have the fortitude,
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.780]   the hope, and the courage, and the bravery
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.300]   to really stand before the battle that's ahead.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.340]   And the battle ahead is probably gonna be more challenging
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.940]   than the one you're currently facing.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.140]   And if you're anything like me,
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.980]   the challenge that's right ahead of you now
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.980]   seems totally the biggest thing you're ever gonna face.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.540]   And God's like, "You want to go ahead
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.660]   "into the promised land,
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.060]   "but you're not even ready to face the Red Sea."
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.780]   It's so interesting.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.140]   They want their freedom,
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.060]   but they're not quite ready for the reality
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.300]   of what they need to strengthen.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.860]   They need to strengthen their faith.
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.180]   Some of you here right now,
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.020]   you're facing an obstacle in your life.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.580]   And what you think is the obstacle
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.620]   that God is absent from
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.940]   is actually the very thing he's brought you to
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.460]   so that you would have the strength of resilience,
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.720]   and fortitude, and courage, and faith
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.900]   to face the other battle down the road
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.860]   that you're not even yet aware of.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.780]   'Cause he cares for your freedom
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.300]   more than whether you're comfortable,
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.180]   whether you're right, whether you feel good.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.580]   And he wants all those things for you too,
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.060]   don't hear me wrong.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.460]   But the primary thing he wants is you to be so strengthened
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.780]   that you will be able to experience
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.580]   all the freedom he has for you.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.740]   Are you following me?
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.180]   Now, notice here what happens with Israel.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.300]   I love this bit.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.260]   It says at the end here,
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.620]   "The Israelites went up out of Egypt armed for battle."
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.460]   I love this.
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.600]   You see, Egypt is dressed for war.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.020]   They're dressed for battle,
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.300]   but they're not ready for battle.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.300]   God doesn't see them as being ready for battle.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.220]   They might be dressed in all the right things.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.580]   They might have the armor on.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.020]   They might have the sword in their hands,
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.340]   but God leads them away from the war
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.060]   because he knows that if they go there,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.900]   they're gonna get defeated.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.580]   Their minds are not strong enough yet.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.980]   And so although they're dressed for the battle,
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.060]   God knows they're not ready for the battle.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.460]   And because they're not ready for the battle,
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.060]   he's gonna actually move them into a place
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.420]   where they can actually get prepared.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.460]   You see, they think that what they need is the armor
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.660]   and the sword for the battle that's ahead of them.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.040]   Actually, the battle that they really need to fight
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.980]   is the battle of choice.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.700]   It's actually a battle within them.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.740]   Are they going to choose faith
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.440]   or are they gonna choose fear?
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.060]   That's the true battle before them.
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.220]   No amount of armor and no amount of physical sword
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.920]   is ever gonna help them to wield the one weapon,
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.480]   the one sword that will truly set them free,
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.300]   and that's their faith in God.
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.900]   Some of you here right now
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.420]   are facing some huge battles in your life,
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.480]   massive obstacles that you're trying to overcome.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.020]   And I wanna say this.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.220]   You're facing a massive battle,
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.400]   but you're dressed for the wrong war.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.960]   You're currently dressed for the wrong battle.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.900]   You're dressed for a battle
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.060]   that God doesn't want you to fight
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.420]   and not one that he's asking you to be involved in.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.620]   Some of us in here, we're dressed
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.940]   with all the right arguments to prove to that colleague
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.700]   or that spouse or that friend or that family member
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.540]   that they are wrong and you are right.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.660]   Some of you in here are dressed with all the right skills
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.500]   to overcome whatever adversity you think it is
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.340]   that you're facing.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.380]   You're dressed with all the charm that you think you need
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.900]   to convince that person that you're dating
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.800]   to marry you for the rest of your life.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.500]   And you're dressed for the wrong battle
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.240]   because your battle is not external to you.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.820]   It is not outside of you.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.820]   Your battle ultimately is in your heart.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.620]   Your battle is what's inside here.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.360]   It's the decision-making powerhouse that you have.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.460]   Your battle is whether you're gonna respond in faith
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.920]   and trust God with your life,
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.420]   not whether you have all the right arguments
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.060]   to defeat the person that's against you.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.340]   It's whether you really trust that God has you,
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.460]   has you in His hands, wants the best for you,
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.140]   whether you can trust that no matter how difficult
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.060]   that thing is at work, God has got you, He protects you,
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.700]   He will help you, He will walk with you,
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.940]   and He'll fight battles for you.
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.220]   That's the battle for you.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.260]   And the one that He wants you dressed for
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.000]   is not the external one with swords,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.980]   but the internal one with humility and courage
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.220]   and bravery and faith.
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.380]   That's the battle.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.940]   That's the battle that was ahead for Israel.
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.420]   That's the battle that's ahead for you.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:44.420]   Will you choose Him when everything around you
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.340]   would tell you you're an idiot if you do it?
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.040]   This is exactly what the parting of the Red Sea
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:52.980]   is all about.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.580]   This is what is on God's heart for His people.
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.740]   And I want you to understand the movement
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.720]   of the human heart that God is trying to do
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.740]   through this incredible miracle.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.600]   And to help you with that, I wanna take you back to Egypt,
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.580]   and I wanna take you to the actual place
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.700]   where we believe the miracle happened.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.940]   Let's have a look at this.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:22.320]   - Israel's journey had begun.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.000]   Finally released by Pharaoh,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.740]   God leads Israel by the desert road towards the Red Sea.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.640]   You can imagine a mixture of excitement and trepidation
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.940]   as they begin those first few steps.
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.280]   God has performed a series of miracles
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.020]   to get Israel to this point,
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.020]   and their faith and expectancy in God
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.700]   would have been very high.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.740]   And yet they were also launching out into the unknown
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.260]   with many uncertainties facing them.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.740]   Like the mountains that now rose up around them
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.340]   and the desert valleys that now surrounded them,
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.180]   they're no doubt expected to encounter great highs
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.780]   and great lows in their journey with God
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.500]   as He has released them from their captivity.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.880]   They just didn't know that those highs and lows
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.360]   would happen so quickly.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.460]   The Bible tells us that some 600,000 men and women,
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.420]   aside from children, set out for the promised land.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.140]   In fact, biblical scholars would say
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.060]   that the total number of God's people
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.100]   at the start of the Exodus was around about a million.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.140]   Could you imagine a million people walking through valleys
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.660]   just like the one behind me?
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.900]   And they were heading in the direction of a place
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.500]   that in the Hebrew was called Yom Suf,
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.060]   which literally translates as the Sea of the Reeds.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.920]   And in what is perhaps one of the most famous
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.620]   misinterpretations in all of history,
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.260]   the writers of the first Greek Old Testament in Alexandria
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.500]   in about the third century BC
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.020]   translated that phrase as the Red Sea,
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.780]   the name that we now commonly refer to it.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.220]   No one knows exactly where the crossing actually took place,
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.300]   but a number of sites have been suggested
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.020]   based on the closest biblical analysis of the text
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.220]   and the corresponding Egyptian geographical landmarks.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.540]   We know from Exodus 14 that the Israelites
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.020]   had just come through a system
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.100]   of narrow mountains and valleys
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.120]   that then had opened up into a large plain on the shore
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.980]   just before a big sea.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.180]   We also know that the crossing point itself
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.180]   had to be shallow enough for the Israelites
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.300]   to be able to walk through once God had parted the waters
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.540]   and smooth enough for the Egyptian chariots
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.720]   to attempt to follow.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.740]   All of which is why I've come here
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.020]   to a place called Neweber Beach on the Sinai Peninsula.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.500]   The mountains and valleys behind me here,
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.020]   this massive flat plain all around me,
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.100]   and the relatively shallow waters of the sea
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.220]   just over there all point to this as a possible location
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.340]   for the greatest miracle in our Exodus story itself,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.680]   the parting of the Red Sea.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   But did it really happen?
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.600]   I mean, is the parting of the Red Sea just mythology?
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.220]   Or is there any actual archeological evidence
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.720]   that it took place?
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.820]   Well, as I've been saying throughout this series,
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.720]   there's very little archeological evidence in Egypt
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.020]   of the actual Exodus events.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.660]   But the parting of the Red Sea
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.420]   is one miracle that keeps on giving
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.620]   because it is one of the very few things
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.700]   in the Exodus story that actually is recorded for us
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.720]   in Egyptian history.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.060]   And to show us that,
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.260]   I now need to take us back across the Sinai Peninsula
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.140]   to a place called Ismailia on the port of the Suez Canal
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.300]   and to an archeological evidence
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.020]   that is unlike any other in this land.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.600]   (gentle music)
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:45.960]   This is the El Irish stone.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.480]   It's a slab of black granite that weighs about two tons
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.840]   and was discovered on a farm in El Irish in 1887.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.640]   Now, when it was actually found,
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.880]   it was lying on its side being used
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.080]   as a water trough for cattle,
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.680]   but it's actually a family shrine.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.360]   It dates to about 360 years before Christ.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.460]   But what's really fascinating for us
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.080]   is that it's covered in thousands of inscriptions.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.800]   And these inscriptions actually tell a story
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.680]   that's about 1200 years earlier
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.280]   than when the shrine was made.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.380]   Now, let me show you one particular inscription.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.040]   It's found here at the back.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.360]   Right here, what you'll see is three waves
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.380]   and two daggers or swords, three waves and two swords.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.040]   Now, Egyptologists are somewhat confused
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   as to the best way to translate this,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.380]   but a literal way seems the smartest.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.640]   In other words, it's the cutting of the sea,
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.000]   the cutting of the sea.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.520]   Now, also included here is an Egyptian name for a place.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.360]   It's Pehati in the Egyptian,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.040]   but it's actually in the Hebrew, Pi-Ha-Choreath.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.940]   And that's actually the very place
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.000]   where Israel camped before God parted the Red Sea.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.460]   So what really fascinates me
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.320]   is that this is so rare in all of antiquities
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.020]   because this is the cutting of the sea
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.200]   shown from an Egyptian perspective.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.140]   The only thing we have in existence
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.480]   where we have a commentary on the Exodus
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.680]   from the perspective of Pharaoh,
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.640]   which actually makes this stone a miracle of a miracle.
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.200]   (gentle music)
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.980]   It actually fascinates me that we have both Jewish
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.240]   and Egyptian sources for the parting of the Red Sea.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.860]   But for me, a question still remains.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.800]   What exactly was God trying to teach his people
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.400]   through this miracle?
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.240]   Well, to find an answer for that,
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.780]   I wanna take us back now to the waters of the Red Sea itself.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.520]   (water sloshing)
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.100]   (gentle music)
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:24:03.900]   I haven't actually tried to part these waters just yet,
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.700]   but being here and standing in this place
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.060]   is actually really emotional for me.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.180]   I mean, this may well be the very place
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.900]   that Moses stretched out his hands and the waters parted,
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.660]   and they crossed to the mountains
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.220]   that are over here on the other side.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.780]   But there's another emotion
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.260]   that was there for Israel on that day.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.300]   I mean, prior to Moses stretching out his hands,
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.640]   they felt incredibly trapped in this place.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.140]   They had just gathered here
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.180]   and they'd come up against the waters
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.420]   and they knew that the Egyptians were chasing after them.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.140]   In fact, as I stand here with the waters behind me,
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.700]   I look back to the mountains just over there,
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.340]   I can picture what it would have been like
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.800]   to have 600 Egyptian chariots coming down those mountains,
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.260]   coming through the valleys, chasing towards them.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.860]   They would have felt hemmed in
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.040]   and that anxiety and fear
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.200]   would have been such a critical part of that moment.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.840]   In fact, it was so strong that they come to Moses
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.820]   and they complained bitterly to him.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.260]   They say, "Why are we gonna come to die on the beach here?
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.140]   "We should have stayed in Egypt if we were gonna die."
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.980]   And so despite the natural beauty of this place,
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.620]   actually the geography here
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.120]   just communicated to them death.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.740]   What we need to remember here
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.420]   is that none of this was a surprise to God.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.300]   In fact, in Exodus 14,
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.140]   we see that God hardens Pharaoh's heart.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.380]   God hardens his heart so that he would drive
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.700]   after the Israelites, chase them to this very place.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.500]   I mean, God wanted Israel to be here, to feel trapped,
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.100]   to feel that fear inside them,
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.940]   to know that it would be impossible for them to go forward
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.420]   unless God stepped in and did a miracle.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.780]   And he wanted this because his desire
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.660]   was to expose the content of their hearts.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.820]   He was kind of leaning into his people
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.100]   and saying, "What's really actually inside of you?"
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.140]   And this teaches us a critical thing here
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.100]   in the Exodus story.
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.000]   You see, the Exodus is not actually so much
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.300]   about a physical movement from one place to the next,
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.260]   but a different kind of movement,
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.300]   the movement that actually happens in the human heart.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.980]   - When I woke up this morning and got dressed,
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.540]   I didn't realize I put the same pants on
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.460]   that I was wearing in the film on that day.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.940]   The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:23.260]   I wanna show you this movement of the human heart
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.020]   because it's important for you.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.420]   It's important for your own movement
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.180]   in your story of Exodus and the freedom
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.980]   that God longs for you.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.060]   And we see that movement happen in the physical movement
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.500]   of God's people in the story.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.320]   So I wanna just unpack that briefly with you.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.220]   Verse 10 of Exodus 14 says this,
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.100]   "As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.100]   and there were the Egyptians marching after them."
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.700]   So again, the story is you got the mountains behind them,
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.700]   that big flat plain you saw in the film,
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.300]   the waters that you saw in the film,
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.460]   they're up against the waters,
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.620]   they're looking back to the mountains
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.380]   and they see the Egyptians marching after them.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.180]   Notice what happens, "They were terrified
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.820]   and cried out to the Lord.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.380]   They said to Moses, 'Was it because there were no graves
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.340]   in Egypt that you brought us to this desert to die?
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.500]   What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.140]   Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone,
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.420]   let us serve the Egyptians?'
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.780]   It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.340]   than to die in the desert."
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.860]   This is a classic response
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.020]   and you can understand why Israel responds this way.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.900]   'Cause they think they've come to a dead end.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.580]   And they've got the sea behind them,
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.660]   they've got the mountains in front of them,
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.940]   they've got the Egyptian armies,
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.020]   could you imagine what it'd be like?
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.980]   600 chariots rushing down those valleys,
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.460]   rushing towards them and all of God's people
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.100]   are crying out to Moses and they're saying,
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.720]   "This was not what we had in mind.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.800]   This is not what we thought freedom was like.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.300]   We thought freedom was gonna be perfect,
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.200]   freedom was gonna be great.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.320]   Oh, we wanted the promised land,
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.040]   but we weren't prepared for this thing right here.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.540]   Why did you bring us out of our slavery
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.380]   to bring us to a point where we die in the desert?
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.780]   This doesn't make sense."
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.220]   Which I think is so easy for all of us to say
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.340]   when we're in a journey of freedom,
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.980]   when we're moving from one thing to the next
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.600]   and when we come up against an obstacle
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.820]   as big as the Red Sea
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.400]   and we come up with something that seems like
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.380]   we can't get around it, we can't get through it,
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.440]   we don't know what to do with it,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.700]   we think this is the end for us.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.980]   And what they thought Israel was the end for them
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.500]   was actually the very thing
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.740]   that was gonna provide what they needed
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.240]   for the journey ahead, as I've been saying.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.940]   You see, so often in our journeys of freedom,
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.900]   we want God's outcome, but we don't want his process.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.080]   God's about to do this incredible miracle and split the sea
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.120]   and they're about to walk into their freedom
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.580]   and they have no idea right now
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.220]   and instead what they see is an obstacle
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.620]   that God sees as the process by which
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.640]   they're going to strengthen their muscle to decide faith.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.900]   But in this moment, they decide fear.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.200]   Notice actually what they say, they say quite clearly.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.740]   They say, "It would have been better for us
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.280]   "to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert."
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.300]   In other words, they've already made a choice.
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.480]   The first obstacle they come up against in their freedom,
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.160]   they make a choice and that choice is to go backwards.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.460]   That choice is to move back towards their slavery.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.680]   They're like, "We would rather have slavery
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.520]   "than this situation we're in right now.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.300]   "We're up against this water, we're up against this trap.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.660]   "We feel like we're trapped in here.
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   "We don't know what to do."
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.540]   The choice we're going to make is we're gonna go backwards
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.440]   because at least there's some comfort in slavery.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.740]   We don't know what's ahead of us.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.880]   This is really important, church,
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.380]   'cause when we're moving in the choice of faith,
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.580]   faith means you don't have certainty.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.560]   Come on, church, I'm gonna preach on this one.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.040]   Faith means you don't have certainty.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.600]   You don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.520]   You don't know what's gonna happen with that sea.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.680]   You don't know if it's gonna part.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.920]   You don't know if it's gonna change.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.040]   You have uncertainty.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.440]   That's why you have to choose faith.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.880]   If you want certainty, go back to slavery
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.200]   'cause there you know what it's like.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.400]   You know what the oppression is.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.560]   You know how bad it is.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.640]   And that's what Israel's saying.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.200]   They're saying, "I don't want the uncertainty
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.840]   "of an unknown future.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.380]   "I would rather take the safety and the comfort
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.580]   "of a bad situation even if it's terrible for me."
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.880]   Let me preach on this for a second.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.440]   Some of you wonder why you're still
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.900]   in that really bad relationship you're in.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.680]   It's because you're so afraid of being lonely
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.060]   in your future that you are happy
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.820]   to accept a terrible relationship today.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.760]   Some of you are wondering,
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.720]   why am I still in the job that I'm in
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.360]   when God for a long time has been calling you
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.200]   to something different?
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.500]   And perhaps it's because you're so afraid
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.220]   of the uncertainty of your future,
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.340]   whether you're gonna be able to provide
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.080]   for your family or not,
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.920]   but you'd rather stay in the comfort
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.720]   of a job that's killing you.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.600]   Come on, church.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.600]   And so here's Israel, and they're in a place of decision.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.960]   God has put them in that place, ordained it for them,
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.080]   and it's not comfortable.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.560]   It's not easy.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.540]   And they are deciding out of fear to go backwards.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.920]   That's the choice that they're making.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.720]   They wanna go backwards.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.120]   And so that's what they're saying.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.960]   They're saying, "We'd rather take this than that."
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.760]   I love one of my favorite pastors,
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.520]   Erwin McManus, a church called Mosaic in LA.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.400]   He said it this way, and I love this.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.560]   He says, "We so often would rather accept the comfort
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.160]   "and safety of a past that holds us captive
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.400]   "than the mystery and uncertainty
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.380]   "of a future that sets us free."
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.700]   That, my friends, is what the Exodus is all about.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.800]   That's the thing that we have to try to break
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.600]   through the muscle that we have to choose faith over fear,
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.320]   to choose the uncertain and the unknown,
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.920]   the belief that God will be there,
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.880]   that He will provide, that we'll lean into that.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.560]   We gotta choose that uncertain future
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.200]   over the comfort that comes from the brokenness
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.640]   of our past, and whether we will decide that
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.880]   will determine our freedom,
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.640]   and that's why God's brought them here.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.540]   Now, notice what Moses now responds with.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.320]   I love this in verse 15.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.780]   Moses answers the people, "Do not be afraid.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.900]   "Stand firm, and you will see the deliverance
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.480]   "that the Lord will bring you today."
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.800]   The Egyptians you see today will never be seen again.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.360]   The Lord will fight for you.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.560]   You only need to be still.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.280]   The Hebrew word be still here means literally
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.600]   to root yourself in, to dig yourself in.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.960]   Now, this is really interesting
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.260]   because when Scripture uses this phrase be still,
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.960]   we often think it's because we have too much activity,
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.320]   too much desire, too much things going on.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.000]   We use this a lot in Hong Kong.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   One of the great calls for Hong Kong is to be still
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.540]   and know that God is God,
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.680]   because in Hong Kong we're busy, we're active,
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.720]   we're always doing stuff,
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.120]   and sometimes God needs to come and say,
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.920]   "Just chill out, rest, get to know me more."
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.160]   That's not what's going on here,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.760]   because Israel's not all bustling with activity,
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.680]   wanting to drive ahead, and God's gotta go,
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.480]   "Slow down, otherwise you're gonna get ahead of me."
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.860]   That's not what's happening here.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.340]   What's happening is that Israel wants to go backwards.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.760]   They wanna go back to the pain of their past
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.000]   rather than move into the future,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.960]   and because they're choosing to move backwards,
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.000]   Moses says, "Be still.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.500]   "Put your, dip yourself in.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.540]   "Create a resolve in you.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.040]   "Don't go backwards.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.880]   "Don't go back.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.820]   "I know it's scary, I know it's hard,
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.940]   "but don't be afraid.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.360]   "God's gonna fight this battle for us.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.720]   "You're gonna see God about to do something
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.000]   "that you never experienced.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.260]   "All you have to do right now is choose to not move.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.000]   "Choose to stay where you are,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.440]   "even though you feel trapped,
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.840]   "even though you feel fear,
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.700]   "even though you think nothing is gonna happen.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.280]   "Some of you just need to be still.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.660]   "Every time that you wanna retreat, be still.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.960]   "Every time you wanna give up, be still.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.900]   "Every time that you're allowing your slavery
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.320]   "to be more comfortable to you than your future,
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.660]   "which seems uncertain, be still.
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.660]   "Do not move backwards."
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.980]   Are you with me?
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.560]   You root yourself in, you say,
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.800]   "This is where I'm gonna be,
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.860]   "even though it's hard, even though it's difficult.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.940]   "The first choice I make is I stop my heart
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.880]   "from wanting to be tempted to go back that way.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.920]   "I will be still.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.080]   "I will be still."
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.440]   Some of you are on a trajectory right now
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.840]   that God doesn't have for you.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.360]   And he's just saying, "Just stop.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:16.020]   "Just take a moment to be still,
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.520]   "and you're gonna make much better
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.440]   "spiritual decisions in your life,
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.560]   "and practical ones, emotional ones,
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.460]   "financial ones, whatever they might be.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.920]   "You're gonna make much better decisions in your life
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.460]   "if you stop the panic of going backwards.
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.240]   "Just be still."
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.280]   Are you with me?
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.940]   Now, here's the funny thing,
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.440]   'cause then God shows up and contradicts
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.520]   everything Moses has just done.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.120]   I love this.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.360]   Who knows that God sometimes shows up
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.460]   and contradicts everything you've just done?
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.320]   Okay, just me, all right.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.660]   Then the Lord said to Moses,
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.140]   "Why are you crying out to me?
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.740]   "Tell the Israelites to move on.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.080]   "Reach out your staff and stretch out your hand
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.700]   "over the sea to divide the water
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.760]   "so that the Israelites can go through the sea
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.160]   "to the other side on dry ground."
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.080]   I love this.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.540]   So here's Moses going, "Be still."
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.200]   And then God shows up and goes, "Move on."
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.420]   And Israel's probably like, "What do I do?
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.600]   "Do I be still or move on?
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.440]   "Be still or move on?
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.600]   "What am I supposed to do?"
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.340]   And it feels like it's contradictory, but it's not.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.120]   Because it was absolutely right for Moses
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.480]   to arrest the backwards movement of the choice
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.740]   of the heart of his people by telling them to be still.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.420]   But then God shows up and says,
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.860]   "It's right for you to be still for a time,
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.260]   "but inertia is not your permanent destiny."
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:33.160]   Inertia is right for a time,
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.460]   but it is not where you are to make camp.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.700]   You are to move on.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.180]   You are to be moving forward.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.260]   You are to be moving into the future that I've got for you.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.260]   So yes, you had to stop.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.740]   Yes, you had to dig in.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.820]   Notice, by the way, the word for move on
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.200]   here in the Hebrew, it means to uproot your tent pegs.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.760]   It's almost like God is saying to Israel,
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.220]   "You gotta be ready.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.680]   "You had to dig in for a while,
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.320]   "but now I want you to uproot that
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.480]   "because I'm about to move.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.700]   "I'm about to do something and you gotta get ready to go.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.600]   "You gotta be the one who's moving forward.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.240]   "You gotta be the one who's believing
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.660]   "that you're gonna take faith over fear.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.580]   "You're gonna be the one who's gonna say no
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.000]   "to the consumption of your past
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.760]   "and say yes to creating your future.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.800]   "That's gotta be in your heart.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.700]   "So you need to undo those tent pegs
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.540]   "and you need to get yourself ready to move on,
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.800]   "to move forward."
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.700]   It's like God is saying,
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.740]   "Take the handbrake off your life
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.000]   "because there's a green light in front of you."
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.920]   Anyone here ever been in a car at a traffic light
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.120]   and the traffic light goes from red to green
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.880]   and the car in front of you doesn't move?
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.080]   Anyone been in that situation?
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   (humming)
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.340]   Here's the biggest truth I'll preach all day.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.560]   The amount of time that it takes you to honk your horn
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.000]   shows how Christian you are.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.700]   Preach it, preach it.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.820]   'Cause if you're Jesus, boy, you wait.
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.020]   Oh man, they must be texting somebody.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.380]   Must be a really important text.
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.360]   I'm just gonna wait, I'm gonna be patient,
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.620]   I'm gonna let them do their thing.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:36:59.740]   They'll move when they're ready.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.160]   Bless them, they must be having a really hard day.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.860]   Just Jesus, just, I get an opportunity to pray for them.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.820]   They're right in front of me right now.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:10.820]   Lord Jesus, I wanna bless that car, bless that family.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.580]   If you're anything like me, you're not like Jesus.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.120]   If you're anything like me, you're on that horn
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.520]   as quickly as you possibly can because it's green
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.160]   and the people are not going.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   God in this moment is not very Christian
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.560]   because it's green but the people are not moving.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:32.440]   And so he shows up and says, honk, courtesy honk.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.600]   I'll give you a real honk later,
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.100]   but courtesy honk right now.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.680]   It's time to move on, it's time to get going.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.840]   Don't dig yourself in anymore.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.800]   Uproot your tent pegs, get ready to move.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.320]   I love this because this is so important, church.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.720]   God is inviting Israel to move forward into their future
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   out of their choice of faith in him,
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.560]   not in a response to fear.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.880]   Church, this is so important.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.600]   Fear does not just drive you backwards.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.680]   Fear can also drive you forwards in life.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.560]   Fear can also be a very motivating factor
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.480]   for us to move forward in life.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.440]   Fear can even motivate you to do things of God.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.480]   But let me tell you, anytime you do something of God
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.760]   out of a place of fear, you are not going to be
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.560]   reaping the benefits that God has for you.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.080]   We can't serve God from a place of fear.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.540]   We have to serve God from a place of faith.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.200]   So it is not Pharaoh who is chasing them.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.180]   It is God who is inviting them.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.260]   God is saying, move forward in faith.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.800]   Don't move forward into that ocean
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.880]   because you're afraid of the people behind you.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.280]   Move forward into that ocean
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.760]   because you've made a decision,
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.280]   a choice in your heart today to follow me.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.360]   You have made a decision to say, you will provide,
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.320]   you will split the sea, you'll do something.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.680]   I don't know how you're gonna do it,
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.720]   but I'm gonna move forward in faith
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.040]   because I'm choosing faith over fear.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.160]   I'm gonna have the thing that moves me forward in life
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.840]   to be faith and not fear.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   Notice that God asks Israel to do this
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.480]   before he splits the sea.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.700]   Oh, it would have been easy to walk forward
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.760]   once the sea was split.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.400]   You can imagine, like, God does this amazing miracle, right?
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.120]   And they're being chased by these Egyptians,
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.240]   and then God says, move on.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.960]   They'll be like, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.940]   And like, off they would go, like, straight away, right?
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:13.780]   They would run away.
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.760]   They'd be like, yeah, I'm going, man, I'm going.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.560]   God's like, I haven't even done anything in the ocean yet,
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.300]   but you need to move on.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.640]   You need to put your feet,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.080]   get your feet wet before I do anything.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.000]   You need to make a decision in your heart.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.340]   Remember, this is all about God strengthening
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.640]   the heart muscles, the decision muscles,
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.640]   the choice muscles to take faith over fear.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.720]   He's like, go.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.280]   And yes, Moses is gonna stretch out his hand.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.600]   He's gonna stretch out that staff,
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.680]   and he's gonna touch that water,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.040]   and it's gonna do this crazy, amazing miracle,
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.280]   and they're gonna go through,
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.760]   and then the Egyptians are gonna chase,
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.280]   and the water's gonna collapse on them.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.480]   All of that is about to happen.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.800]   And God says to Moses, stretch out your hand
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.940]   and see what's about to happen.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.720]   There's a partnership that God's inviting his people into.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.240]   First of all, to have the decision in their hearts
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.600]   to move forward in faith,
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.580]   and then to back that decision with action.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:06.220]   Stretch out your staff and watch the obstacles part.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:11.220]   Do you wanna know today who Moses' staff is in this world?
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.560]   It's the church.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:19.360]   The church is God's staff that he stretches out
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.920]   before all of the obstacles
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.240]   that are stopping people from coming to faith.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.500]   And he's saying, watch the obstacles part.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:32.640]   You, the greatest expression of your spirituality
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.640]   will always be your choices.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.820]   And if you're gonna walk into the freedom
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.020]   that God has for you, that he's paid the price for,
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.920]   that he's already released you into,
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:48.620]   our decision to choose, to choose that uncertain future
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.800]   when we know what the past has been like,
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.540]   to take that step of faith and really believe
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.780]   that he's gonna come through, to see him.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.180]   And we're not making blind faith choices.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.460]   We have the scriptures.
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.140]   We have the spirit of God in us.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.180]   We have all the times that we come together and worship.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.480]   We have the testimony of God working in people's lives.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.300]   We have the testimony of God working in our lives.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.300]   It's not like we're walking forward blindly.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.440]   We know the character of God.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.500]   We see the character of God.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.740]   We understand the character of God.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.660]   He's spoken to us.
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.500]   He's filled us.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.700]   He's done the work of the cross.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.020]   It's not in our strength that we do this, it's in him.
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.340]   But we still choose, choose to move forward
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.560]   in all that God is or choose to remain inert
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.160]   or go backwards in the fear that we hold.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.100]   Some of you in this room, this is a wording season for you
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.980]   because you are currently moving backwards and you know it.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.720]   You're returning to the things that you know
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.080]   you don't want to be doing.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.120]   Be still today.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:42.240]   Dig yourself in, give yourself some time
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.240]   before you make a decision
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.000]   that might ruin you or your family.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.800]   Some of you in this room, you wanna move forward
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.080]   but you are tempted to move forward in fear.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.880]   God would say to you, move forward in faith.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.720]   Move forward in hope.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.160]   Take the chance of the uncertainty of your future
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.800]   'cause it is there that I will meet you.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.100]   I will split the sea.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.520]   That obstacle that's in front of you, I am gonna move it
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.820]   but you're gonna have to make the choice
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.420]   to partner with me and stretch out your staff
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.660]   and believe that the waters will part.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.780]   Greatest thing you'll ever do
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.220]   is make the spiritual choice to follow him.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.140]   Have faith, vine, not fear.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.820]   Amen?
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.740]   All right, could you stand with me?
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.780]   I wanna pray for you.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.780]   I don't wonder whether you just hold your hands open
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.420]   before you if you're comfortable to do so.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.300]   I believe that this is an important word for many of us.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.540]   And just at the start of the service,
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.700]   I invited us to think about our obstacles,
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.500]   the things that are in front of us now.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.180]   As you stand before him with your hands open,
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.620]   maybe you can bring to mind once again
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.060]   that red sea of yours.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.940]   And for those of you here
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.780]   where the temptation is to move backwards,
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.840]   maybe the fear is strong and I understand that.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.400]   Maybe the obstacle seems insurmountable.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.600]   You don't know if there's going to be a way.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.880]   And everything inside of you is telling you to go back,
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.120]   that you're at a dead end.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.400]   What the Israelites thought was a dead end
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.360]   was actually about to become a highway.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.040]   And what you're thinking is a dead end right now
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:22.880]   is a highway.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:28.040]   And notice that God did not take Israel around the Red Sea.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.920]   He took them through it.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.820]   And some of you, what you think is your dead end,
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.160]   what you would like God to just remove from you
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.800]   is actually the very thing that he'll walk you through.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.920]   Though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.760]   he is with me.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.520]   For some of you, the call is to be still,
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.000]   to take the courage today to say,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.920]   "I will stop moving backwards."
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.360]   Help me, Lord.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.480]   Help me, Lord.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.960]   Help me to trust you.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.420]   Help me to just be still.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.360]   Give me the courage to say no.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.720]   Give me the courage to stand against what my heart is
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.660]   trying to tell me to do,
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.300]   what the fear in me is trying to tell me to do.
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:10.220]   Lord, I root myself, dig myself into you.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.820]   When all else seems lost,
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.700]   when all else seems like it's gonna fail,
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.100]   I root and dig myself into you, Lord.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:19.980]   And then for some of us,
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.420]   there's a green light where you think it's red.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.560]   And God is giving you that courtesy honk.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.340]   And he's saying, "It's time to move."
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.520]   Pull up your tent pegs.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.560]   It was right for you to be just stable for a while,
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.280]   but now it's time to move.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.280]   Take a step of faith and move forward,
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.760]   not in fear, but in faith,
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.720]   knowing that I'm with you,
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.360]   that the wind of my spirit is with you.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   And together, we're gonna do amazing things.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.000]   There's Mount Sinai ahead of you.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.820]   There's my presence,
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.240]   like you've never experienced it before, ahead of you.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.680]   There's the promised land that you're gonna go and conquer
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.520]   that is ahead of you.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.300]   You could only see the victories that are ahead of you,
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.300]   but it's gonna come through the strengthening of your heart,
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.220]   the strengthening of your faith.
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.880]   Father, come Holy Spirit.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.460]   I pray and release faith over these people
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.780]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.160]   And I pray that faith would rise up in the house,
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.460]   that faith would be what we are moving forward in
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:22.860]   as a community of God.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.820]   Thank you, Lord, that you taught the Israelites
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.100]   a place of great faith.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.600]   Would you teach us and show us and release in us great faith
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.080]   and we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.640]   Everyone says.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.480]   Amen.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.080]   Let's worship together as we respond in great faith.
