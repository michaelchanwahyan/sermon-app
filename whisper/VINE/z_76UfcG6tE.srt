1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
 in Jesus' name, amen.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,960
 - Amen.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,960
 Thank you, Carla.

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,960
 Congratulations to all the baptism candidates.

5
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,440
 What a wonderful day to celebrate together.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,920
 And so yeah, as Carla said, over the past five weeks,

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,200
 we've been exploring, right, through the Old Testament,

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,720
 these encounters with God.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,520
 And through looking at the different characters

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,400
 and the encounters they have had,

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,600
 the hope is that you've been challenged,

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,560
 you've been inspired, and hopefully even changed

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,840
 as you start to apply some of these things

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,280
 that we've been talking about into your own life.

15
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,360
 The whole heart behind this series was that,

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,840
 you know, right at the beginning of the year,

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,800
 I'm not sure if you remember,

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,080
 the word spoken over us by the Lord was intimacy.

19
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,880
 And these encounters prove that God is a God

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,600
 that wants to be close to us,

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,960
 that wants us to be close to him,

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,360
 that wants to reveal things about himself to us

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,080
 so that we can get to know him.

24
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,600
 However, and this is the other side of the coin,

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,040
 being close to God, encountering him in all we do,

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,360
 knowing and feeling the love of Jesus

27
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,840
 is not necessarily the end goal

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,600
 of what it means to call yourself a Christian.

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,920
 And yes, over the summer, right,

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,040
 we've had some incredible moments in this room.

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,800
 Even this morning, today,

32
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,280
 there have been times where we've been worshiping

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,440
 when it feels like we're worshiping

34
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,240
 with the angels themselves in heaven, right?

35
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,920
 Just really passionate, intimate moments of worship.

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,200
 There have been stories and testimonies shared

37
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,560
 where we've been moved, it's been encouraging for our souls.

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,760
 You've heard sermons, hopefully,

39
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,440
 that you've said, yes, that's the word for me.

40
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,320
 That's so good, I really resonate with that.

41
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,680
 We've been growing with numbers, as you can see.

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,400
 We're busting at the seams with overflow sometimes.

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,320
 Community groups have been going.

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,320
 All this shows, yes, there has been sort of life

45
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,000
 in the church, and we thank God for this,

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,880
 and it's amazing, and it's a blessing,

47
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,000
 but it makes being part of this community so exciting.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,520
 You know, coming here on a Sunday is an amazing experience

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,120
 that we all get to enjoy together,

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,040
 but still, this is not the main goal,

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,320
 because if all we've done is created life

52
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,800
 inside this building, inside the church,

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,880
 I feel like we've been missing one of the key parts

54
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,400
 of what it means to be called a disciple,

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,280
 to be called a follower of Jesus,

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,360
 and in fact, if this is all that we've achieved,

57
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,880
 maybe we've been wasting our time even,

58
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,040
 and God might not be as pleased with us

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,480
 as we think that he is, and we risk missing out

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,560
 on one of the main points, one of the most glorious things

61
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,240
 about what it means to be a disciple,

62
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,120
 to be a follower of Jesus.

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,640
 So what is this point I'm talking about?

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,360
 Well, you may have noticed that each time

65
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,480
 our Bible characters as an encounter with God,

66
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,460
 right, there is a mission.

67
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,120
 There is a greater purpose that goes along with it.

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,080
 It's not just for that person's benefit.

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,480
 In fact, as you've been led through the series,

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,120
 most of the time, it's at great cost and inconvenience

71
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,600
 for that person, great sacrifice for that person

72
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,340
 who God encounters, but there's always a bigger impact

73
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,720
 to those around them, right?

74
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,560
 We didn't look at the prophet Jeremiah.

75
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,000
 I saved us from that, 'cause Jeremiah's a key example,

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,040
 right, of a prophet that encounters God,

77
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,160
 God speaks to him, and he hates it, actually.

78
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,720
 But he's like, "Stop speaking to me, Lord.

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,880
 "I can't take this," you know?

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,660
 But it feels like there's like a fire inside his bones,

81
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,120
 right, you know that Bible verse,

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,760
 that because God has spoken to him,

83
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,300
 he can't help but speak it back out.

84
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,420
 But it's not a comfortable position for him to be in.

85
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,400
 Right, with Jacob, we see, right, he wrestles with God,

86
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,160
 but the greater impact was to inspire

87
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,660
 the birth of a new nation.

88
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,160
 For Joshua, right, he encounters God,

89
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,300
 but the bigger part of that was to prove to the Canaanites

90
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,320
 that God is the only one true God.

91
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,160
 For Daniel, right, as he wrestles with King Darius,

92
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,720
 and he gets thrown into the lion's den,

93
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,640
 he encounters God in the lion's den.

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,040
 The bigger impact that comes from that

95
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,000
 is the decree that comes at the end

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,340
 where the whole kingdom, king degrees,

97
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,480
 has to now worship God.

98
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,380
 For Elijah, it was a reminder, right,

99
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,720
 to turn the Israelites back to God,

100
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,720
 away from idol worship.

101
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 For Hannah, it was the call for her to, you know,

102
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,700
 she did eventually give birth to a child,

103
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,560
 but then she turns around and sacrifices

104
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,800
 and gives that child back to the Lord.

105
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,000
 And so it's the same for us today, right?

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
 We don't want to encounter God

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
 so that the church on Sundays can be this amazing gathering

108
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,080
 that we get to enjoy this week, each week.

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,000
 Yes, it's a privilege we get to do this,

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,640
 but what we really should be asking for

111
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,400
 is for God to encounter us so that he can use this body

112
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,840
 to work through his church, to disrupt our lives,

113
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,620
 to enter out our wills and purposes

114
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,980
 so that he can be made known to others.

115
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,520
 That is what we're trying to do here this morning.

116
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,280
 God's heart is that we would encounter him

117
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,580
 so that we can make him known to everyone else.

118
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,640
 Psalm 46 makes this point well.

119
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,540
 Okay, Bible quiz for one second, okay?

120
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,640
 Finish this verse.

121
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,120
 Be still and know that I am God.

122
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,160
 What comes next?

123
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,740
 But you know that's not the end of this verse, right?

124
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,480
 But we sing this song, right, the song "Still,"

125
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,020
 and we feel God close to us,

126
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,440
 but the proper end, this is not the end of this verse.

127
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,380
 So it sort of misses the point.

128
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,200
 And now don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing on "Still,"

129
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,080
 okay, it's one of my favorite songs.

130
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
 I love that song.

131
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,400
 It's carried me through some deep seasons

132
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,080
 of trouble in my life.

133
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,140
 But the entirety of that verse reads like this.

134
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,860
 Be still and know that I am God.

135
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,340
 I will be exalted among the nations.

136
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,880
 I will be exalted in the earth.

137
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,620
 In other words, church is not about us.

138
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,420
 What God's really saying here is be still

139
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,920
 and let me know that I'm close to you.

140
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,560
 That's not what he's saying.

141
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,900
 But what he's saying is be still so that you can see

142
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,700
 I am God that is exalted over everything in this world.

143
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,020
 And that hits a little bit different

144
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,980
 when we look at it from that perspective

145
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,540
 in its entire context.

146
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,080
 Because it's not just about knowing God,

147
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,200
 it's about making him known.

148
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,700
 And all this talk about encountering God,

149
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,340
 yes, it should give you a deeper appreciation of God,

150
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,480
 a more intimate relationship with him.

151
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,100
 Yes, it should have strengthened your faith,

152
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,260
 but at the same time, it should have also given you

153
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,700
 a deeper love for others

154
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,020
 because this is God's heart for the world.

155
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,680
 It should have also led you to a desire

156
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,260
 to let other people know about him.

157
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,220
 It should have motivated you to think like,

158
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,840
 oh my goodness, God is so good, God is so amazing.

159
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,940
 This encounter I've had has been so powerful.

160
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,820
 I cannot possibly keep it to myself anymore.

161
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,660
 I have to tell someone about this.

162
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,940
 All people everywhere, all the time,

163
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,960
 need to know who God is.

164
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,700
 And I'm not gonna give myself rest

165
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,740
 until everyone knows out there

166
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,820
 that there is a God exalted over everything in this world.

167
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,660
 Amen?

168
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,800
 This is what our purpose is.

169
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,260
 This is what the church is for.

170
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,640
 In fact, this is so important to God's heart.

171
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,940
 Jesus' last words before he went into heaven

172
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,540
 was a command to make this happen.

173
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,060
 Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth

174
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,420
 "has been given to me.

175
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,000
 "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,960
 "baptizing them in the name of the Father

177
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,620
 "and of the Son of the Holy Spirit,

178
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,520
 "and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you,

179
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,080
 "and surely I'm with you always

180
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,520
 "to the very end of the age."

181
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,140
 The Great Commission, Matthew 28.

182
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,420
 In another version of this, he says it like this.

183
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,740
 "But you will receive power

184
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,260
 "when the Holy Spirit comes on you,

185
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,320
 "and you will be my witnesses, my declarers,

186
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,860
 "in Jerusalem, in Judea, and Samaria,

187
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,580
 "and to the ends of the earth."

188
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,420
 Acts 1:8.

189
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,860
 Right, notice what Jesus didn't say.

190
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,900
 He didn't say the last thing he said.

191
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,420
 You know, "Hey, don't forget to come to church every Sunday."

192
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,060
 Right, that's not what he said.

193
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,020
 He didn't say, "Hey, don't forget

194
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,480
 "to join up to the community groups."

195
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,720
 He didn't say, "Don't forget to give

196
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,600
 "your tithes and your offerings."

197
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,120
 His last and final instructions were to go.

198
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,180
 "Go and tell people about me.

199
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,780
 "Go and tell people who God is.

200
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,580
 "Go and be a witness to people

201
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,480
 "about your encounters with me.

202
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,600
 "Make disciples, baptize them,

203
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,160
 "teach them what I've taught you."

204
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,520
 These are verbs, these are action words

205
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,740
 called for us to go and do.

206
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,920
 So the question today is,

207
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,480
 are we doing the work of making disciples?

208
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,300
 Are we proclaiming to Jesus,

209
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,860
 is to those who don't know him yet.

210
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,340
 Are we taking action to make Jesus known to everyone?

211
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,740
 And how do we do this, church?

212
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,480
 We do this by preaching the word.

213
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,300
 If we want God to be lifted high in this world,

214
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,860
 if we want Jesus to be exalted as a name above all names,

215
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,120
 we as his children, as his body, have to preach the word.

216
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,300
 And this is the challenge from scripture

217
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,780
 for all of us today.

218
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,880
 Now, I'm not gonna try and sugarcoat anything

219
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,420
 because it is a massive challenge.

220
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,220
 But I believe it's one that we are all,

221
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,900
 every single person in this room,

222
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,820
 is called to respond to.

223
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,560
 It's a challenge that if we can commit

224
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,260
 to doing our very best to meet it,

225
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,260
 this will be the kind of community,

226
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,460
 the kind of society, the kind of church

227
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,820
 that Jesus is looking for.

228
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,100
 That's my introduction, okay?

229
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,500
 So let's look at today's passage.

230
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,780
 I'm reading from 2 Timothy 4, 1 to 5.

231
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,620
 It says this.

232
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,700
 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus

233
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,380
 who will judge the living and the dead,

234
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,560
 and in view of his appearing and his kingdom,

235
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,940
 I give you this charge.

236
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,760
 I give you this charge.

237
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
 Preach the word.

238
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,700
 Be prepared in season and out of season.

239
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,740
 Correct, rebuke, encourage with great patience

240
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,180
 and careful instruction.

241
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,440
 For the time will come when people

242
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
 will not put up with sound doctrine.

243
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,060
 Instead, to suit their own desires,

244
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,140
 they will gather around with them

245
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,800
 a great number of teachers to say

246
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,540
 what their itching ears want to hear.

247
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,500
 They will turn their ears away from the truth

248
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,900
 and turn aside to myths.

249
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,100
 But you, keep your head in all situations.

250
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,780
 Endure hardship.

251
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,760
 Do the work of an evangelist.

252
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,440
 Discharge all the duties of your ministry.

253
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,300
 Okay, this is good, I think.

254
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,420
 No one's running out the door so far, okay?

255
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,600
 So I'm gonna take it as, if you're sitting here

256
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,560
 continuing to listen, I'm gonna take it as

257
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,220
 thinking that you mean everyone's buying in.

258
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,280
 You're saying, yes, we want to learn

259
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,500
 what it means to do this.

260
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,420
 Together, we want to preach God's word.

261
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,180
 So we'll get to that in a minute.

262
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,040
 But before Paul gets to the how, how do we do this,

263
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,140
 first he gives us a sense of why.

264
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,980
 And the why is actually quite,

265
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,620
 it's a good reminder for us.

266
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,960
 The why is because time is running out.

267
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,820
 Paul starts his charge with a sense of urgency.

268
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,220
 He's telling us, this isn't something

269
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,480
 we can save for later.

270
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,820
 This isn't something that you put on the back burner.

271
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,300
 It's not a slow cooker moment.

272
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,860
 We'll wait and check on it later to see what happens.

273
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,720
 Preaching the word is a challenge

274
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,740
 that needs to be responded to today, right now.

275
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,260
 Time is of the essence.

276
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,100
 He says it like this, in the presence of God

277
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,580
 and Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead

278
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,940
 and in view of his appearing and his kingdom,

279
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,380
 I give you this charge.

280
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,840
 As Paul was writing this letter,

281
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,340
 he's writing to a young protégé,

282
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,940
 a young follower, disciple of his, called Timothy.

283
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,340
 And during the time of Paul's writing,

284
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,820
 he's in deep trouble, actually.

285
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,260
 He's imprisoned because of his dedication

286
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,180
 to preaching the gospel.

287
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,500
 And this time, he seems to be aware

288
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,260
 that his time on earth is limited.

289
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,940
 He feels like he could be executed any moment now.

290
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,480
 He's had a few run-ins with the law.

291
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,200
 He's been in prison a bunch of times.

292
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,660
 But this time, he just senses,

293
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,880
 he just knows something is different.

294
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,140
 I don't have much time left, so I have to tell you this.

295
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,780
 But this is also a reminder for us.

296
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,660
 Now, I'm not sure how often you think

297
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,820
 about the brevity of life.

298
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,380
 I know it's a bit of a morbid thing to think about,

299
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,740
 but probably day to day,

300
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,020
 hopefully it's not something we focus on too much, right?

301
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,220
 It kind of gets us down.

302
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,080
 But as each day goes past, right,

303
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,700
 the sun goes up, the sun goes down.

304
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
 We live our lives.

305
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,820
 We wake up, brush your teeth, hopefully,

306
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,900
 have breakfast, get ready to work,

307
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,660
 drop the kids off at school, right,

308
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,740
 argue with your partner over what to have for dinner, right,

309
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,420
 send memes to your bestie on Instagram,

310
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,660
 go shopping, do exercise, you know,

311
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,180
 decide what to watch on Netflix,

312
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,020
 and then fall asleep in front of the TV, right?

313
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,500
 All the day to day routine of things.

314
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,420
 Occasionally, we might look to the future and say,

315
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,440
 okay, I'm gonna go on holiday here or there sometime.

316
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,300
 But here's the reality, church.

317
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,120
 The reality is tomorrow is not guaranteed for any of us.

318
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,140
 Everyone's time on this earth could end at any moment.

319
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,300
 And when that happens, we find ourselves,

320
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,720
 we're going to find ourselves face to face with Jesus.

321
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,420
 Life on earth will end in two ways.

322
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,860
 Either your body will stop working

323
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,380
 and there's a whole bunch of stuff

324
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,300
 that can cause that to happen,

325
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,620
 or Jesus comes back and nobody apart from the Father

326
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,420
 knows when exactly that's gonna be.

327
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,320
 The truth is, we don't know.

328
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,560
 We'll never know how close we are to the final day

329
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,920
 until it actually hits us.

330
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,400
 Which is why the Bible tells us to be careful how we live.

331
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,620
 Which is why it tells us to live each day as people,

332
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,820
 ready to meet Jesus face to face.

333
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,680
 Because when we do meet him face to face,

334
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,880
 we have to be ready,

335
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,640
 because that means it's time for judgment.

336
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,420
 Right, we're gonna meet Jesus face to face,

337
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,880
 either he's gonna come back to fully reclaim this earth,

338
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,580
 and when we do see him, there's gonna be some questions

339
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,080
 he's gonna ask us.

340
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,360
 He's coming back, it says, to judge the living and the dead.

341
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,080
 So what's he gonna judge us on?

342
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,740
 Well, he's gonna ask us questions, I think,

343
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,180
 things like this.

344
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,400
 Have you been a good and faithful servant?

345
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,540
 Have you loved me with all your heart,

346
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,280
 mind, soul, and strength?

347
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,560
 Have you loved others as I have loved you?

348
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,080
 Have you looked after the widows and the orphans?

349
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,040
 Have you been a voice of justice to the weak

350
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,080
 and the oppressed?

351
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,840
 All of which can be summed up in this question, I think.

352
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,900
 Have you preached the word of God?

353
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,880
 Church, are we living in the light of Jesus' return?

354
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,800
 Do we live life knowing that it could

355
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,400
 truly be over at any moment?

356
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,440
 And because of this, do we realize that there's

357
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,880
 a severe urgency in the way we live?

358
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,040
 Because of this, we have to preach the word.

359
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,200
 Preach the word.

360
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,960
 Be prepared in and out of season to correct,

361
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,360
 rebuke, encourage with great patience

362
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,280
 and careful instruction.

363
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,760
 Preach the word, church.

364
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,160
 Okay, I know, this is the preacher on a Sunday

365
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,720
 telling people to preach the word, right?

366
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,760
 Isn't this your job?

367
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,160
 We pay you to do this, right?

368
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,640
 This is what you're employed for, Alison.

369
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,480
 And yes, right, part of what we do on a Sunday

370
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,640
 is to preach the word.

371
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,120
 And for me on a personal level,

372
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,480
 I feel like this is something that God's called me to do,

373
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,680
 I enjoy doing, right?

374
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,260
 This is a part of my ministry.

375
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,000
 However, the word preach does not mean

376
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,400
 the preaching, the teaching, unpacking of God's word

377
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,160
 at 11, 15, 12, and nine of 15 on a Sunday, right?

378
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,720
 That's not what it means.

379
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,880
 Preach simply means to proclaim or to talk about.

380
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,640
 And when Paul says the word,

381
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,800
 it's not referring to just the actual words

382
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,720
 of scripture itself.

383
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,200
 But the word is really referring

384
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,400
 to the overall Christian message, right?

385
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,880
 The message of truth and love and hope.

386
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,480
 The message that King Jesus is the one

387
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,520
 who is the one true king, king of all kings.

388
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,760
 He loved you enough to go to the cross for you

389
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,400
 as a sacrifice.

390
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,000
 That is life, death, and resurrection

391
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,120
 means grace, mercy, and forgiveness

392
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,040
 to all who will put their trust in him.

393
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,800
 But here's the other thing as well,

394
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,280
 preaching is not just with words.

395
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,080
 Part of preaching also has to be

396
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,680
 how we live our lives, right?

397
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,920
 Do we live a life that is in tune with Jesus?

398
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,760
 Like I was saying just now,

399
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,240
 do we love others like he does?

400
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,680
 Do we serve the poor and the marginalized?

401
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,240
 Are we living in the truth?

402
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,200
 Do we resist temptation and evil?

403
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,520
 We preach the word also when we live a life

404
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,160
 that reflects the life of Jesus.

405
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,040
 So preaching the word means talking about

406
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,640
 and demonstrating the message of Jesus.

407
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,840
 Now this is something everyone can do.

408
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,280
 Not just the man behind, not just the person,

409
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,160
 the man or woman behind the pulpit,

410
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,600
 but every single person.

411
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,040
 And this challenge is one that we have to live by

412
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,920
 all of the time.

413
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,200
 In Paul's word he says, "In season and out of season."

414
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,120
 Now if you look through my Instagram algorithm,

415
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
 there's a lot of random stuff,

416
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,080
 a lot of parenting tips, pranks you play on people,

417
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,880
 easy recipes, but also motivational things, right?

418
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,800
 There's a motivational guy, I'm not gonna call his name,

419
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,040
 he uses a lot of very colorful language.

420
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,920
 Sometimes I listen to him to get myself

421
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,640
 to get ready to work out or something like that.

422
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,480
 But if motivational quotes are your thing,

423
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,240
 you've probably heard some of these, right?

424
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,880
 Failure to prepare is what?

425
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,520
 Preparation to fail.

426
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,040
 Ooh, yeah.

427
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,720
 Stay ready so you don't have to get ready.

428
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,040
 All those kind of things.

429
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,760
 Now this is something that I've noticed.

430
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,400
 We like to apply this mindset

431
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,000
 to certain aspects of our life.

432
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,840
 Stay on the grind.

433
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
 When it comes to things like working out

434
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,160
 or chasing your personal goal, reaching your dreams,

435
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,600
 come on, yeah, no days off, let's get it,

436
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
 let's go, let's go, let's go, right?

437
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
 These are the kind of things

438
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,480
 that we like to motivate ourselves with.

439
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,760
 But for some reason, when it comes to preaching

440
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,360
 and living out the word, woof,

441
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,520
 suddenly we don't feel like we're ready.

442
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,480
 Suddenly we're full of excuses.

443
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,600
 Things like, oh, you know,

444
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,560
 I don't really know the Bible well enough yet

445
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,520
 to go and talk to that person about it.

446
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,400
 It's gonna be really awkward if I ask that person

447
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,280
 and if I can pray for them, right?

448
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,080
 Now this person's gonna think I'm a weirdo

449
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
 if I ask them if they want to know who Jesus is.

450
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,000
 Oh, no, I don't have much time right now.

451
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,320
 I'm busy.

452
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,520
 I'll serve the community next year.

453
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,280
 It's not just a good time for me right now.

454
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,840
 I'm gonna wait for a better occasion before I,

455
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,280
 you can fill in the blank.

456
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,640
 But God's word here gives us no room for excuses.

457
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,680
 And the truth is this.

458
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,080
 If we're always waiting for the right time,

459
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,000
 we'll always find a right reason to put it off.

460
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,400
 This is what procrastination is.

461
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
 Like, trust me, okay?

462
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,520
 Like my wife always says, don't you know,

463
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,800
 I always say to my wife, excuse me,

464
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,560
 don't remind me every six months, okay?

465
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,160
 I'm gonna get round to fixing that cupboard

466
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,600
 in the wardrobe, okay?

467
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,000
 Procrastination is, I wrestle with it.

468
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,840
 But here's the point.

469
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,840
 If we only preach the gospel in times

470
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,080
 and conditions were right, it would never get done.

471
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,360
 And the challenge here is this.

472
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,560
 Whether the time seems right or not,

473
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,200
 that's not what matters.

474
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,640
 What matters is your readiness

475
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,080
 and your willingness to preach the word.

476
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,520
 Paul is saying here, preaching the word

477
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,720
 isn't something that we clock in and out of,

478
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,440
 something that we can just complimentalize

479
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,720
 as part of our lives.

480
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,640
 But this is something,

481
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,000
 if we want to stay on the grind for something,

482
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,720
 do it for the sake of preaching the gospel.

483
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,400
 Now, I'll caveat with this.

484
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,880
 At the same time, this doesn't constantly mean

485
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,080
 going around bashing people in the head with a Bible.

486
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,360
 That's not what it's calling us to do either.

487
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,320
 Don't get weird about it.

488
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,040
 Maybe you know people like this too.

489
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,720
 You can't even have a normal conversation.

490
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,160
 Someone like this, say, you ask them for a cup of water

491
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,320
 because you're thirsty.

492
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
 And instead of just handing you a cup of water,

493
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,320
 they'll say something like,

494
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,280
 oh, I know you're thirsty, brother.

495
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,520
 But do you know something else?

496
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,480
 You should be thirsty for the Lord,

497
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,160
 and you need the Holy Spirit in your life, right?

498
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,320
 Don't be that guy either, okay?

499
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,960
 That's not what it's calling us to do.

500
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,520
 The key here, okay, is to be prepared.

501
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,080
 Be prepared so that when that moment comes,

502
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,240
 whenever that is, whether it's convenient or not,

503
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,200
 you are ready to preach the word.

504
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,400
 And we preach this word.

505
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,760
 We believe in this word.

506
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,640
 We live by this word because the word has power.

507
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,640
 In other places, Paul would say that the word

508
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,840
 is like a double-edged sword, dividing soul and spirit.

509
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,560
 Early in the book of 2 Timothy,

510
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,760
 the word is described as useful for teaching,

511
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,120
 rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.

512
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,760
 In Romans, it tells us that faith comes from hearing

513
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,280
 the word and the word is heard through,

514
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,640
 and the message is heard through the word about Christ.

515
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,520
 Isaiah tells us that the only thing

516
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,120
 that's gonna last forever in this world is the word of God.

517
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,520
 And Paul here says the word has the power.

518
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,240
 It's got power to change people's lives.

519
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,760
 It's got the power to correct, rebuke, and encourage.

520
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,720
 Again, let's pause here to take a look at these words

521
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,280
 because they sound kind of serious,

522
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,440
 kind of scary, kind of judgmental.

523
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,000
 But I think what Paul's trying to do here

524
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,960
 is explain how the power of God's word

525
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,720
 has an immediate effect on our lives.

526
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,000
 So the first word he says is to correct.

527
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,640
 Correct means that the word is able to guide us back

528
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,720
 onto the right path.

529
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,780
 Scripture says the word of the Lord is a lamp to my feet

530
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,080
 and a guide unto my path.

531
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,080
 Now, this might make us a bit nervous

532
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,480
 because we live in a time and age

533
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,120
 where things don't really seem to have a right and a wrong.

534
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,160
 And when this is the case,

535
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,000
 then there isn't really anything to correct.

536
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,520
 What's true for you might not be true for me,

537
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,440
 but that's okay, right?

538
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,140
 We'll just agree to disagree.

539
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,340
 But the fact that God's word can be used to correct

540
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,900
 means that there is a right way.

541
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,480
 There is an objective truth

542
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,760
 that we can point people back towards.

543
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,120
 There is a standard which God expects his people to live by

544
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,040
 and God's word is how we know what that is.

545
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,480
 It's through God's word that we know

546
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,760
 how he wants us to live.

547
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,400
 It's through God's word that we can always point

548
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,460
 our lives back when it seems to go off course.

549
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,720
 His word becomes like the north star in our life

550
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,260
 by which we navigate our life by.

551
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,720
 So it's useful for correcting.

552
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,560
 Now, rebuking is the next word.

553
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,440
 This word might make us even more nervous

554
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,920
 because it's not just about now

555
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,120
 pointing out something that is wrong.

556
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,840
 It sounds like it's giving some kind of punishment.

557
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,800
 But again, the world might say, "How dare you?

558
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
 "Who do you think you are

559
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,960
 "to have the right to rebuke people?"

560
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,200
 But again, let me give you another way to look at it.

561
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,900
 If we're the ones who know the word, right,

562
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,180
 and we believe the word is the truth,

563
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,240
 if we're the ones that know the word is the truth

564
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,580
 and it's the correct way to live,

565
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,920
 and we see people around us going down a path

566
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,920
 that is away from the word, going in the wrong direction,

567
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,840
 in a direction that's going to lead to pain

568
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,700
 and destruction and death instead of life

569
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,600
 and life in the full,

570
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,200
 then you tell me what's the more loving thing to do,

571
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,340
 to continue to let that person or those people

572
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,860
 go down that path, or do everything you can

573
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,920
 to pull them back towards the truth,

574
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,240
 to rebuke and to correct, to lead them back

575
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,560
 on the path that leads to Jesus.

576
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,780
 Okay, but here's the key.

577
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,440
 And this is very important as well,

578
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,920
 because often this is the part I think we get wrong.

579
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,940
 Because when our methods of correcting and rebuking

580
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,440
 are not done in the right way,

581
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,660
 it can actually be really damaging

582
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,020
 and leads to hurting people.

583
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,800
 It leads to Christians being labeled

584
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,380
 and sometimes justifiably as being mean

585
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,160
 and arrogant, judgmental, hypocritical.

586
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,820
 So when we talk about correcting and rebuking,

587
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,040
 it has to be done in the right way.

588
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,220
 Which is why Paul adds at the end of this,

589
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,500
 the right way to do this is through encouragement.

590
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,720
 To encourage means to urge, to come alongside,

591
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,860
 to support, not to bash over the head.

592
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,540
 Okay, that's not encouraging.

593
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,060
 And with encouragement, it's also done

594
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,620
 with great patience and careful instruction.

595
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,580
 You see, we just correct and rebuke

596
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,780
 without patience and grace,

597
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,340
 that does not reflect the heart of God.

598
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,180
 And we come off as jerks and bad and hypocritical.

599
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,100
 Actually, when we do this,

600
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,540
 we don't just dishonor the name of yourself,

601
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,180
 but it also dishonors the name of Jesus.

602
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,940
 It makes him seem like a bad guy who's not caring,

603
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,580
 who's not patient, who's not full of grace and mercy.

604
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,120
 We have to understand that it's a journey

605
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,060
 to learn how to live according to the word,

606
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,000
 just like it's been a journey for you.

607
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,160
 And we can't expect people to get it right straight away.

608
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,360
 And when we rebuke without careful instruction,

609
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,680
 it leaves people feeling confused and frustrated.

610
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,400
 It's like telling somebody that they're wrong,

611
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,120
 but never explaining why.

612
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,720
 And when we correct without patience,

613
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,040
 it leaves people feeling frustrated and uncared for,

614
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,400
 like there's some sort of project

615
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,600
 that we've been sent to fix,

616
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,160
 just to take that off our list.

617
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,800
 So it has to be done with love, with grace,

618
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,340
 with mercy, with great patience and encouragement.

619
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,560
 And then Paul wants us to understand this,

620
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,880
 scripture wants us to understand this,

621
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,960
 it's not going to be easy.

622
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,040
 Preaching and living out the word

623
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,800
 is going to come with a whole lot of pushback,

624
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,380
 resistance, and even rebellion.

625
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,260
 He says it like this,

626
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,620
 "For the time will come

627
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,280
 "when people will not put up with sound doctrine.

628
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,060
 "Instead, to suit their own desires,

629
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,360
 "they will gather around them a great number of teachers

630
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,220
 "to say what the itching ears want to hear.

631
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,120
 "They will turn away from the truth

632
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,980
 "and turn aside to myths."

633
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,300
 Right, in other words,

634
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,900
 there is a time coming when people

635
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,420
 will not like the word that we're going to bring.

636
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,740
 Right, they're not going to like the word

637
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,180
 that is going to keep them close to God.

638
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,300
 They're not going to like the word

639
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,180
 that will help them be more like Jesus.

640
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,340
 They're not going to like teaching

641
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,300
 that's going to keep them strong in the Lord.

642
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,660
 They're not going to like it

643
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,020
 when they're corrected and rebuked

644
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,860
 because in their minds, they've already made up

645
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,880
 the decision of what is right and what is wrong.

646
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,740
 So instead of listening to the truth,

647
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,140
 instead of listening to what is good,

648
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,900
 they will simply find people to tell them

649
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,440
 whatever it is they want to hear,

650
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,420
 to tickle their ears,

651
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,580
 to make them feel better about themselves,

652
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,140
 thinking they can just rest easy,

653
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,740
 ignoring the fact that like we said at the beginning,

654
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,020
 Jesus is coming back to judge.

655
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,680
 And one day, we're going to have to give an account

656
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,520
 of how we've lived to him.

657
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,180
 This isn't a prophetic warning over the church.

658
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,420
 Now let's look at it this way, okay?

659
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,580
 Suppose you go for a checkup with your doctor

660
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,740
 and the doctor tells you,

661
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,420
 "You know what?

662
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,260
 "Cholesterol's looking kind of high.

663
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
 "Sugar level's kind of high.

664
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,780
 "Your heart's struggling a bit.

665
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,680
 "Maybe lay off the sugary foods.

666
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,440
 "Do more exercise, drink more water, sleep earlier.

667
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,820
 "Make a few changes because you're not healthy."

668
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,460
 Right, oh, okay, not my recent checkup I hope, okay?

669
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,860
 But imagine you went to the doctor and they told you that.

670
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,380
 Oh, but you don't want to do that, right?

671
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,760
 You want doughnuts for life.

672
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,660
 You say, "I'm not here for a long time.

673
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,340
 "I'm here for a good time, right?

674
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,720
 "I don't want to be skinny and healthy.

675
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,740
 "I want to be fat and happy."

676
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,940
 Right, and so you keep finding doctors.

677
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,020
 You keep finding doctors until you one find that says,

678
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,180
 "Oh, yeah, you know, whatever.

679
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,220
 "Yeah, it's high, but it's not like really high."

680
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,260
 And actually, you know what?

681
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,940
 Doughnuts actually have a lot of nutrients in them, right?

682
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,340
 So like doughnuts aren't the worst, okay?

683
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,140
 So in fact, you know what?

684
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,020
 I've read a recent report that sweat's not good for you.

685
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,500
 It clogs up your pores, right?

686
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,340
 And so, and you know, too much water isn't bad.

687
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,100
 You need some electrolytes in your life as well.

688
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,160
 So you know, like fizzy drinks, that's also fine, right?

689
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,380
 This is the kind of thinking

690
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,620
 that the church is in danger of, right?

691
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,460
 The trend that people just wanting to hear

692
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,540
 whatever they want to hear.

693
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,980
 The trend of people being told, "You're fine.

694
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,820
 "Don't change.

695
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,420
 "You don't need to discipline yourself.

696
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,580
 "You don't need to believe everything that Jesus says.

697
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,040
 "You do you, and it's all good."

698
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,780
 Listen, if you want to have your ears tickled,

699
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,040
 there are gonna be people out there

700
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,680
 who will tickle your ears in all sorts of ways.

701
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,340
 People like, I'm not gonna go there, okay?

702
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,580
 But there will be people, okay, that will lie to you, okay?

703
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,280
 And say things like, "Jesus promised you prosperity.

704
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,700
 "You just gotta name it and claim it,

705
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,140
 "and then it's yours," right?

706
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,140
 That's what Jesus says, right?

707
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,500
 They will take a verse like Psalm 37, four.

708
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,380
 Look, it says right here in the Bible,

709
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,780
 "God will give you the desires of your heart."

710
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,120
 So you're just gonna pray to God,

711
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,680
 and he's gonna give you everything you want, right?

712
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,740
 They will twist and turn and corrupt the Word of God

713
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,760
 so that people can feel as though they're following him

714
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,900
 without any cost, without any discipline,

715
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,820
 without any sacrifice in their lives.

716
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,260
 All this to say, if we're gonna commit

717
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:38,260
 to preaching the Word, make sure we're preaching the Word,

718
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,580
 not some watered-down, weakened,

719
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,460
 fluffy, ear-tickling version of it.

720
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,700
 And we have to watch out for this

721
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,780
 because this version is not the gospel.

722
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,980
 It might be what people want to hear,

723
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,100
 but it's not gonna be what they need.

724
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,520
 This version of the Word will strip it from its power.

725
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,740
 This version of the Word will carry no ability

726
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,620
 to set people free, to bring real hope, real life,

727
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,980
 real salvation to a world out there

728
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,160
 that's lost and suffering.

729
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:14,300
 Woe to me if I don't preach the gospel.

730
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,460
 If we are truly committed to preaching the Word,

731
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,280
 this church, brothers and sisters,

732
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,540
 is what we're gonna have to put up with.

733
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,920
 Which is why Paul points us with this final encouragement.

734
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,740
 But you, keep your head.

735
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,080
 In all situations, endure hardship,

736
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
 do the work of an evangelist,

737
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,080
 discharge all the duties of your ministry.

738
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,520
 In other words, Paul is saying,

739
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,980
 if you're finding this difficult to do,

740
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,420
 if it's a challenge, if it's hard,

741
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,640
 if you're coming against pushback,

742
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,800
 then you're probably doing the right thing.

743
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,360
 We are called to be different.

744
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,520
 We have been called to stand firm.

745
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,720
 We have been called not to turn to this and that,

746
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,040
 but rather, as it says here,

747
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,380
 keep your head in all situations.

748
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,520
 Don't be enticed by these false teachings,

749
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,040
 but focus on what you know is true.

750
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,720
 Endure hardship.

751
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,240
 As we do this, we know it's not going to be easy.

752
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,860
 Like we saw with the people we studied,

753
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,700
 it's gonna be difficult and painful at times,

754
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,920
 but let me ask you this, church,

755
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,560
 did you start following Jesus in order to have an easy life?

756
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,300
 I hope not.

757
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,960
 I hope your decision to follow Jesus

758
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,600
 was because you came to realize that he is the true king.

759
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,680
 You came to follow Jesus because you realized

760
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,880
 he is the only way, the truth, and the life.

761
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,720
 So we go on announcing Jesus is Lord.

762
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,760
 And no matter what happens, what's required is not success

763
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,320
 as the world sees success,

764
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,600
 but rather loyalty and perseverance to preaching his word.

765
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,540
 This is why the task, therefore, is to preach the word,

766
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,360
 do the work of the evangelist,

767
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,120
 an evangelist, the one that preaches and lives out

768
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,700
 and speaks the word of God.

769
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,960
 Never stop proclaiming the gospel in everything that you do.

770
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,840
 There is work to be done.

771
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,320
 And like I said, time is short.

772
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,440
 And now that we've encountered God, we know him,

773
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,560
 we come together each and every Sunday and we encounter him,

774
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,440
 now it's on us to preach the word.

775
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,600
 You may have classmates or schoolmates

776
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,000
 who have not yet heard the gospel.

777
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,460
 There may be family out there

778
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,820
 who are still to discover who Jesus is.

779
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,580
 You have colleagues who are lost and wondering,

780
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,380
 "Where is the purpose and direction of my life?"

781
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,100
 There's an opportunity there to point them towards Jesus.

782
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,060
 We have a city, 90-something percent of our city in Hong Kong

783
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,280
 still don't really know who Jesus is.

784
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,100
 And look around us, church.

785
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,960
 Each week we have more than 1,000 people,

786
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,860
 that's a lot of people, coming into this building.

787
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,060
 We worship, we connect, we encourage, we love, we care,

788
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,440
 we give, we do all these things within the building

789
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,840
 in the name of Jesus.

790
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,160
 And I love this church, I love the community,

791
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,040
 I love being part of the team here,

792
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,840
 but I'm fully convinced also

793
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,640
 that this is not all it's meant to be.

794
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,120
 And at the end of every Sunday, I always think to myself,

795
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,520
 "What if, what if every single person here

796
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,740
 "committed to preaching the word outside of this space?

797
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,400
 "What if every single person here

798
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,820
 "committed to help people around them

799
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:50,040
 "to come to a faith in Jesus through encouragement,

800
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,040
 "through love, through patience, no matter how hard it gets?"

801
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,560
 This is the key, this is how the world is changed.

802
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,320
 Look, it started from 12 disciples following Jesus

803
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,360
 to the billions of Christians

804
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,760
 that we see worshiping Jesus today.

805
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,200
 And that mission, that call continues for us

806
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,360
 to go and continue to preach the word.

807
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,940
 This is how we truly fulfill our purpose

808
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,000
 of lifting up the name of Jesus.

809
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,980
 So church, I challenge us, I challenge you and myself,

810
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,320
 preach the word in and out of season.

811
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,780
 Carry out your giftings, use them for the glory of God,

812
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,160
 to show the people around you who God truly is.

813
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,940
 This is what we've been called to do as a body of Christ.

814
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,940
 If you would close your eyes for a minute,

815
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,960
 I'm gonna pray for us.

816
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,260
 I'm gonna give us some guidance around what now to do next.

817
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,680
 (soft music)

818
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:09,120
 As we've been listening and thinking,

819
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,060
 and maybe the Holy Spirit's already been speaking to you

820
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,000
 about a name, someone that you need to go and talk to,

821
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,300
 a task that he's entrusted you to do.

822
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,180
 (soft music)

823
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,860
 A challenge, something that you've put off for a while,

824
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,060
 but now the Lord is reminding you of it.

825
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,980
 Or maybe even a new, a fresh word,

826
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,420
 something that he's revealed to you

827
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,860
 in the course of the past 30 minutes or so.

828
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:45,380
 Whatever it is, this is something that literally

829
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,380
 every single person in this room,

830
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,400
 without excuse, can respond to.

831
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,700
 And that there's a task for everyone to do.

832
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,700
 There is a person, there's a situation,

833
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,300
 there's something that you can preach the word of God to

834
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,060
 in your own context, in where God has placed you.

835
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:12,620
 And so Jesus, I pray that you would reveal

836
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,820
 those things to us.

837
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,380
 We thank you for this, Lord.

838
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,620
 We thank you that you love the world so much,

839
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,380
 and not just the people who are within your church already,

840
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,360
 but our call, Lord, is to make disciples,

841
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,700
 to baptize, to glorify your name, to make it known,

842
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,700
 to tell people out there who need salvation

843
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,380
 that time is short,

844
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,260
 that life on this earth is precious and fleeting,

845
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,400
 and that Jesus will come back one day.

846
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,500
 So Lord, give us no rest until everyone

847
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,020
 is calling out your name.

848
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,700
 And help us, Lord, use us for the job of preaching your word,

849
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,300
 for the job of, for the task of, for the purpose of

850
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,020
 letting people around you, letting people around us

851
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:10,380
 know who you are, and how great and how glorious you are,

852
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,420
 but also how loving and kind you are.

853
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,820
 And use this church for this purpose, Lord.

854
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:26,700
 And family, if you would like to respond to this,

855
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,300
 I just ask you to simply stand up and say,

856
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,940
 I'm gonna do this, Lord.

857
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,580
 I'm not sure why or how or what it means exactly yet,

858
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,820
 but I'm gonna trust in you, Jesus,

859
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,300
 and I'm willing, Lord, to preach the word,

860
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,420
 to make disciples, to let people around me know about you.

861
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,940
 If you're willing to respond to that, church,

862
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,520
 I invite you to stand and worship together

863
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,760
 with your brothers and sisters around you

864
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
 to encourage each other in this journey.

865
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,500
 May God lead us and guide us and have mercy on us.

866
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,260
 We do this all in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior.

867
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,100
 Amen.

868
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,000
 (gentle music)

869
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,580
 (gentle music)

870
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,640
 you
