1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
 Thank you, Justin.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:07,360
 And yeah, so Marian and I normally sit in this section at the 915, so this is exciting

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,440
 to be part of the 1115 service, or 11, it's 11 o'clock, isn't it?

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,880
 Oh, 11 o'clock service.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,680
 And Michelle, I think she maybe slipped out, but what a gift to a church to be able to

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,480
 pour yourself out in prayer for the church.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,480
 The Vine is known as a church of prayer, and this is, like I said, where we sit, but everywhere

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,680
 you sit, wherever other section you are in, whether you're at home right now, watching

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,440
 online, we know that the Lord is a living God, and he speaks, and he has a word for

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,720
 each one of us this morning.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,800
 And that's my prayer, is that we would have the humility to hear that word, and then the

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,360
 courage to live it out, right?

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,840
 Because God wants us to go home blessed, and that's what Jesus said, "Blessed are those

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,320
 who not only hear the word, but then do the word."

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,320
 And so we'll pray for that courage for one another.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,820
 And keep praying for me as we go along.

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:17,160
 So I work now at the University of Hong Kong, and I'm helping lead up a program there called

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,500
 Faith and Global Engagement.

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,100
 And there's a number in the Vine who are also part of that program.

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,160
 Basically what the program does is it tries to put our faith, the Christian faith, into

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,480
 dialogue with contemporary society, right?

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,000
 So what does it mean in contemporary society?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 So we do that a number of ways.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 We do that through research.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,560
 We do that through classes, public lectures.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,900
 But the way that I mainly engage in is through character leadership.

27
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:53,620
 So trying to raise up the next generation of leaders as leaders of character.

28
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,000
 So I've shared a few slides in the past when I've spoken, but we'll share a couple here.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,020
 So this slide is just two weeks ago.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,580
 We had our mentor training.

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,520
 So we have 100 mentors, 110 mentors in the program.

32
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,740
 These are some of them for the training, and you might see your picture in there as well

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,420
 because some of the mentors come here from the Vine.

34
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,800
 Then if we go to the next picture, this is Lead for Life.

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 This is the program.

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,520
 So there's about 500, 550 students right now in the program.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,020
 In the next month, we're going to add about another 180 to the program.

38
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,640
 So pray for us.

39
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:39,060
 But it's exciting because what it is, it's basically saying, "How can we teach our students

40
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:47,160
 how to be with the character and the competence to build flourishing communities or to nourish

41
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,480
 flourishing communities?"

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,800
 So that's kind of the goal.

43
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,760
 The next slide shows that you cannot have character leadership without beach balls.

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,840
 Basically that's the message of that slide.

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,320
 Basically this is taken from our year-end celebration again.

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,000
 I thought about bringing some beach balls today, but then I thought, "You know, you've

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,440
 had a hard day, a hard week at work.

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,960
 You don't want to get hit by a beach ball on a Sunday morning."

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,200
 So we can talk a little bit later about beach balls and character leadership, but the reason

50
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,520
 I wanted you to see those slides is because that's where I work.

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:29,920
 And the passage that we're going to look at this morning has challenged me in my work

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
 and it's also encouraged me in my work.

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,120
 And that's my prayer for you wherever you work this morning.

54
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,400
 A couple of months ago when Allison asked if I would be a part of this series with Encounter

55
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,440
 and he said, "The topic is on Daniel."

56
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,440
 Well, Daniel is my boss at work, the name of my boss, so I had to say yes as we came

57
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,280
 in.

58
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,800
 But it's a topic and a passage you'll see about going out.

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:12,040
 I mean, last weekend with Branches of Hope and Alex did a beautiful job of what it means

60
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:20,360
 to not just stay here in the box of our church, but that we go out.

61
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,480
 And that's really what the Vine is.

62
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,720
 Four years ago when Marian and I joined this church, we were attracted to the river, that

63
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,760
 we go out, that we don't stay here in the church.

64
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,320
 We don't only express our faith in our church and in our small groups.

65
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,160
 There is a mathematician at Oxford, John Lennox, and he's a brilliant man.

66
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,400
 If you want to YouTube him, he has just beautiful expositions of the faith.

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,680
 He's a mathematician and he's written a book on Daniel called Against the Flow.

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,200
 And one of the things he talks about in Daniel is he says this.

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,840
 He says, "Daniel, from the time he was a teenager and he was forcefully removed from his home

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,480
 to a foreign land until the time he was post-80, the whole of that life he managed to have

71
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,960
 his faith on the edge."

72
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,600
 But then he said this, "But too many of us, we live in the boxes of our church, we live

73
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,960
 in the boxes of our home and our faith is only at home or the church.

74
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,040
 And it never gets out to where we spend most of our time."

75
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,980
 So that's the message this morning is to challenge us to take it out.

76
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,560
 How does our faith and work relate together?

77
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,840
 And I know that's tough.

78
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,040
 I started my professional career with a company that's now called Accenture as a consultant.

79
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,580
 And living out your faith at work is tough.

80
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,400
 It's tough at the university.

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,960
 It's tough in whatever area God has called you.

82
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,600
 So where do you spend the majority of your time?

83
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 Think about that.

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,340
 It might be at home working.

85
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,260
 It might be working out of the home.

86
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,480
 It might be in a school.

87
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,280
 It might be your work right now is as a student.

88
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,040
 It might be that you're in a lab.

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,440
 It might be you're in a studio.

90
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:24,780
 But wherever it is, what would it mean to fully express your faith through that work?

91
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,060
 And that's what we're going to look at.

92
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,060
 Now that's risky.

93
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,720
 It got Daniel in a lot of trouble.

94
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,780
 So the question is, do we want to read this passage or not?

95
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,460
 You want to read it?

96
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,260
 Okay, so we want to read it and we want to hear it, but do we want to do it?

97
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,220
 That's a yes too.

98
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
 That's going to take courage.

99
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,220
 So let's look at it together.

100
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,900
 We're going to look at this passage, the whole of Daniel 6 together.

101
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,900
 And Daniel 6 divides beautifully into three parts.

102
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,060
 So I want you to imagine with me, this is like a Netflix docu-series, right?

103
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,860
 And we have three episodes coming together.

104
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,020
 It's kind of like the Simone Biles docu-series, right?

105
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,500
 But you don't have to wait until October to find the ending, right?

106
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,660
 It's here.

107
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,060
 And in this docu-series, you have kind of the courage of Simone.

108
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,660
 You've got a little bit of the office episodes mixed in.

109
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:31,860
 But you have the whole story of Daniel and what does it mean in his faith and his work,

110
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,860
 right?

111
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:39,300
 And with this, some of us kind of know Daniel from maybe the Daniel Diet.

112
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,700
 You remember the Daniel Diet?

113
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
 Yeah?

114
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
 Okay.

115
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,700
 So maybe we heard about Daniel Diet.

116
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,060
 It was a vegetarian diet, basically.

117
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,980
 Others know us from this chapter, Daniel and the Lion's Den, right?

118
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,700
 And clearly the diet worked well because in Daniel and the Lion's Den, he's about 80 years

119
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,200
 old, right?

120
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,100
 And he's going strong.

121
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:06,180
 He's served under two national leaders already, and he's serving now under a third.

122
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,820
 So we're going to read through this passage together.

123
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,700
 And as we do, what I ask is really we ask just one question.

124
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,380
 And that question is actually one we ask every week here at the Vine.

125
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:27,260
 What does the scripture over 2,500 years earlier have to say to us today?

126
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:34,820
 The context of it is Babylonia is the superpower of the world at that time.

127
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,340
 They've come down.

128
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,140
 They've basically desecrated and sacked Jerusalem.

129
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,700
 They've taken the teenagers of the elite families, the elite of the elite, because then they're

130
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,300
 going to take them, they're going to put them in a leadership training program in Babylonia.

131
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,140
 That's part of their enculturation.

132
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,540
 Daniel was one of those.

133
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,760
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were his friends.

134
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,700
 They were sent there as teenagers.

135
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,900
 At this point where we're reading, Daniel is about 80 years old.

136
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
 So we can look at it together.

137
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,020
 You can see it on your screen.

138
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,660
 If you brought your Bible, you can open it up, follow along.

139
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,060
 If you have your Bible on your phone and you want to mark it with there, sometimes I find

140
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,860
 that helpful as well.

141
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,540
 But let's look at this first episode.

142
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:29,780
 So Daniel 6, it pleased Darius the king to set over the kingdom 120 satraps.

143
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,740
 Satraps sounds quite exotic, sounds like kind of something from the Dune movie.

144
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,100
 But basically these are government officials, administrators.

145
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,420
 And there was 120 of them over the whole kingdom.

146
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,780
 And over these, there were three high officials of whom Daniel was one, and to whom these

147
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,460
 satraps should give account so that the king might suffer no loss.

148
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,820
 So what basically he's saying here, he's giving us the whole org chart.

149
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,100
 So we know where Daniel is in his position at work.

150
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:08,740
 In this, Daniel became distinguished among all the other high officials and satraps because,

151
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,820
 and you can mark this, an excellent spirit was in him.

152
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,460
 And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.

153
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,460
 So he had a great future.

154
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,100
 And then the high officials and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against

155
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:28,420
 Daniel with regard to the kingdom, but they could find no ground for complaint or any

156
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,340
 fault because he was faithful.

157
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,700
 No error or fault was found in him.

158
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,580
 And then these men said, "We shall not find any ground for a complaint against this Daniel

159
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,980
 unless it's in connection with the law of God."

160
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,300
 In other words, this is where the faith and work comes into play.

161
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,140
 And then these officials and satraps, high officials and satraps, came by agreement to

162
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,420
 the king and they said to him, "Oh, King Darius, live forever.

163
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,980
 All of the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors,

164
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,060
 the governors, all are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce

165
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,820
 an injunction that whoever makes petition or prays to any God or man for 30 days except

166
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,180
 to you, oh king, shall be cast into the den of lions.

167
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,540
 Now king, establish the law and sign the document so that it cannot be changed according to

168
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,060
 the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked.

169
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,380
 And therefore King Darius, sign the document and the injunction."

170
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,180
 Okay, so we'll pause there for a little bit because what we see is the trap has been set,

171
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
 right?

172
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,660
 The trap has been set for Daniel.

173
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:44,340
 We see Daniel in the faith and work and basically what we're looking at is what is this section

174
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,900
 that we've just read, what does that teach us?

175
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,860
 What's it about?

176
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,980
 And we kind of already know what it's about in terms it's about our faith and our work.

177
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,500
 It's basically how our Sunday relates to our Monday.

178
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,660
 It's like what you're doing right now, what will you be doing at 11, 30 or 12 o'clock

179
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,180
 tomorrow.

180
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,420
 It's about what the monks would talk about, aura and labora, prayer and labor coming together

181
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,020
 in a fully integrated way.

182
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,620
 And I think most of us want that in our workplace.

183
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,060
 Question is, how do we do it?

184
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,060
 How do we do it?

185
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,900
 And so Daniel gives us a really nice model here.

186
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,500
 And it's a model like any model that you have to adapt to your area, but it's the model

187
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 that we found in that verse that I called to our attention in verse 3, because an excellent

188
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,780
 spirit was in him.

189
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,300
 An excellent spirit was in him.

190
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,420
 You know, we're talking about Alpha.

191
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,500
 I love Alpha.

192
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 I think Pat is one of my heroes.

193
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,740
 She heads up Alpha here in Hong Kong.

194
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,180
 Every church I've been in, we've led Alpha.

195
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,140
 I am so excited about the new Faith and Work Alpha that's coming out.

196
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,700
 It's going to be brilliant.

197
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,620
 But when people ask me, because I know I'm about faith and work, when people ask me,

198
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,860
 "Okay, how does you integrate your faith and your work?"

199
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,620
 Basically it's you do a good job, right?

200
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,620
 The evangelism will come, but the basic way is that you do an excellent job.

201
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,620
 That's why you were hired.

202
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,060
 I wasn't hired to evangelize.

203
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,220
 I was hired to do a good job.

204
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,420
 But then as we do a good job, as we show up and do the best we can, as we pray for the

205
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,940
 spirit of excellence, then we have a little credibility to talk and to share our story.

206
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,320
 So I think that's the first thing that Daniel kind of pulls out.

207
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,260
 And we can see that his distractors, his people who are working against him for whatever reason,

208
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:48,620
 they couldn't find any fault in his work because it was excellent work.

209
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,700
 Now I know I've lived in Hong Kong, Marian and I, since 2009, so I know preaching to

210
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,100
 a congregation in Hong Kong about doing excellent work is like, "Yeah, I've been told that since

211
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
 the beginning."

212
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,100
 Right?

213
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:09,860
 And this is not just about doing, you know, crushing your KPIs or whatever that.

214
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,660
 This is not about doing that work only the excellent work.

215
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
 It is that.

216
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
 It is showing up.

217
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,220
 And this is one of the things we tell our students.

218
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,420
 Show up, do the best you can do.

219
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,300
 But there's something more going on here, right?

220
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:31,100
 And the something more that's going on is he's called to a spirit of excellence.

221
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:39,300
 And this word excellence comes from the word, you know, like when we see it later in 2 Peter,

222
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,900
 the word virtue, virtues build up our character, right?

223
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,020
 So you have the virtue of courage.

224
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,020
 You have the virtue of resilience.

225
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,980
 You have the virtue of kindness.

226
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,200
 And you can become those things.

227
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,980
 Your character you can change.

228
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,060
 Certain things you can't change, but your character can change.

229
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,220
 Now what's interesting is when you go back to the original, like Greek, in terms of what

230
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,820
 is the word for virtue, it's the word arete.

231
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,060
 And the word arete means excellence.

232
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,140
 So what the writers are telling us is a couple of things.

233
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,820
 Yes, Daniel was doing an excellent job in terms of the work, but it was how he was doing

234
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
 it.

235
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,300
 Daniel is a leader of character.

236
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,700
 And that's my challenge for us this morning, is that when we leave this place, that we

237
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,740
 have this sense of what would it look like for you to be a leader of character in your

238
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,620
 place of work?

239
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,540
 And you might be thinking, well, Steve, I'm not really a leader in my work, or that's

240
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,220
 going to be challenging for a lot of reasons.

241
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,780
 But at the university, we define lead for life in the program, we define it as influencing

242
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,380
 towards a goal.

243
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,580
 Everyone's a leader, and you can all influence towards a goal.

244
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,620
 But what would it look like to do that through your character?

245
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,340
 But it goes more.

246
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,060
 It's not just excellent character.

247
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,620
 It's a spirit of excellence.

248
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:08,180
 And this is where we see again and again in this passage that it's the faith of Daniel.

249
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,420
 It's your faith.

250
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,940
 It's the spirit of God in you.

251
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:19,180
 And so as you pray and think about what would it look like for me to be said of me that

252
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,420
 you had the spirit of excellence, for someone to say of you, you had the spirit of excellence.

253
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,620
 And there's a spiritual side.

254
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,700
 There's a calling to it.

255
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:37,180
 But one thing it means is that your people at work need to know you're a Christian, if

256
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,180
 you are a Christian.

257
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,180
 Right?

258
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,740
 They need to know you're a believer.

259
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:47,020
 What we'll see in this passage is that everybody knows Daniel is a person of faith.

260
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,160
 Our faith is personal, but it's also public.

261
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,780
 And that's one part that Daniel shows us.

262
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:59,020
 So we have this model of excellence, a spirit of excellence.

263
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,700
 And what would that look like in your work?

264
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,420
 Is this making a little sense?

265
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,420
 Yeah?

266
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,420
 We're tracking?

267
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
 Yeah?

268
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
 Okay.

269
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,940
 Now, did you notice something we were reading?

270
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,300
 I know it was a long passage in the middle of a Sunday, but did you notice something

271
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,260
 that his distractors, one of my friends calls them misbehaviors.

272
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,620
 The people, you know, you're good, but you're just misbehaving.

273
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:25,260
 So they're misbehaviors who were after Daniel.

274
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,820
 They had to lie in order to catch Daniel and lay the trap.

275
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,860
 Did you see that in verse 7?

276
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,020
 They're going to the king, and it says they talked before they went to the king.

277
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,540
 You know, they were conspiring together, and they go before the king, and then they say

278
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,700
 basically all of the officials agree.

279
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,780
 Right?

280
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,580
 But the writer's already given us the org chart.

281
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,100
 We know that Daniel was one of the high officials.

282
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,900
 I don't think Daniel was consulted in this.

283
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,460
 Right?

284
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,740
 Now I don't know if it's encouraging to you or not or discouraging to you that 2,500 years

285
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,420
 ago there was already office politics.

286
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,780
 Right?

287
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:10,500
 It says something about the human heart, right, of what we are.

288
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,260
 But let me tell you something that I've found.

289
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:19,060
 Sometimes when I find myself in a sin or something that I've done wrong, I've missed the mark

290
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:24,660
 or whatever, one of the things I recognize is that somewhere along the line I bought

291
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
 a lie.

292
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,860
 If something's not kind of going right, and you know it's not going right, there's injustice

293
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,660
 going on, we don't know why these guys are against Daniel, we don't know if it's because

294
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,900
 they're jealous, we don't know because they're afraid, we don't know if there's some racism.

295
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,500
 We'll hear later they talk about he's in exile.

296
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:51,100
 We don't know why, but what I found is that when I'm in a situation, whether I'm doing

297
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,740
 or someone else is doing, there's a lie somewhere.

298
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,180
 And so I ask to see the lie.

299
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,500
 And it makes sense if you think about it, right?

300
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,500
 Because the devil is the father of lies.

301
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,980
 And so the lie is going to come somewhere.

302
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,700
 But on the other hand, Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.

303
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,620
 And the truth sets us free.

304
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,740
 If you're in a situation, this is just an aside, one thing I do is I just pray, "God,

305
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,140
 show me what lie I bought.

306
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,100
 Maybe I bought a lie earlier that said I deserve more.

307
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,700
 Maybe that was the lie.

308
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,380
 But what lie did I buy that's in this situation?"

309
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,940
 And then shine the truth so that we can move on and out of this.

310
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,100
 Okay, so that's just an aside.

311
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,460
 We're going to go on to the next section.

312
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
 Is that clear?

313
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,460
 Yeah?

314
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
 Everybody good?

315
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,580
 Okay, so you might want to turn to your neighbor, wake up your neighbor, say, "Second, I'm

316
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,580
 going to go to the next section."

317
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,580
 The second episode gets better.

318
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,740
 We should have got popcorn, and we're going to go on to the next.

319
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,740
 Okay?

320
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,060
 Okay, so let's go on to the next section as we read.

321
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,940
 Carry on with Daniel.

322
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,140
 Verse 10 says this, "When Daniel knew that the document had been signed."

323
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,060
 Okay, so I just want to give you a little bit of a heads up what's going on in this

324
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
 section.

325
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,660
 "No matter what's going on in your workplace, no matter what's going on in your home, no

326
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:14,100
 matter what struggle you're going through, you always have the choice of how you respond."

327
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,740
 So what we're going to see is how did Daniel respond in this situation.

328
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,740
 "When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had

329
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,980
 windows in his upper chamber open towards Jerusalem."

330
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,420
 You can kind of note that phrase.

331
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:33,140
 "Then he got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his

332
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,300
 God as he has done previously.

333
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,220
 And then these men came by agreement, and they found Daniel making a petition and plea

334
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,620
 before his God."

335
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,020
 He was praying.

336
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:50,220
 "Then they came near and said before the king concerning the injunction, 'O king, did you

337
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:57,420
 not sign an injunction that anyone who makes petition to any God or man within 30 days

338
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,860
 except to you, O king, should be cast into the den of lions?'

339
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,620
 And the king answered and said," he's quite proud of this law, "he said, 'The thing stands

340
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:12,460
 fast according to the law of Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.'

341
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,940
 Then they," these distractors, these misbehaviors, "say, 'Then they answered and said before

342
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:27,540
 the king, 'Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king,

343
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:32,820
 for the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.'"

344
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:39,820
 And then the king, when he hears these words, was much distressed.

345
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,420
 You can kind of imagine, right?

346
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:47,060
 The king is thinking, "Oh shoot, I forgot about Daniel," right?

347
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,020
 And now he's distressed, and what does it do?

348
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,420
 And this is a beautiful line.

349
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,620
 It says, "He labored until the sun went down to rescue him."

350
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,020
 In other words, what the king is doing is he's looking for every legal loophole to get

351
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,540
 Daniel out of trouble before sundown comes, right?

352
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,500
 But sundown comes, and then the people come back, and they, men by agreement, come to

353
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,620
 the king, they say to the king, "Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians

354
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,980
 that no injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed."

355
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,820
 And then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought in, cast into the den of lions, the

356
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:29,140
 king declared to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you."

357
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,140
 That's a beautiful line, right?

358
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:37,180
 This is the king, this is the boss talking, and he knows Daniel's faith.

359
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:44,740
 And he says to him, "May your God, whom you continually serve, save you."

360
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,700
 And a stone was brought, laid on the mouth, denned, king sealed it with his own signet,

361
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,700
 "Signet of the Lord's, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel."

362
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,500
 And then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting.

363
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,420
 No diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.

364
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,540
 I love the relationship between Daniel and the king.

365
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,980
 You're going to see more of it in the next session.

366
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,380
 But basically, what we see here is how did Daniel respond, right?

367
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,220
 What did he do?

368
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:23,260
 He knows he's been trapped, he knows he's going to the lion's den.

369
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,820
 Verse 10, what does he do?

370
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:31,400
 Do you remember some time ago, there was a campaign that was kind of resurrected, renewed

371
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:38,460
 from World War II Britain, and it had t-shirts and it had all types of signs.

372
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,700
 It was the one that said, "Stay calm and carry on," right?

373
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
 You remember that?

374
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,860
 I mean, there are all types of kind of parodies of that going out, but that's basically what

375
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,620
 Daniel does.

376
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,940
 Daniel basically says, I mean, he stays calm and he carries on.

377
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:02,460
 That might be something for us in terms of our situations, whatever those might be.

378
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,140
 So he does that, but what does that mean for him?

379
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,940
 And what that means for him is that he goes and he prays three times a day.

380
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,140
 Why is he praying three times a day?

381
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,940
 Psalm 55 says, "I pray to you, Lord, morning, noon, and night."

382
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,180
 He's living that out.

383
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,860
 He's living the word out.

384
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,580
 Why are the windows open?

385
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,940
 You know, the writer goes to great attention to open windows.

386
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,860
 Why are the windows open?

387
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,380
 Because hundreds of years earlier when Solomon had built the temple and he consecrated, he

388
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,740
 prayed over the temple, and he knew that one day people wouldn't be able to come to the

389
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,700
 temple, and so he prayed for those who were out of the country that they would pray towards

390
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,940
 the temple.

391
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:52,020
 And so what became a sign, a physical, tangible sign of a faithful exile, because again, Daniel's

392
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
 an exile.

393
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,540
 He was taken forcefully into exile.

394
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:01,460
 What became that sign is praying with open windows towards Jerusalem.

395
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,220
 So here's my question.

396
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,820
 What are your open windows towards Jerusalem?

397
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:15,100
 What are the tangible things that point you towards God in your workplace?

398
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,340
 Now I'm going to be honest with you.

399
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,460
 I might have closed those windows for 30 days, right?

400
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,860
 But Daniel did it.

401
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,760
 He had these open windows, you know, and it was so open that the distractors knew they

402
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,700
 could come and they could see him.

403
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,540
 And they could, you know, this day they'd probably take a picture, they'd WhatsApp the

404
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,020
 king or whatever, but they can see him.

405
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,420
 But Daniel was faithful to that.

406
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:44,940
 What are your, in your workplace, what are some reminders for you that help you remember

407
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,460
 who and whose you are?

408
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,860
 I'll give you some examples.

409
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:53,100
 If I have a friend who has kind of an alarm set every day to 3 p.m., he schedules his

410
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,780
 day around 3 p.m.

411
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,020
 At 3 p.m. the alarm goes off and he prays.

412
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,820
 That's his way of basically reminding himself that the work he's doing, the fruitfulness,

413
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,380
 is only going to come from God, the lasting fruitfulness.

414
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,740
 Another friend, he's an executive of a global company, automotive company in Switzerland,

415
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
 massive office.

416
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,100
 He's got one of those offices with the big credenza down the back and the big desk.

417
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:23,700
 And on the credenza at the back is basically a Bible open to Proverbs.

418
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:31,980
 That's his way of saying, "I want my decisions for this global company to be wise ones and

419
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,220
 to be the wisdom from above."

420
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,300
 For me, I have things on my desk, I have a little prayer book that helps remind me what

421
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,020
 could be yours or what are yours.

422
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,940
 And if they're not yours, what could you do right now or today, this week, to start putting

423
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,260
 those into practice?

424
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,580
 But I love what it says here.

425
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,420
 It says in the prayer, "He prayed because this was his habit," right?

426
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,020
 And it's praised three times a day.

427
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,820
 And then it says, "He prayed and gave thanks to God."

428
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,980
 So I want to think about that word "thanks" with you for a moment because whatever situation

429
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,300
 you are in, there is something to be thankful for.

430
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,020
 Last couple of years, it's been a really tough one in our family for a number of different

431
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,540
 ways for both Marian and I and our extended families.

432
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:25,200
 My mom died during the time of COVID, not of COVID, but she died during that time.

433
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,140
 My dad passed away last year, about this time, almost exactly last year.

434
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:37,860
 Dad really took a turn for the worse and I left the work program and went to be back

435
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,100
 with him in Austin with my brothers.

436
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:48,740
 He was in the hospital when we were there and my brothers and I took time sleeping and

437
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:56,760
 exchanging off during the shifts, sleeping there in the hospital room.

438
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,520
 And I was there probably about eight, ten days, something like that.

439
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,840
 But most of the time that I was there, dad was either sleeping or he was not coherent

440
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,320
 when he was coming to.

441
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,480
 Now, dad was 96, man of God, a Daniel in his own right, a scientist that had done amazing

442
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,000
 work in his life.

443
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,860
 And I was just there and I was praying to God, "God, give me some time, some moment

444
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,680
 that when he's coherent that I can be here with him."

445
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:33,320
 And sure enough, the night before I was scheduled to come back to Hong Kong on like a Tuesday,

446
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,240
 on that Monday night, it was kind of my shift.

447
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,440
 My brother had gone down to get some supper downstairs and then he joined us afterwards.

448
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:47,120
 But during that time, dad woke up and he was coherent.

449
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,520
 And so he kind of came to and then he's like, "Where am I?"

450
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,800
 And I said the name of the hospital and he said, "Oh, no."

451
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,840
 Because he'd been in that hospital before, he didn't like that hospital.

452
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,400
 And then he said, "Is it bad?"

453
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,280
 And I said, "Yes, it is."

454
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:15,760
 And then he said, it's a very direct question as a scientist, he said, "Am I going to die?"

455
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,200
 And I said, "Well, we thought we had lost you over the weekend."

456
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,040
 And then he kind of paused.

457
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,520
 And you can imagine, I mean, tubes coming all out of him, hooked up to all these machines,

458
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,680
 machines all over the place.

459
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:38,080
 And he kind of looks at me and he says, "There's a lot to be thankful for."

460
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,400
 So that is a leader of character.

461
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
 That is Daniel.

462
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,120
 That is what Daniel is doing.

463
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,040
 Daniel's going in the midst of this and saying, "There's a lot to be thankful for."

464
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,520
 And I know that's tough, right?

465
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,760
 I know that's tough to find things to be thankful for.

466
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,560
 Earlier in this year, I had some surgery on my face.

467
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,000
 I had something that needed to be taken off my nose.

468
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,480
 And so I had this big surgery.

469
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,040
 They had to put something on my face, which kind of looked like a big one of those egg

470
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,360
 sushis or something like that, stepped in.

471
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,760
 It was unbelievable, right?

472
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,640
 And so I'm thinking, "How can I be thankful for this?"

473
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,480
 Because I'm speaking, I'm doing these other things.

474
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,720
 But then I was thinking, "I can be thankful for this because, well, Mary and my wife,

475
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,680
 she still looked at me and I was okay with that.

476
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,040
 And she was there going through it with me."

477
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:32,600
 And maybe that's what we can be thankful for, is that you've got someone to go through this

478
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
 with you.

479
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,320
 And if you don't, reach out, we'll go through with you.

480
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,880
 And that, there's always something to be thankful for.

481
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,520
 In fact, there's a lot to be thankful for.

482
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,760
 One of my nephews made a plaque and sent it out to all dad's grandkids and great-grandkids

483
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,960
 and extended family with, "There's a lot to be thankful for."

484
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,240
 I want to go on now and finish up the passage.

485
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,760
 But before I do, I don't want us to miss something that's very important here.

486
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,840
 And that is that Daniel had habits, right?

487
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,680
 He had habits that were good habits.

488
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:14,280
 And good habits will hold you in bad times.

489
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:20,040
 Good habits will hold you in bad times, but you can't wait till the lion den come to start

490
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
 those habits.

491
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,160
 It says here that Daniel went and looked previously, he did what he did previously.

492
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,440
 It was already a habit.

493
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,800
 And our research today shows he had the two best habits in the world, in terms of gratitude,

494
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,720
 what that does for you, in terms of strengthening you, and also prayer.

495
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,160
 And let me just reinforce that.

496
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,320
 That habit of daily consistent prayer, if you don't have it, put it into place.

497
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,880
 As a pastor in a local church for many, many years, you know, sometimes couples would come

498
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,600
 to me and they would be in a bad situation in their life, and between the two of them,

499
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,800
 the relationship was not strong.

500
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,580
 And one of the times when I would talk to them, or several, at some point when I would

501
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,320
 talk to them, I would ask them, "Are you still able to pray?"

502
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,800
 Because I know how tough it is to pray during those times.

503
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,960
 And Mary and I have been married 41 years.

504
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,960
 And along the way, we've learned this habit of praying, just little prayers.

505
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,000
 So it's basically, before we go to bed at night, we'll just say a little prayer for

506
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 each other.

507
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,640
 And, you know, if I pray too long, Marian falls asleep, you know.

508
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,200
 So the secret is keep it short, you know.

509
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,480
 But that's the habit that will hold you when the times are bad.

510
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
 Don't wait.

511
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,560
 Start today.

512
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,880
 Whatever those habits are, put them into place because when something comes, that will

513
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 help hold you.

514
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
 Amen?

515
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
 Okay.

516
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
 Still okay?

517
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
 Still good?

518
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,400
 Need to wake up the other neighbor on the other side?

519
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
 Yeah?

520
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
 Okay.

521
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,760
 Tell that person it gets better, the lions are coming, and Steve might share something

522
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
 personal encounter.

523
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
 Okay.

524
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,800
 So let's go through the last part here as we look up and finish up.

525
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:21,080
 Okay, so, "Then at the break of day, the king rose and went in haste to the den of

526
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
 lions.

527
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,600
 And as he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish.

528
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,440
 The king declared to Daniel, 'Oh, Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God whom

529
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,800
 you serve continually been able to deliver you from the lions?'"

530
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,720
 I just love that.

531
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,480
 You know, the king doesn't even want to see because he's afraid of what he's going to

532
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
 see.

533
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,960
 So he cries from a distance.

534
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,400
 And then Daniel calls back and he says, "Then Daniel said to the king, 'Oh, king, live forever.

535
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,800
 My God sent his angel and shut the lion's mouth, and they have not harmed me because

536
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,360
 I was found blameless before him and also before you.

537
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,280
 Oh, king, I have done no harm.'

538
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,520
 And then the king was exceedingly glad."

539
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,200
 You know, I love this relationship between the two.

540
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,440
 I just believe that Daniel was praying some of those times for his boss.

541
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,960
 He was praying for his boss.

542
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,080
 Do you pray for your boss?

543
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,920
 Do you pray good things for your boss?

544
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,560
 Okay, keep praying those good things.

545
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,620
 It works, right?

546
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,280
 We see this relationship here.

547
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,920
 "The king was exceedingly glad and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den.

548
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:46,720
 And so Daniel was taken up out of the den and no kind of harm was found on him.

549
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,480
 Mark this however you can mark it in your heart with a pen, because he had trusted in

550
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,040
 his God.

551
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,040
 And the king commanded, and those men who had," and the king commanded, "and those men

552
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,480
 who had maliciously," these are the misbehaviors, "accused Daniel were brought and cast into

553
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,800
 the den of lions.

554
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,640
 They, their children, and their wives," this is where the rating of the docuseries goes

555
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,120
 way up, "and before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and

556
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,920
 broke all their bones in pieces."

557
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,400
 Okay, this is kind of hard, right?

558
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:26,280
 But I think what the writer is telling us is it's not because the lions weren't hungry

559
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,160
 they didn't eat Daniel.

560
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,880
 There's something else, and he wants to make that clear.

561
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,880
 And then the king Darius wrote to all the people, nations and languages, and received

562
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,680
 this as a blessing given to you.

563
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,160
 Peace be multiplied to you.

564
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,120
 "I make a decree that in all my royal dominion people are to tremble in fear before the God

565
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,040
 of Daniel, for he is a living God, enduring forever.

566
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,560
 His kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end.

567
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,080
 He delivers and rescues.

568
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,560
 He works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth.

569
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,480
 He who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions," and you might put your name in

570
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,920
 there, "He who has saved you from whatever power that you're working against."

571
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,560
 So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyprus, the Persian.

572
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,240
 Okay, I need to wrap up here.

573
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,160
 But I want to say a few things as we close, which are really important.

574
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:35,400
 And the first thing is, is if we leave this place today and we think, "Okay, Steve, got

575
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,880
 it, I'm going to go home, I'm going to open my windows, I'm going to start praying three

576
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:48,120
 times a day, and it's all going to work out well," then we've missed the point.

577
00:36:48,120 --> 00:37:00,480
 The point is what we marked earlier, because Daniel had trusted God.

578
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:08,080
 I pray and hope that whatever you're going through will have this amazingly beyond expectations

579
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,100
 and Ephesians, we talk about more than we can imagine.

580
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,680
 This powerful ending is beautiful.

581
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,740
 It's a display of God's splendor going out.

582
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:22,680
 But that's the result, and the result we leave to God.

583
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,040
 And this is where Daniel's friends, remember Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who were

584
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,840
 also teenagers, and if you're young here today, step into this, okay?

585
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,360
 Because Daniel used his whole life to display the splendor of God.

586
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,560
 And if you're older, like myself, there's still time.

587
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,160
 I'm not 80 yet, right?

588
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,360
 And we can work with it.

589
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:50,080
 But what we see here is that the trust of his friends.

590
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,720
 I want to read a passage from chapter 3.

591
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,800
 This is Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

592
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,760
 Earlier, the king has laid up a big image of gold and said, "Either you worship this

593
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,640
 image or I'm going to put you in the fiery furnace."

594
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,480
 And this is their response.

595
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:12,360
 "If we," the three said, "are thrown into a blazing furnace, the God we serve is able

596
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,400
 to save us from it, and He will rescue us from your hand, O king.

597
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,480
 But even if He does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or

598
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,900
 worship the image of gold you have set up."

599
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,840
 That's a leader of character.

600
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:37,320
 That's someone who gets it that what we do is we do the right thing.

601
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,720
 And what we do is we trust the results to God, because that's a much bigger story than

602
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
 we have.

603
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
 Amen?

604
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,720
 So this word "trust" is one I want to leave you with.

605
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,160
 And you know, it's one as beginning of a new year, often our family will choose a word

606
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,960
 for that year to focus on.

607
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,200
 It was New York a couple of years ago, and I chose the word "trust."

608
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:08,440
 Usually my words last until about February, but I'm still writing down "trust" at the

609
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:17,040
 top of my prayer journal every day, because trust is what – this is really what it's

610
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
 about.

611
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,560
 It's about trusting Jesus.

612
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:27,080
 I want to come to that last slide on trusting Jesus, because Dallas Willard basically said,

613
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:32,520
 "We can sum up the whole of the gospel in two words, and it's these two words."

614
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:40,120
 It's just in trust in Jesus is where we're at, because it's a personal thing.

615
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,280
 And I love that.

616
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,880
 You know, the word "pistis faith," it basically just means trust.

617
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,800
 And because I trust Jesus and you trust Jesus, we can have a relationship of trust ourselves.

618
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,640
 It doesn't matter if you believe differently in a doctrine than I do.

619
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,960
 It's this trusting Jesus.

620
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,600
 It's a personal and a public thing.

621
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,600
 So let me finish just with a little personal story.

622
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,920
 It's an encounter of high time I first met Jesus.

623
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:17,520
 It was in Zaria, Nigeria, a little town in northern Nigeria, and I was 17 years old,

624
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,280
 not a believer.

625
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,080
 And the story actually starts about two weeks earlier.

626
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,640
 This was on – two weeks earlier, we'd been to a conference.

627
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,960
 It was a big conference room like this.

628
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,160
 I was sitting way in the back, causing kind of trouble.

629
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,800
 My mom was down here.

630
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,320
 There was a speaker up here.

631
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,720
 The speaker began to speak.

632
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,200
 There was something in what he said.

633
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,800
 The Holy Spirit empowered him, and I just felt that on myself.

634
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,240
 I felt the presence of love, and I felt myself listening, and I felt myself changing.

635
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,360
 And then it was over.

636
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
 I don't know what he said.

637
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,200
 I don't even know the speaker.

638
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,840
 Went out that night, 17-year-old, nonbeliever, still got in trouble, and had some, you know,

639
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
 some fun.

640
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,920
 Came in late that night, and then my mom was still up.

641
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,600
 My mom was sitting up here at the conference.

642
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
 I was back there.

643
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,520
 Mom, when I walked in, she said, "Something happened to you tonight, didn't it?"

644
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,160
 And I said, "Yes, it did."

645
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,680
 And she said, "Do you know what it was?"

646
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,680
 And I said, "No."

647
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,920
 And she said, "Okay."

648
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:26,720
 And then we went to bed, because mom had all the wisdom to know to give God space to work.

649
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,680
 And two weeks later, God worked.

650
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,400
 I felt the same presence in the room.

651
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,880
 I got up, and I just felt God's there.

652
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
 And I said, "Yes."

653
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,400
 And from then till now, trying the best I can, and we're all works in progress to trust

654
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,560
 God daily.

655
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,800
 Thomas Merton says, "One thing I know, if you're there when the Spirit dances, dance."

656
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,360
 So if you feel God speaking to you in any way about wanting that living relationship

657
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,200
 or something at work, dance.

658
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,440
 Say yes.

659
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,760
 What would it look like for you to trust God more?

660
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,480
 What would it look like for you to trust your whole life completely to God if you've not

661
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
 done that?

662
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,880
 Let's close in prayer.

663
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:19,960
 And I'm going to invite us just to have a moment of just prayer between you and God.

664
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,720
 I don't need to lead this.

665
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,840
 But maybe you want to start with Daniel and just say a word of thanks.

666
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,440
 Thank you, God, that I'm here.

667
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,480
 Thank you, God, that...

668
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,480
 And then...

669
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:50,360
 Begin to talk with him about what it would look like for a spirit of excellence for you.

670
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:56,800
 What would it look like to develop good habits today?

671
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,640
 What would it look like to trust Him more?

672
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,000
