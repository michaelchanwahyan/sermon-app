[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   - Hey guys, Pastor John and Sandra,
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.320]   they've been with us for a long time.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.440]   He's one of our founding pastors, if you didn't know.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.600]   And I hear that you are taking a few months off
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.240]   to spend time with family in UK.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.840]   And so actually to have them with us today,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.640]   it's a joy.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.360]   And so I'm gonna pray for John, I'm gonna pray for us.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.620]   So pray with us.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.400]   Father, we thank you for John and Sandra.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.840]   We thank you for not just the ministry that they've given,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720]   Lord God, but their lives.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.560]   Lord God, thank you for saving them many, many years ago
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.880]   and thank you for using them.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.480]   Thank you for continuing to remind us through them
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360]   what your love looks like,
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.520]   how to live faithfully in this world
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.760]   that seems getting, it seems more and more complex,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.760]   Lord God.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.800]   But today here we are and we ask, Lord God,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.600]   for you to speak your living words through your servant,
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.840]   John, your friend, John, our brother, John, our pastor, John.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.880]   And so Jesus, we're excited and we receive this with joy
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.040]   and anticipation.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.920]   Holy Spirit, would you move through all of us.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.040]   In your name we pray, amen.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.880]   - Amen.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.320]   Let's go have a hug.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.800]   Thank you.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.220]   You know, it's possible to overdose
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.240]   on church services and religion.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.600]   Look at my own story.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.200]   I didn't come from a Christian family,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.160]   but I was sent to Christian schools,
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.800]   Christian primary school and Christian secondary school.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.680]   And one of the things about schools,
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.840]   particularly in the UK at that time,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.240]   was that every day had to start
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.520]   with an act of Christian assembly.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.920]   Don't ask me what they said, I can't remember any of it,
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.840]   but I did calculate that I probably attended
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.700]   2,500 plus assemblies.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.120]   Now, the only days we didn't do assemblies
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.420]   was special days like Saint's Days or Thanksgiving,
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.700]   where we went to church.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.700]   And I recall my primary school was called St. Peter's School
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.820]   and it was St. Peter's Day.
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.640]   And so we went to St. Peter's Church.
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.700]   But it had come just after my birthday
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.960]   and I'd recently started supporting a football team,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.200]   a soccer team for you Americans, called Tottenham Hotspur.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.720]   And someone had bought me a Tottenham Hotspur diary.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.560]   And I decided that a Tottenham Hotspur diary
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.920]   was a lot more interesting to read
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.320]   than the church service was.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.400]   Unfortunately, my headmaster did not agree.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.680]   So when we got back to the school,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.960]   I was called into his room and as happened in those days,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.880]   he got his stick out and two strokes of the cane.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.040]   And I thought to myself, man,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.660]   this was so much more interesting than the church service.
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.840]   And for many years, I had this feeling
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.160]   that God was like this.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.660]   God was like a headmaster who was waiting
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.840]   to see what I did wrong.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   The other thing about those services at that time,
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.440]   the assemblies and the services,
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.960]   they use words I did not understand.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   Words like omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.480]   If you play Scrabble, that's a lot of points,
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.520]   I've got to tell you.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.180]   Now I later learned that omniscient means all knowing.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.360]   Omnipresent means all present.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.960]   Why didn't they just say all present?
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.280]   Omnipotent meant all powerful.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.880]   Now, why do I bring this up?
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.880]   Well, today I have selected Psalm 139.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.680]   I guess you've gathered that by now.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.760]   I love this Psalm.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.200]   It was written by King David, like Psalm 23.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   And Psalm 139 demonstrates all of these,
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   especially the first two.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.080]   And I believe it leads us to another omni
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.600]   that perhaps is even more important.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.480]   And that word is omnibenevolent.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.440]   What it means is all good.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.720]   And if you wanna fall asleep for the rest of the sermon,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.240]   that's okay, 'cause what I'm gonna tell you today
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.520]   can be summed in three words.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.080]   God is good.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.920]   That's worth an amen, I think.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.440]   God is good.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.240]   Now Bible teachers will tell you
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.040]   that of all the 150 Psalms,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.200]   Psalm 139 is the one that best describes
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.280]   God's personal relationship with us.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.700]   The idea that God is not far off,
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.400]   but is near to each one of us.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.840]   As a kid, did you ever play hide and seek?
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.340]   Do you remember hide and seek?
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.920]   I can remember just a few years ago
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.400]   when my grandkids were very, very small.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.720]   I mean, hide and seek took a very different angle.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.440]   So when I went to hide,
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.820]   I had to hide very close so they could see me,
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.800]   because if they couldn't find me in a nanosecond,
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.740]   they would panic.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.840]   But when it was their turn to hide,
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.240]   as I turned around, I could already see them.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.740]   But you have to play a little game
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.760]   for about two or three minutes.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.060]   I can't see you.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.680]   I need to tell you today,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.000]   you cannot play hide and seek with God.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.640]   You see, the first thing that we learn from Psalm 139
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.140]   is that God sees everything about me.
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.380]   Let's start by reading the first four verses.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:02.440]   Lord, you have searched me and you know me.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.980]   You know when I sit and when I rise.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.600]   You perceive my thoughts from afar.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.240]   You discern my going out and my lying down.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.100]   You are familiar with all my ways.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.640]   Before a word is in my tongue,
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.740]   you know it completely, oh Lord.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.120]   Lord, you have searched me and you know me.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.400]   Now the word search literally means to examine,
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.280]   to examine with pain and care.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.220]   Jewish people used it to describe digging deep into a mine
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.760]   or exploring a land or investigating a legal case.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.200]   These verses describe God's omniscience,
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.140]   which as I said, means all knowing.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.460]   My friends, God knows everything.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.600]   Friends may see us from the outside,
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.160]   but God sees our hearts.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.840]   Hebrews 4:13 says,
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.600]   nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.900]   Everything is uncovered and laid bare to him
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.660]   to whom we must give an account.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.700]   I love general knowledge quizzes.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.820]   I'm a good person to have on your team,
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.740]   particularly if you want to answer questions on pop music
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.100]   from around 1965 to 1990.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.500]   Just a tip.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.860]   But I get so frustrated sometimes
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.500]   when I'm on a general knowledge quiz,
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.980]   I'm watching one on TV
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.220]   and I feel I should know the answer, but I don't.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.100]   I need to tell you,
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:08.340]   there is no question that God cannot answer.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.860]   No problem that confuses him.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.380]   He's never surprised.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.580]   He's never shocked.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.700]   He never says, oh really?
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:26.960]   These verses list three specific areas
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.500]   that concern you and me.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   First it says in verse three,
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.820]   you know when I sit down and when I rise,
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.780]   you discern my going out and my lying down.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.260]   You are familiar with all my ways.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.780]   In other words, God knows everything we do.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:53.560]   He knows when I plop into my armchair to watch Netflix.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.960]   And he knows when I get up to get some more nibbles
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.640]   and soda.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.160]   Okay, some more beer, sorry.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.300]   Now talking of which, he knows all our habits.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.960]   He knows our good habits and our bad habits,
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.200]   our weak areas and our strong ones.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.600]   He sees them all.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.340]   Actually, he knows them better than you do.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:24.160]   Also verse four says, before a word is on my tongue,
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.540]   you know it completely, oh Lord.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.320]   God knows every word we say.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.760]   He doesn't just know it after we say it.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.000]   He knows it before we say it.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.200]   Now, if you're like me, this is a problem
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.920]   because I often open my mouth
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.200]   without engaging my brain first.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.840]   Like I say things like England are gonna win the Euros.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.580]   And then I think, God, you already knew
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.060]   when I was gonna say that.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.480]   And you knew I was gonna regret it.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.460]   Couldn't you cut like that just to warn me in advance
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.220]   so that I could keep my mouth shut?
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.980]   The third thing that God knows in verse two,
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.560]   you perceive my thoughts from afar.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.040]   God knows everything we've ever thought about.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.480]   Oh, think about that for a moment.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.640]   Oh, God knows you just thought about that.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.400]   How can you grasp a God who knows every thought
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.720]   that you've ever had?
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.560]   Plus those of 7.7 billion people in the world.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.480]   It's hard to take in.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.900]   Now, if God sees and knows everything I do or even think,
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.160]   now, what does that mean to me?
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.680]   That means He has enormous power
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.020]   to encourage me in what's right.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:04.500]   He has enormous power to help me in temptation.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:11.280]   He knows exactly the struggle that is going on in my mind.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.560]   He sees it coming before I see it coming.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.080]   And He's already preparing an escape route
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.180]   so I can get away from temptation.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:25.020]   And because God sees me when I'm tempted,
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.700]   that's a motivation for me not to give in.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:36.040]   I don't want to sin when He's watching me.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.020]   You know, it's human nature.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.600]   If you know a police car sitting there, you don't speed.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.080]   Oh, it's so funny in Hong Kong.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.760]   I mean, you know where I live,
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.280]   we go off the Dingao Bridge
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.520]   and then we go onto like a four-way freeway,
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.280]   but the limit is 70 kilometres an hour
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.720]   on a four-lane freeway.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.040]   It's incredible.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.440]   And there's this orange box which tells you it's speeding.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.880]   I love watching the cars one by one,
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.600]   the brake lights going on.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.160]   It's amazing.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.280]   If you know your boss is watching,
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.840]   you don't play Fortnite on your computer at work.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   So when I'm tempted, God wants to help me out.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.720]   I'll tell you something, this coming week,
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.360]   I'm gonna face some temptation.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.960]   So are you.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.280]   I don't know when it will come.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.080]   I don't know what it will be, but God does.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.120]   God already knows about it
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.880]   and He's already prepared an escape route
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.720]   away out of temptation.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.760]   So that's number one, God sees everything about me.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.920]   The second thing we learn from this Psalm
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.280]   is that God is continually with me.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.040]   Verse five,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.160]   you hem me in,
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.200]   behind and before.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.400]   You've laid your hand upon me.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.560]   Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.280]   too lofty for me to attain.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.040]   Where can I go from your Spirit?
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.720]   Where can I flee from your presence?
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.200]   If I go up to the heavens, you're there.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.000]   If I make my bed in the depths, you're there.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.400]   If I rise on the wings of the dawn,
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.240]   if I settle on the far side of the sea,
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.640]   even there your hand will guide me,
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.960]   your right hand will hold me fast.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:47.000]   If I say, surely the darkness will hide me
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.360]   and the light will become night around me.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.160]   Even the darkness will not be dark to you.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.080]   The night will shine like the day
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.800]   for darkness is as light to you.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.040]   Now this phrase, hem me in,
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:07.400]   can be translated as to God, a valuable object.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.480]   You know, if you're on a jewelry show or something,
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.400]   to God that would be to hem it in.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   These verses describe God's omnipresence,
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.320]   which as I said, simply means all present.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.400]   It means that God is present everywhere
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.000]   in the universe at the same time.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.160]   Not a little bit of Him here, a little bit there.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.160]   No, He's fully present at every place all the time.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.000]   Now I know you can't understand that, nor can I,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.360]   but then again, we're not God.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.640]   I mean, to be honest, just as mentioned,
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.520]   I'm really looking forward to my extended vacation
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.640]   in the UK next month, COVID willing.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.240]   I'm going to see my elderly relatives.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.240]   I've got four elderly relatives between the ages of 86 and 91.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.120]   And in fact, my brother-in-law,
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.320]   will be celebrating his 92nd birthday while we're there.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.280]   Now, I just wanna say to you guys,
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.560]   don't bother contacting me.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.040]   I'm checked out.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.480]   WhatsApp groups, gone.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.760]   But think about it.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:30.400]   If God went on vacation, even for a moment,
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.520]   the universe would fall apart.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.760]   Now we don't have to worry about Him going on vacation
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.680]   because there's nowhere He could go
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.360]   because He's already there.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.720]   It's like me saying, I think I wanna go on vacation.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.400]   I think I wanna take Sandra special, somewhere special.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.920]   So I'm gonna take her to Hong Kong.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:00.240]   And then I realised I'm already here.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.800]   Come to think of it,
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.000]   that's the story of the past two years, isn't it really?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   But because God is a spirit, He can be everywhere at once.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.320]   He couldn't possibly get any closer to you
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.920]   because He's everywhere.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.200]   For centuries, people have asked, where's God?
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   It's a very important question.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.480]   Seekers want to know the answer
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.040]   because they want to find God,
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.120]   as if He's the one that's lost.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:45.080]   A person who is carrying around a lot of guilt
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   wants to know where God is so they can run the other way.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.440]   The hurting person, the lonely person wants to know
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.040]   because he or she feels abandoned by God.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   Where is God when I need Him?
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.520]   When I feel so alone
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.760]   and we see so much of this in the book of Psalms.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.600]   As King David discovered,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.080]   if I know that God is always with me,
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   then I can depend on Him no matter what trouble I'm facing.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.960]   No matter how bad things look,
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.160]   I know He's right here with me.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.160]   Psalm 34, 18 says,
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.160]   "The Lord is near to those who are discouraged."
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.280]   Some of you might need to hear that today.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.400]   He saves those who have lost all hope.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.720]   My friends, if you're discouraged, God is with you.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.200]   Is your heart breaking?
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.480]   God is near you.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.680]   Are you lonely?
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.560]   You are not alone.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.520]   God is with you.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.200]   Do you feel like you don't know which way to go?
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.780]   God is your direction indicator, your road sign.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.520]   In verse 10, He says this,
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.240]   "Your hand will guide me.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.840]   "Your right hand will hold me fast."
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.680]   If you realise that God is with you,
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.320]   you realise you have nothing to worry about.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.080]   He will guide you and He will hold you fast.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.360]   You can trust Him no matter what comes along.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:40.200]   The next section of Psalm 139
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.080]   is one of the best known parts of the Bible.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.040]   This is why I really love this Psalm.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.600]   We've seen, haven't we, that God sees everything about me.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.800]   We've seen that God is continually with me.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.640]   And in this section,
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.640]   we see that God planned out everything about me.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.840]   I love this.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.640]   Verse 13, "You created my inmost being.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.240]   "You knit me together in my mother's womb.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.720]   "I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.860]   "Your works are wonderful.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.640]   "I know that full well.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.960]   "My frame was not hidden from you
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.120]   "when I was made in the secret place,
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.960]   "when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.360]   "Your eyes saw my unformed body.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.200]   "All the days ordained for me were written in your book
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.880]   "before one of them came to be."
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.280]   You know, in 21st century,
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.280]   we put an incredible amount of importance on how we look.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.960]   If I look good, I must be good.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.480]   Wrong.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:07.640]   It's amazing what we do to make ourselves look good.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:13.320]   Slimming treatments, liposuction, facial scrubs.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.000]   There's half of us over here on sunbeds
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.280]   getting fake sun tans,
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.360]   and the other half over there having face whitening.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.480]   It's ridiculous.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:29.600]   Proverbs 31 says, "Charm can be deceptive
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.400]   "and beauty doesn't last."
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.920]   My friends, no matter how much Botox you use,
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.900]   beauty doesn't last.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.800]   1 Samuel 17 says, "Man looks at the outward appearance,
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.920]   "but God looks at the heart."
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   I need to tell you, God places no emphasis on how we look.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.600]   He says it doesn't matter
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.200]   because you can't judge a person by his appearance.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.160]   And here's the point, it's important.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.840]   You need to listen to this.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.200]   God created you exactly the way you are.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.960]   I think I might say that again, it's so important.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.480]   God created you exactly the way you are.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.400]   It was part of his perfect plan for you.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.240]   He wanted you to look just like you look.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.960]   He wanted you to have exactly the skills
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.560]   and abilities and talents you have.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.580]   That was his perfect design for you.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.920]   In verse 13, David said, "You created my inmost being.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.800]   "You knit me together in my mother's womb.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.480]   "I praise you because I'm fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.520]   "Your works are wonderful."
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.120]   Can I be honest?
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.800]   Not many of us are really that excited
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.200]   about the way God made us.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.420]   Many of us are so self-critical.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.000]   We're always putting ourselves down.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.740]   Oh, maybe you don't say it out loud,
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.720]   but you walk in here and you walk in here smiling.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.880]   Hi.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.800]   But inside you're thinking, I'm fat, I'm dumb,
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.440]   I'm ugly, I'm slow, I'm a bad person.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.060]   I'm a terrible Christian.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:32.960]   God wants you to stop putting yourself down.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:39.800]   God wants you to stop putting yourself down.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.880]   When you say these things,
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.460]   you're really pointing to the creator who made you.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.720]   When you say, God, I'm worthless, I'm no good,
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.200]   I can't do anything.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.560]   What you're really saying is,
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.200]   God, you blew it when you made me.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.080]   God says, no, I didn't.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.600]   God says, I created you just the way I wanted you,
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:12.080]   but you haven't figured out yet just how much I love you
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.700]   and what my purpose for you is.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.300]   My friends, you are a marvellous creation
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.420]   and you are designed exactly the way He wanted you.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:30.640]   Not only did God make you a wonderful creation,
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.080]   but He has a plan for your life.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.700]   The verses we read earlier said that,
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.860]   even in my mother's womb, you were preparing me.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.380]   You knit me together in my mother's womb.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:49.000]   All the days ordained for me were written in your book
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.960]   before one of them came to be.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:57.780]   God has a purpose for every person.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:04.720]   And that means that you are on a special assignment
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.560]   from God.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.620]   God's got some work to do in this world
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.180]   and it can only be done by you.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:18.180]   When you understand that, it makes all the difference.
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.300]   So God sees everything about me.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.220]   God is continually with me.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.900]   God has planned everything about me.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.880]   And let's go to the last section of the Psalm.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:35.460]   We see that God is continually leading me.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:41.420]   Verse 17, "How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.300]   How vast is the sum of them!
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.220]   Were I to count them,
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.100]   they would outnumber the grains of sand.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.420]   When I awake, I'm still with you.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.820]   If only you would slay the wicked, O God,
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.500]   away with me, you bloodthirsty man.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.280]   They speak of you with evil intent.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.600]   Your adversaries misuse your name.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.540]   Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord,
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.380]   and abhor those who rise up against you?
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.820]   I have nothing but hatred for them.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.420]   I count them my enemies.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:16.420]   Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:20.700]   Test me and know my anxious thoughts.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.660]   See if there is any offensive way in me
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.700]   and lead me in the way everlasting."
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.540]   It says here that God's thoughts about you
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.580]   outnumber the number of grains of sand.
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.900]   Do you know how many grains of sand there are?
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.700]   Well, you will now, 'cause I'm gonna tell you.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   7.5 times 10 to the power of 18 grains of sand
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:52.900]   or 7 quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.940]   That's a lot of sandcastles.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:26:01.020]   What that means is that God is thinking
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.220]   about you all the time.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.180]   But what is he thinking?
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:14.420]   One of the things he's thinking about is in verse 23.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.560]   Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.620]   Test me and know my anxious thoughts.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.260]   This sermon is called "Search Me."
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.420]   It says he is searching your heart.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.220]   He's searching your motives,
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.860]   your anxious thoughts or worries,
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.860]   and leading you in the right direction.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:43.240]   He's constantly thinking about me
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.480]   so he can constantly lead me
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.820]   so that I can follow him and be blessed.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:56.620]   You see, God's not like my headmaster at school on that day.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:03.060]   Every time I do the right thing, God's watching.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.300]   Every time instead of sinning, I choose not to sin.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.860]   Every time I resist the temptation,
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.540]   every time I stand up for the right thing,
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.580]   no matter how small or insignificant,
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.500]   God knows it and sees my faithfulness to him.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.180]   Matthew 6, Jesus says,
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.240]   "Be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.000]   To be seen by them.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.920]   Then your father who sees what is done in secret
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.320]   will reward you."
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.560]   Every good deed will be rewarded
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.320]   no matter how insignificant,
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.260]   regardless of whether anybody on earth even saw it.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:55.560]   Every word of encouragement you give to other people,
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.320]   every kind word or compliment,
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.480]   every time you do a thoughtful act,
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.320]   every time you encourage someone, a community group,
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.760]   every time you had the opportunity to gossip and didn't,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.400]   every time you had the opportunity to be critical
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.820]   and you weren't, God sees it all.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.280]   He's omniscient.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.720]   He's omnipresent.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.840]   He's omnipotent.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.880]   I'm glad they told me that at school.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   You see,
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:42.300]   it ultimately doesn't matter how I appear to any of you
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.780]   or what anyone else thinks about me.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:52.580]   This Psalm shows me the only thing that matters
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.340]   is what God thinks of me.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.200]   And I've already told you
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.740]   that he is omnibenevolent, all good.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.520]   So how I'm gonna finish
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:11.760]   is I'm gonna tell you exactly what God thinks about you.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.560]   I'm gonna read to you something
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.040]   that's called the Father's Love Letter.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.640]   Some of you may have seen it.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.560]   It's taken mainly from Psalm 139
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.760]   and elsewhere in scriptures.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.200]   And what I'm gonna ask you to do now
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.540]   is to close your eyes.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.340]   Just take all the distractions away,
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.040]   put your phone down for a moment.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:37.940]   This is God talking to you.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.280]   My child,
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.200]   notice before we start what he's called you.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.400]   My child, my son, my daughter.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.420]   You may not know me, but I know everything about you.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.480]   I know when you sit down and when you rise up,
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.580]   I am familiar with all your ways.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.480]   Even the very hairs on your head are numbered.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.920]   For you were made in my image.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.840]   In me you live and move and have your being,
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.260]   for you are my offspring.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.920]   I knew you even before you were conceived.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.840]   I chose you when I planned creation.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.200]   You are not a mistake,
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.080]   for all your days are written in my book.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.700]   I determined the exact time of your birth
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.960]   and where you would live.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.560]   You are fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.760]   I knit you together in your mother's womb
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.240]   and brought you forth on the day you were born.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.740]   Now I've been misrepresented by those who don't know me.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.880]   I'm not distant and angry,
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.760]   but I'm the complete expression of love.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.000]   And it's my desire to lavish my love on you,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   simply because you are my child and I am your father.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.240]   I offer you more than your earthly father ever could,
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.400]   for I am the perfect father.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.400]   Every good gift that you receive comes from my hand,
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   for I am your provider and I meet all your needs.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:21.040]   My plan for your future has always been filled with hope,
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.800]   because I love you with an everlasting love.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.440]   My thoughts towards you are as countless
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.960]   as the sand on the seashore.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.840]   And I rejoice over you with singing.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.080]   I will never stop doing good to you,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.480]   for you are my treasured possession.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.480]   I desire to establish you with all my heart and soul.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.460]   And I want to show you great and marvellous things.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:54.820]   If you will seek me with all your heart, you will find me.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:59.540]   Delight in me and I will give you the desires of your heart,
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:04.040]   for it is I who gave you those desires.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.520]   I'm able to do more for you than you could possibly imagine,
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.240]   for I am your greatest encourager.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.040]   I'm also the father who comforts you in all your troubles.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.360]   When you are brokenhearted, I'm close to you.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.120]   As a shepherd carries a lamb,
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.720]   I've carried you close to my heart.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.440]   One day I will wipe away every tear from your eyes
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.200]   and I'll take away all the pain
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.000]   you've suffered on this earth.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.960]   I am your father and I love you,
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.300]   even as I love my son, Jesus.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.940]   For in Jesus, my love for you is revealed.
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.460]   He is the exact representation of my being.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.660]   He came to demonstrate that I am for you
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.140]   and not against you.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.860]   And to tell you I'm not counting your sins.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.660]   Jesus died so that you and I could be reconciled.
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:02.060]   His death was the ultimate expression of my love for you.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:07.060]   I gave up everything I loved that I might gain your love.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.020]   If you receive the gift of my son, Jesus,
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:18.380]   you receive me and nothing will ever separate you
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.140]   from my love again.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.620]   Come home and I'll throw the biggest party
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.780]   heaven has ever seen.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:30.780]   I've always been father and will always be father.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:36.580]   My question is, will you be my child?
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.940]   I am waiting for you.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:46.260]   And it's signed, love your dad, almighty God.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.260]   Almighty God.
