[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   I am neither an extrovert or introvert, I'm kind of like a coffee-fert.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.880]   So before coffee, I'm like a cat, but she can do that whenever.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.080]   And the conferences, both conferences that you mentioned, sounds amazing.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.160]   I'd love to sign up.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.160]   Thank you.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.160]   Yes.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.760]   Right, so I, first of all, like in today's prayer meeting, we came up with this phrase
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.600]   that, oh, we're here as a family.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.340]   It was mentioned a few times in the prayer meeting before both services, and it was also
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.800]   mentioned when we led the Cantonese service as well.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.640]   And I remember, wow, family, that's a really good term to, you know, describe how we are
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.040]   all together.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.880]   And as a family, I just want to share something with you that is a little bit embarrassing.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.280]   Okay, I don't know if you've experienced this kind of embarrassment at home before, it's
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.720]   when you have to take out the trash.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.200]   Whenever you take out the trash, you don't wear your outfit, you just wear your pajamas,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200]   right?
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.880]   You wear pajamas, you put your, in a messy bun, and you don't fully wear your shoes.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.280]   You tiptoe in your shoes, and then you just take out your trash and you walk out of the
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.040]   door and then right as you do it, the door slams behind you.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.680]   And you're left with pajamas and a messy bun and two bags of trash.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.680]   And have any one of you been in that position?
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.920]   I haven't, I just want to say I haven't, but then there's a hand raised up.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.920]   I haven't, I always take my, you have too?
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.920]   Oh, that's beautiful.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.080]   I want to see you in a messy bun as well.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.440]   And it was kind of like an embarrassing moment with locked doors and I can't, and sometimes
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.760]   door just close when you're not expected to, right?
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.820]   But then there are moments when I close the door on my own.
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.040]   So I remember a few years ago, I was serving at K4C in Wan Chai.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.620]   So they have this annual party for K4C volunteers, and they send out the email, they invite everyone.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.560]   And at that time I was, you know, in a big church and I was a tiny person.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.880]   I go, Oh, I need to make some friends.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.200]   So I go in and I, I try to go to the party.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.120]   So after the service, I plucked up my courage.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.320]   I walked to the mini hall, I opened the door and it was so lively.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   Everyone was so friendly.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.000]   And so I closed the door behind me and I just left.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.480]   I couldn't, I couldn't go and go into a room where there are so many people.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.080]   The atmosphere is so warm.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.760]   I need people that are like quiet and not talk and let me just slip in without noticing.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.920]   And so I closed the door behind me.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.680]   And I feel like if I have to make, put a metaphor to describe what relationships are like, I
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.720]   would use the door.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   I would use the door.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.160]   You know, sometimes how you would close a relationship and just close the door.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   And sometimes you want to open a relationship.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.520]   But then have you ever put yourself in a situation where you're met with locked doors?
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.120]   Like you try to open it, but it's locked.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.920]   You try to talk to that family member, but it's not responding.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.840]   You feel like, Oh, I need to, I want to text that person, but go, Oh no, I shouldn't.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.220]   I haven't talked to that person for a long time.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.200]   And it's Christmas and everyone is gathering, but that person is not there anymore.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.240]   Or maybe it's a friend that there will be so many misunderstanding or conflict between
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240]   you two.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.920]   He just stopped reaching out.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.280]   Perhaps you've been betrayed or hurt by them.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.680]   And so you had to freeze that relationship and set it aside while you heal yourself.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.000]   And maybe the door is locked between you and your partner.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.900]   You might still eat with each other and you have conversation about daily necessities
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.760]   and things like that.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.920]   But you know that the relationship is locked and you rarely let each other understand your
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.960]   thoughts and feelings anymore.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   It's a, in a temporary state of suspension.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.960]   But some relationships aren't just locked.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.880]   It's kind of dead.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.200]   It's like a, when it's a locked situation, you can still find a key and you open it and
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.920]   you create that channel of communication again.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.000]   But when you're in a dead relationship, you can't really seem to move on in that relationship.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.240]   When a relationship dies, it's the trust between the two people is gone.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.000]   And you sat and you think about it and you go, what happened?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.840]   How did I get there?
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.200]   A minute ago, I was still talking to that person.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.040]   I was still having jokes and we were in each other's lives.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.680]   But then suddenly, suddenly, it seems like it happened so quickly that this relationship
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.320]   is gone.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.680]   And I've read some books to describe how relationship end up in that situation.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.600]   Maybe maybe it's because of fear.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.880]   There are lots of fear in relationships.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.360]   Fear of rejections.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.720]   Like you you were left unread with two blue takes and it was never got back to you.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.240]   Or maybe we fear the conflict that we might have.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.720]   Well, there are conflicts in all situations and in all relationships.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.640]   But the fear of conflict just made me wonder, I don't want to reach out to that person anymore.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.040]   I don't want to be with this person anymore.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.520]   And maybe we're fear of the emotional outburst that might come.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.680]   Can I handle when the other person have an emotional outburst?
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.400]   And what if I have big emotions that I couldn't handle?
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.960]   What if there are accusations between the both of us?
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.220]   And because of the fear of conflict, of accusations and everything, it worsened into isolation.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.280]   We might stop sending messages to each other and avoid attending events that we might both
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.280]   be in.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.680]   And we tell ourselves that if I don't see that person, if I don't reach out, it's okay.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.760]   You know, a service level piece will be there.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.880]   But this piece just stop us from communicating with each other.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.600]   And with this mixture of fear and isolation and suspicious, it becomes a vicious cycle
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.400]   where every little detail becomes a trigger point for you.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.040]   Like you see this person's phone face down and you go, is he lying to me again?
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.600]   Was she lying to me again?
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.540]   We see that that person is just chatting so happily with the other person.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.200]   And you think about why is she so cold to me?
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.800]   And all of that just became a vicious cycle.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:37.000]   And we store, or I store, all the wounds in my heart and let it ferment.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.880]   And it was not even about forgiveness anymore.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:47.480]   It's about how I process my feelings and my doubts and my hurt and how do I, you know,
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.160]   move forward.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:57.160]   When relationships end between one person, it never just stopped affecting that relationship.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.800]   Oftentimes it affects how I feel about myself or how I treat or how I see other parts of
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.880]   my relationship.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.720]   And things like this might happen.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.600]   You might hear yourself saying, if I can't even handle my relationship with my parents,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.120]   how can I cherish those around me?
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.720]   If even the closest people hurt me, it's hard to trust others again.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.240]   If relationships are this fragile, I better be more careful.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.920]   And all these things accumulated and it fermented.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.960]   And so I might have a problem with one of my friends, but then it turned out that myself,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:44.640]   my worth, and how I see myself with other people are actually getting fractures.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.840]   And so this affects not just how we see that specific failed relationship, it shapes how
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.480]   I approach all relationships.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:02.300]   I was listening and watching the Joseph series and it just came to me that I go, I'm not
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.040]   angry with anyone, but I am fearful.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.400]   I don't know how to move on with a particular relationship, not because I'm angry, but I'm
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.600]   so scared that I don't know how to react or respond to that person anymore.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:24.120]   And so after that series, I had a little retreat for myself and I walked in the wetland park
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:33.260]   and I began to think about, I asked God, actually, I asked God, why is relationship so difficult?
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:40.320]   My relationship with God is fine, but why is the relationship between me and other people
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.200]   so difficult?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.920]   And I seem to hear God telling me that he gave me an image of broken glasses and he
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:57.960]   said, when you use the broken glasses to look at the world, how can your world appear whole?
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:06.000]   If you see things out of a broken lens, how can your world be complete and in the right
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.480]   proportion?
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.720]   When your perspective is already broken and distorted, how can you see your own flaws
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.840]   and sin from the right proportion?
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:22.240]   And this is a powerful image, just as broken glasses distort everything we see, our past
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:28.720]   hurt and fears can distort how we view all our relationships.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.500]   We might see potential betrayals when there is none.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:39.860]   We might interpret neutral actions as hostile or expect the worst from people because that's
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.760]   what our broken lenses show us.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.440]   In this series, we are talking about resurrection hope.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.920]   Last week, we discussed the resurrection of the body and Pastor Chapman talked about how
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:00.160]   Jesus' resurrection means sin was defeated and death's power is no longer the final story.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.640]   And what Jesus can resurrect isn't just our bodies, but also our relationship.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:14.520]   This resurrected Jesus doesn't just leave the tomb, he enters into our locked rooms,
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.880]   resurrecting relationships we've sealed off with fear and failure.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.960]   And today we're looking at scriptures from John 20, the scene where Jesus appears to
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.680]   his disciples.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.900]   In verse 19 it says, "On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:39.920]   were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders."
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.080]   At this point, Jesus has already risen.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.480]   At this point, the woman has already gone to the tomb, saw the empty grave, ran back
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.300]   to tell Peter and John, and Peter and John ran to the tomb and they saw the empty tomb.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.520]   They know that Jesus has risen.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.680]   But what did they do?
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.880]   They ran back to the room and locked themselves in for fear of the Jewish leaders.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:10.840]   And I wonder if you can imagine what are some of the other emotions that might be in the
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:18.780]   disciples' heart or mind.
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.640]   Could anyone guess disappointment?
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.560]   What were they disappointed about?
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.520]   They were likely to be disappointed about themselves.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.240]   Some of, some, if you remember who has boldly said, "If I have to die with you, I will
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.080]   never disown you.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.840]   Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you."
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:45.800]   But that person denied Jesus three times before the crow, before the rooster crow, and probably
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:52.020]   also faced identity crisis as their own identity comes from following Jesus.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.180]   Most disciples have left everything behind.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.520]   They left their livelihood behind, they left their families behind to follow Jesus.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.060]   Being the follower of Jesus is their identity.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:09.340]   But they're scattered when Jesus went to the cross.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.900]   And now with Jesus risen, who are they anymore?
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.860]   Can they still call themselves the follower of Jesus?
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.580]   They might feel unworthy.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:27.300]   Many theologians pointed out that disciples probably felt unworthy of the good news of
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.740]   the resurrection because they had completely failed.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.580]   How could they face the risen Lord?
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.500]   The sense of shame made them prefer to hide.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:44.300]   Fear, guilt, and shame made them hide themselves.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:52.380]   Just like us, when we face with dead relationships, we have the same feelings as well.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:13:02.220]   And at that moment, as the disciples hide behind locked doors, verse 19 continues, "Jesus
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:08.660]   came and stood among them and said, 'Peace be with you.'"
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.600]   Jesus didn't wait outside.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.580]   He didn't demand the disciples to be brave and open the doors, "It's me, Jesus.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.300]   You need to step out of your comfort zone."
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:24.820]   He didn't say that, but he directly entered that closed space, entering their most vulnerable
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.960]   situation.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.660]   And what's more touching is that his first word wasn't accusations like, "Why did you
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.660]   run away?"
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.540]   Or questioning, "Where is your faith?"
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.000]   Or scold them to say, "Why are you so cowardly?"
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.300]   But instead, with deep acceptance, he said, "Peace be with you."
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.820]   And I connect with that so much.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.820]   There were times when I have to go to spiritual healing sessions and prayer sessions, and
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.620]   the images that I have is often myself.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.100]   I locked myself in a room with really heavy locks and doors.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.180]   And that wasn't the first time I had that experience.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:12.900]   Especially when I was young, whenever I feel frustrated or sad or angry, this is what I
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.900]   do.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:20.420]   I lock myself in the bathroom and I just scream, an inaudible scream that I wouldn't let anyone
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.380]   know how I'm feeling.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.660]   I wouldn't let people know that I'm frustrated or I'm sad.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.020]   They don't know anything on the outside, but I locked myself in the bathroom.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.380]   I cry, I scribble angrily.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:39.180]   I just let my emotion out, but I would not let other people in.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:47.460]   I wonder if Jesus was in that room with me at that time.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.700]   Jesus didn't force the disciples to open the doors.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:59.340]   He just directly entered in, saying that, "Peace be with you."
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.260]   This peace wasn't just a simple greeting.
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:09.780]   It was a direct response to the disciples' inner fear, a healing for their shame, a release
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.860]   from their confined space, and restoration of their broken spirit.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:22.860]   This shows us that when we close ourselves off in fear, God doesn't knock with condemnation,
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.540]   but enters a situation bringing peace.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:35.140]   He completely understands our weaknesses and why we need to lock ourselves in the door.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.260]   This teaches us one important lesson.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.020]   Resurrection.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.380]   Resurrection hope doesn't wait for us to fix ourselves first.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:51.260]   It begins the moment Jesus actively breaks through our walls of fear.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.180]   It doesn't wait for us to fix ourselves.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:59.940]   We don't have to do that, but it begins the moment that Jesus actively breaks in.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:06.540]   I need to recognize my situation, that in the face of death, I cannot do anything.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.980]   Why do I keep mentioning death in today's message?
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.820]   It's because if I feel like the door is just locked, I could still find the key to open
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.820]   in.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.540]   If I think that my relationship with that person is just sickness, I could start to
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.940]   heal that sickness.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:26.460]   Or if I think I am okay, I just feel a little off, I can help myself to feel better.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.940]   But actually, I need to recognize that there is something dying in me.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.900]   There's some death in me.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:38.620]   There's nothing I can do in the face of death.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:44.460]   And because of that, I cannot change myself.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:51.220]   Jesus appearing in the locked room today tells us that He understands why we are hiding in
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.640]   locked rooms.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.520]   He doesn't need us to be brave or outgoing to take the first step.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:05.740]   When we cannot change ourselves, He's willing to enter into our hearts to bring us peace.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.100]   And verse 20 continues.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.220]   After He said this, He showed them His hands and side.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.340]   The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:23.520]   I believe that when Jesus on His journey to the cross, He has many injuries on His body.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.300]   He was beaten and whipped by the soldiers.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.300]   He has a thorny crown on His head, dug deep inside His head.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.140]   There were many scars and wounds on His body.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.020]   His resurrection power could absolutely heal everything.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:44.200]   But He deliberately withheld the wounds on His hands and His side.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:51.420]   This wasn't just to prove that He was the crucified Jesus, not just to confirm to the
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.260]   disciples that everything really had happened, that He has resurrected.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.380]   But this is the reason, showing them the wound on His hands, tells them that this is the
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.360]   reason why He came.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.500]   He came not to condemn us, but He came to tell us that I died for your sin, for your
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.300]   shame and for your guilt.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.820]   I have come here to show you my wounds.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:20.100]   I've come here also to show you my pierced side, to tell you that there's resurrection
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.660]   in me as well.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.720]   That whatever death you have in your body, in your mind, that you cannot fix yourself,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.900]   I am here bringing the resurrection power to you.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:35.840]   But in me there is life, in me there is hope, in me there is peace.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.680]   When the disciples saw the scars, they were overjoyed.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:45.900]   This joy came from an amazing discovery, that those once pierced hands now show forgiveness
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:52.440]   and acceptance, that those spear-pierced sides now spoke of resurrection power.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:19:00.280]   Those scars were no longer marks of death, but had become the sign of victory.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.960]   These disciples had abandoned Jesus when He needed them most.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:10.720]   Peter denied Him three times, but now the risen Lord appeared to them with these scars,
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.760]   offering not condemnation, but peace.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.960]   And today, when we think of relationships we have locked away, or that have died, we
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:26.120]   don't need to live in endless self-condemnation, constantly beating ourselves up for not taking
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.600]   more steps, or feel guilty that, "Oh, the Bible tells us that I must forgive and I could
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   not do that."
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.320]   No, we cannot do that.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.080]   No, there are things that we can't do it on our own, but we need to accept that Jesus
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:46.560]   is now in our lives, bringing peace, bringing resurrection.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:52.400]   What you cannot do becomes possible through Jesus' resurrection power.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:58.560]   And when we truly understand this, we discover that restoring relationship doesn't start
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:06.280]   with what we can do, but with accepting what Jesus has already done for us.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.540]   Restoring resolution doesn't start with, "I need to do now, I need to pray harder, I need
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.440]   to read the Bible more, I need to stop texting that person."
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.840]   No, actually, we need to accept that Jesus has brought healing in myself.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:26.760]   Jesus is going to fix or mend or heal something that was once broken in myself.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.700]   Broken relationship is not just about the relationship, it's about breaking something
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.320]   in your spirit as well.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:39.400]   Whenever you meet with another person, that interaction did a little something in your
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:45.240]   life, and when the relationship is broken, you feel it in yourself.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.560]   And so the healing doesn't just begin at the relationship, it begins in you.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:57.840]   And by accepting what Jesus has done for you, restoration begins.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:03.200]   It doesn't mean that our transgression doesn't matter or broken relationship doesn't need
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:09.600]   to be fixed, but rather we are filled with God's love and acceptance.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.840]   When Jesus accepts sinful and limited me, I can finally remove the broken glasses and
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.680]   see myself clearly.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:23.560]   We no longer rely on our strength to repair, but on the Lord who experienced the deepest
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.200]   brokenness and yet still choose to love.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:34.680]   His resurrection power does not only heal and wipe our tears, but as we embrace the
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:41.320]   tears, as we embrace our little kids, that we are able to find that our life has been
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:47.080]   repaired and we can extend that to other people.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:54.560]   When I was a teacher a few years ago, I was not a naggy person, but I became one because
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.520]   you know when all the clothes are on the floor and people say, "Oh, there's a funny story
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.120]   about clothes on the floor."
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.280]   So you know how lunchtime we need to bring curry?
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.760]   They have lunch, and there's one lunch they are having curry.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.520]   And so this little kid, they brought the curry and they're so happy, "I'm having curry beef
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.520]   today."
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.720]   They walked over to the school bag and tripped and fell into the school bag.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.040]   Well I haven't been a teacher and I understand that kids need to grow up and they need to
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.520]   start hanging their clothes.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   But I also learned that I can never nag a person to change.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.920]   There's no amount of nagging that I can go and go, "You need to fix this.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.920]   You need to improve.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.280]   You need to do this and that."
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.740]   They can't do that.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:40.220]   But what makes them change is that they feel that they're deeply loved.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:45.880]   When the kids feel that they're so loved, they know that they're able to fail, but are
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880]   still loved.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:52.600]   When they're so loved, they know that I'm able to change, not because of the nagging,
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.640]   but because I'm loved and I want to show up for the person who loves me.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:03.400]   When I'm so loved, I know that even if I fail, even if I have my limits, I am still loved.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.840]   The love for me isn't depending on how well I do, but depend on that person who loves
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.560]   me regardless.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.180]   And this is what Jesus is doing for the disciples in that locked room.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.720]   He isn't telling them, "Oh, you're not following me good enough.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   You abandoned me.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.320]   Now I don't love you anymore."
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:26.200]   No, He entered into the room telling them of His full acceptance and His full love for
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:32.220]   the disciples so that they can have the healing and courage to follow again.
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:38.600]   And today in our situation, maybe we feel like we have fallen short and we don't know
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.180]   how to pick ourselves up again.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:49.940]   And today Jesus wants to show up in your room and tell you that, "I know that's why I come.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.940]   I know we will fail.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.780]   I know we have sins and limitations.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.820]   That's why I come.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:04.240]   Accept what I've done for you and let me love you so much that you know you can fail, but
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:12.180]   you can pick yourself back up again because I love you regardless."
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.200]   As mentioned earlier, the healing of our hearts in relationship isn't something we can achieve
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.340]   on our own, only in Jesus' resurrection power.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:28.820]   And so in verse 22 to 23 it says, "And with that, Jesus breathed on them and said, 'Receive
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.880]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.800]   If you forgive someone's sin, their sins are forgiven.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.020]   If you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.'"
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.960]   If you've read Acts 2, you might wonder, is it too early in the story?
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:48.480]   Weren't they supposed to wait for, you know, everyone wait in the room and the whole Holy
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.820]   Spirit came onto them and this whole spirit filling up in the upper room story?
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:59.080]   But theologians point out that this was the preparatory giving, preparing them for what
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:06.880]   was going to come, especially for the mission of relationship, restoration, and forgiveness.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:14.200]   As described in Ezekiel chapter 37, 9 to 10, God's spirit blows on dry bones, connecting
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:21.320]   those dry, broken, scattered bones, rebuilding to rebuild broken fellowship.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.520]   It is not just an individual thing.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:31.160]   When the Holy Spirit come and give you life in yourself, it's not just individual, but
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:38.720]   actually in community, bringing you life, giving you fresh life through the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.320]   And Jesus continues, "If you forgive anyone's sin, their sins are forgiven."
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:52.860]   This isn't calling the disciples to be judges, but channels of forgiveness, channels of forgiveness.
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:59.800]   That means if you have experienced Jesus' forgiveness, then you're able to forgive others.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:05.640]   So in the K4C room, the purpose is not to teach good kids.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:12.240]   The purpose of the kids ministry is not to tell them to follow rules, but actually tell
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.800]   them about God's love, tell them about God's forgiveness.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:21.000]   They experience it so that they're able to channel it to the people around them.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.400]   K4C isn't a space for them to learn to good behavior.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.080]   It is a space for them to connect to God.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.740]   And so are we here.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.340]   This is just a bigger K4C room, right?
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:38.120]   This is just us learning to be kids before God, learning how to receive this unconditional
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:43.780]   love, learning to receive forgiveness so that we can do what we've experienced.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.860]   If you've never received forgiveness before, how do you know the weight that's been lifted
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.240]   off your shoulders?
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.680]   If you haven't understood how you have been, you know, how you've been understood your
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.360]   limits and your sin, how can you do that to other people?
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:05.180]   I still encourage you to try to think about it, but come to church and worship and sermon
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.700]   and fellowship.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:12.720]   Let us learn to receive the love and the forgiveness and this acceptance so that when we go out
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:18.740]   of the room, that room, that world that you're in becomes the bigger K4C room that we're
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:24.660]   able to channel that forgiveness and that love to other people.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.820]   And today I would like to encourage you to take practical steps towards this resurrection
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.640]   in our relationship.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:38.140]   Just as Jesus entered that locked room gradually, first bringing peace, then showing his scars
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:44.200]   and then breathing his spirit, we too can take gradual steps.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:53.820]   And that is not a list of things to do list, but I want you to this week, go to a room
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:28:01.000]   and just think about and work with God, work with Jesus to show you the locked rooms that
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.100]   you're in.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:09.380]   Maybe that relationship has locked you into a space where you felt shame and hurt.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:15.200]   Maybe that relationship has locked you in a room where you condemn yourself of unforgiveness
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.220]   or other burdens.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:24.980]   Talk to God, spend time with God to show you what locked relationship you might be in and
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:32.980]   then feel his presence in that relationship or in that hurt.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:39.300]   You don't have to force yourself to do anything other than being aware that Jesus is with
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.740]   you in that room.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.500]   He is with you.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:49.820]   He is with you to bring you peace, to bring you healing.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:57.140]   So before you go texting that person, before you go and ask that person out for a coffee,
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.180]   spend time with Jesus.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.660]   Let him show you his scars.
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:12.060]   Let him show you his wounds on his side to let you experience that acceptance and the
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.740]   love that he has for you.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:21.380]   And certainly when you're ready, take small acts of faith guided by the Holy Spirit for
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.380]   some relationship.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:27.460]   It could be a simple message that I've been thinking of you or for others, it might be
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:33.340]   writing a longer letter or ask them to go out for a coffee.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.420]   However, I do need to add this important note.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.580]   For relationships that has been toxic or dangerous, your resurrection step could look a little
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.740]   different.
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:48.180]   It might mean just praying for that person from a distance or working on forgiveness
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:55.500]   without reconciliation or seeking counseling process to process your feelings.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:05.860]   Setting healthy boundaries can be just as much of an act of resurrection as reconciliation.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.180]   Remember that resurrection is an instant.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:14.980]   Even Jesus' disciples took time to understand what is happening and you don't have to force
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.220]   yourself to respond immediately.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:25.820]   But I do want to make space for us today to think about what God has been opening up in
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.020]   your heart and mind as well.
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.940]   So can I invite the worship team to come up.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:36.980]   As I was preparing for this topic, the sermon, I do have a person in mind.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:44.100]   A few years ago when I was in Australia, I would often talk to this person and every
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.380]   time I talked to that person, I would cry.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.900]   The conversation is okay, it's nothing.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:58.740]   But when I put my phone down, a wave of condemnation or manipulation just hit me and I couldn't
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.820]   enjoy the relationship I have with that person.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.020]   And so in one of the worship session at church, I cry out to God.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.380]   I worship and I go, "How can I fix this?
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.380]   What can I do?
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.300]   Is it something that's wrong in me that I'm not loving enough?"
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:23.740]   And that in that moment, I saw this person lying lifeless in front of me.
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.340]   Lifeless.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:31.660]   And I picked that person up and I put it on the altar.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.900]   And I go, "This person is dead.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.900]   There's no life."
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.700]   But I surrender this person to God.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:45.340]   Only Jesus, you have the power to resurrect.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.340]   Only you can do what I cannot do.
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:59.660]   So I put this person on the altar and I believe that you will do this for me.
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.700]   And so I'd like you to pray.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.100]   Close your eyes.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:17.300]   I pray for those that are going through difficult relationships right now.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:35.380]   That in your confined spaces, that you feel the presence of Jesus with you.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:49.140]   That you will feel Him showing you His wounds on His hands and side.
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:57.580]   I pray for those that has a lot of self-condemnation.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.340]   For those that are beating themselves up.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:12.060]   That I pray for you to experience God, experiencing Jesus with you in that moment.
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:26.300]   That when He is not condemning you, why are you doing that to yourself?
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:37.020]   I pray for the breath of the Holy Spirit to come onto this room right now.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:42.220]   Minister to us, Holy Spirit.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:52.180]   That we recognize that there are things dying and there's nothing we can do about it.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:34:00.900]   And we need you, Holy Spirit.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:10.900]   I pray that everyone is able to step into next week knowing that you are fully known
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.620]   and deeply loved.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:23.860]   I pray that as you finish the service today, stepping into your home, your office, your
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:33.060]   family, your workplace, that you feel this protection around you.
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:36.860]   Our message is not a message of fixing something.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:52.140]   It is about accepting, accepting our Jesus, dying for us, giving us life and loving us.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:35:09.260]   So I give you a time to pray, to pray for yourself, to talk to Jesus.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.340]   Thank you, Holy Spirit.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.340]   Thank you, Holy Spirit.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:36.020]   We receive you, Holy Spirit.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:44.500]   Thank you, Lord, for your protection, your love and your understanding.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.740]   Thank you that you're with us.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.180]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
