[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Well, one of the things that is central to us as a church is the work of justice,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   and particularly the idea of biblical justice.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.560]   The fact that the gospel is not just about us having a relationship that's reconciled with God
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.360]   and enabling us to have an eternal relationship with Him.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.360]   That actually the gospel is more than that.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.480]   The gospel is also about our relationship with one another.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.920]   It's about how we live out our relationship with God in the world right here, right now.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.680]   When Jesus told the disciples to pray, He said, "Pray that heaven would come to earth right here and now."
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.920]   And the work of biblical justice is to see something of God's culture,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   His heart, and His spirit at work in the brokenness of our society
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.360]   and some of the systemic issues we see around us.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.480]   And so at The Vine, we've been very passionate about justice for many years.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.120]   But one of the things that you often ask us is, "Well, how do I get involved with the justice initiatives?
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.720]   How do I become more justice-centric in my own life?"
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.120]   Well, our justice and missions department have been working hard to think about ways
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.440]   in which we can be more practical in our outward work of justice.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.320]   And to tell you a little bit more about that, let's check out this video.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.360]   Hey Church, when we look throughout the history of the Christian faith,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.880]   one of the driving forces behind God's interactions with humanity
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.240]   centers on a desire to create a just and redeemed world.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.360]   In the moments where we see God respond to the cries of people living under injustice,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.560]   it's nearly always done by using people like us.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.760]   Our creator calls us into a partnership that leads to a change in our society.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.200]   Yet even with knowing that God is working through us,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.240]   why do we still find it so difficult to know how and where we're meant to stand up to injustice?
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.760]   Over the last year, our team have been asking this question,
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.480]   trying to understand what are the hurdles that prevent us from caring for those who are in need?
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.040]   And how can we support you better in that journey?
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.600]   And one of the ways that we did this was by releasing our colleague Estella
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.400]   into the wild on a Sunday at the Vine to hear from you the challenges that you're facing.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:11.680]   Hi, this is Estella at your service.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.920]   Today I'm going to interview some of our church members about what are some of the
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000]   things that stop them being involved in justice activities in our city.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.360]   My name is Nina.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.720]   Hi Nina, so what are some of the things that stop you being involved in justice activities in our city?
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.240]   Well, to be honest, I don't really know all that much about what the Bible says in regards to this.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.600]   My name is Gemma.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.360]   Hi Gemma, what are some of the things that stop you being involved in justice activities in our city?
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.720]   I don't know where to get the opportunities and how to get involved.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.000]   My name is Sidney.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.600]   Hi Sid, what are some of the things that stop you being involved in justice activities in our city?
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.640]   Well, it can be discouraging and I don't want to go about it alone.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.200]   Building on the insights from over 50 different conversations across our Vine community,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.640]   we're excited to launch a new justice initiative for the Vine that is designed to help you navigate
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.440]   these hurdles and find ways to pursue justice as a lifestyle. We want to invite you to join us.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.040]   On 27th of November, we are launching X-Gatherings, a bimonthly space for people to learn about the
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   practice of just living, find your actions and share stories of change. If you want to find
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.800]   buddies in the journey aligning to God's desire for justice, check out this QR code and get plugged.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:39.040]   The next way is to follow our new IG, Odd Tears, @elope. Odd Tears is about the unique tears and
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.680]   emotions that we share for the injustices that primes our actions. There will be posts on physical
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.800]   justice, practical tips and people stories. Subscribe our IG account today. To find out more,
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.560]   come visit us at the Justice and Mission booth in the foyer, get your limited edition tattoo
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.600]   and connect with us on IG or email. We are excited to see how God moves in your lives.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:14.480]   Yes, we're giving away limited edition tattoos today, okay? Yeah, it's a thing, it really is.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.640]   It's a thing. Don't worry, it's not permanent, okay? So if you would like to get your limited
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.120]   edition tattoo, but more importantly, connect with our justice team right outside and also follow
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.680]   Odd Tears. I think that's a really profound thing to think about is that Christ calls us to have our
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.480]   hearts broken for those in our city that we want to serve. That's what Odd Tears is all about. You
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.200]   can find out more about that straight after the service right outside with our Missions and Justice
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.760]   team. But now we have Carla with us. Can we put our hands together for Carla as she comes?
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:54.320]   Andrew, there's just one thing. Dim sum. Dim sum. Can I just clarify? Oh, did I get it wrong again?
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.080]   We're not paying for your dim sum. It's happening. You can go and have dim sum,
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.680]   but you got to cover it yourself. Okay, it's true. Carla and I are not paying for dim sum.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.560]   Ellison is, but we're not, okay? So there you go. But we'd love everyone to join.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.560]   Okay, whatever. Now, we're going to pray. We're continuing our series in Remedy of Relationships,
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.880]   and today we're looking at the idea of reconciliation. I want to pray for us and
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.000]   Carla as we come to this. Lord, we're so grateful for your presence with us, and we're grateful as
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.960]   we open the word that we never do so just ourselves. We do so through your Spirit.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.360]   And Lord, I know that Carla has poured hours into thinking, reflecting, praying on this passage that
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.320]   she's going to be bringing forth to us today. Lord, we now come to it with humility. We come
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.160]   to it with openness, and we come to it asking that you would speak to us, not just out of your word,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.600]   but out of who you are, Lord. And would you do this for your glory? We pray for Carla as she
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.320]   preaches, that you just fill her with your Spirit. Lord, give her courage in her words,
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.320]   and grace, Lord, as she speaks to us. We thank you for this in Jesus' name. Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:13.200]   - So one day over coffee with a friend, I've known for a very long time,
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.400]   you know, our kids are the same age. You know, we've hung out in Hong Kong over the years,
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:27.280]   Christian values, very similar interests. And we started talking about politics. Politics
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:35.920]   in a particular Western country that shall not be named, that was really facing some challenges
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.480]   in the leadership and the changes that were happening in that country. And as I listened
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:51.520]   to my friend talk, I began to get more and more uncomfortable as I realized that we had very
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:01.440]   different opinions and polarized political views. So of course, I artfully changed the topic,
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.560]   brought us onto safer ground, and ended our time together on a much lighter note.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:18.960]   But over the months, I noticed a change in how I was interacting with them. I would receive
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:27.120]   some posts from them, social media that I was following, and I started to find emotions rising
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:35.520]   within me, emotions of anger, frustration, getting cross about the things that they were posting,
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:43.360]   to the extent I stopped following them. Now, that didn't sit comfortable with me.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:51.200]   As I thought about it, I thought, "Wow, what kind of friend am I? Did I ghost someone?"
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.800]   Just because we have some different views, really? And as I began to think about why I
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:10.000]   have been responding in that way, I realized that actually it was because I was tired.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.960]   I was tired of being in disagreement with people. And the easiest thing to do is to pull back.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:28.080]   I just didn't have the energy. I wonder how many of us just don't have the energy at times.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:38.240]   But I felt sad at the loss of a friendship, a lot of shame, what type of friend was I?
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:46.720]   And I knew that as I reflected on it, this is not how Jesus would be. So after thinking and
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.320]   reflecting, and over these last few months, I've been on this journey of really discovering what
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:59.760]   it means to live at peace with those around me, despite differences, and to take steps of
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:08.000]   reconciliation where necessary and if possible. So when Ellison, thank you, Ellison, invited me
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.920]   to share on this theme of reconciled relationships a number of months ago, I had to smile.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:23.040]   As Christians professing to be followers of Jesus, I am saddened at how we often treat each other,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:29.840]   especially over the past few years. There have always been differences within the global church,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   and we see that through the diversity of traditions and beliefs under that banner of
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:44.400]   Christianity. However, rather than celebrate the beauty of our diversity, we often find ourselves
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:51.440]   at war with one another in our words and in our actions. In the milder form, we withdraw,
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:58.640]   disengage, find ourselves drawn to church communities that are very similar
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:06.560]   beliefs and comfortable places to be. And then the other extreme where we criticize,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:14.160]   take judgmental positions on other churches or leaders and people that we disagree with
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:21.520]   or maybe that are just different to us. We all do it or have done it in some way or the other.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:29.600]   And since we've heard over the past few weeks how we approach our relationships is an important
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.200]   call to us as Christians. So we have to take that honest look at ourselves and see
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:41.360]   how are we really with others, dare to believe we can live differently.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.040]   And as Ellison shared right at the start of this series, if we don't,
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:56.400]   divisions settle in, walls are built between people, and before we know it, we become more
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:05.680]   and more isolated. And this is not how Jesus calls us to live. So how do we be restorers of
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:13.600]   relationship? How can we be at peace with one another when we are and do have differences or
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:22.400]   when we are in disagreement? So we'll look at two passages today demonstrating to us how Jesus
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.800]   challenged the status quo to be in relationship with those who many disagreed with or were
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:38.880]   different to them. And Jesus is our role model for how we can be reconcilers. And Jesus in many ways
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:45.680]   gives us the permission to be counter-cultural, to break with societal, even religious norms
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:53.440]   when it comes to relationship with others and to have the courage to step towards people
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:02.560]   rather than to step back. So the two stories are found in the Gospel of Matthew. They're also
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:08.480]   referred to in Luke and Mark, and they take place immediately after Jesus has finished
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:15.680]   his teaching on how to live in the kingdom of heaven. We know that as the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:23.120]   So the context is important because what we witness is Jesus not just teaching on how to live,
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:29.360]   but then modeling what it means to practically embrace kingdom living,
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:37.200]   which as he is about to demonstrate was not the way religious leaders, teachers of the law,
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:46.800]   society at that time expected people to live. In Matthew, we learn that Jesus heads back down the
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.880]   mountain after teaching the crowds of people and encounters a leper who immediately kneels
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:13:00.640]   at the feet of Jesus and asks him to heal him. And Matthew chapter 8 tells us Jesus' response.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:08.800]   Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said, "be clean."
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:16.480]   Immediately he was cured of his leprosy. And then Jesus said to him, "See that you don't tell anyone,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:23.520]   but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded as a testimony to them."
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:31.520]   Leprosy is referred throughout the Bible was a broad term used to describe a range of skin diseases,
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:38.800]   which according to Levitical law meant that a person with any form of skin blemish or impurity
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:45.040]   was considered unclean and was to live separately from others. If you want some light reading,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:54.880]   just go to Leviticus chapter 13 and 14. Fascinating stuff. Tells you all about how
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:01.920]   leprosy was to be treated, why there were those laws there, and also how to follow
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:12.000]   the purification steps to join community once again. So if anyone had any contact with someone
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.520]   with leprosy, they too became unclean, would be required to follow all the requirements of
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:26.480]   Mosaic legislation as well. So you can imagine by the time of Jesus, lepers were really outcasts.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.520]   They had to remain at a certain distance from people. They were not allowed to live with their
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:37.040]   families. They were not allowed to work. They were kept away from participating in any religious
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:46.960]   festivals or celebrations. So not only did they face physical suffering, they also were discriminated
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:54.080]   against on every level. So this leper in this story does something extraordinary. Having heard about
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:01.040]   this man who was going around teaching and healing people, what does he do? He does the opposite of
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:14.160]   what is culturally acceptable, and he reaches out towards Jesus. Jesus, Jewish Jesus, grew up
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:24.400]   on the law of Moses. And he had just finished explicitly teaching and stating to the crowds
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:32.160]   of people around him that he had come not to abolish the law, but to fulfill the law.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:41.600]   And this Jesus, he reaches out to touch the leper, and then he speaks out healing.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:49.680]   Jesus's physical response appears at odds with how he should be acting. Why didn't he just speak
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:56.240]   out the healing? Why did he have to touch him? He could have just stood back, said a word, and he
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:03.600]   would have been healed. And then he didn't expose himself to becoming unclean according to the law.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:09.520]   Well, the Gospel of Mark gives us an important detail to this story because
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:18.880]   he says that Jesus was moved with compassion. Jesus crosses the divides of society
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:31.200]   and love took precedence over law. What about us? Does love, compassion, kindness, grace
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:41.520]   take precedence of how we respond to others? And then Jesus instructs the man to present himself
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:47.680]   to the priest and make the required offering that was necessary for his community to accept him back,
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.600]   enabling him to be reconciled back in relationship with others.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:02.080]   Jesus was a teacher of the law, but he lived out the true intention of the law,
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:11.360]   which was about reconciling us to a holy God and to each other. Love for God, love for others,
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:21.440]   possible only because of Jesus. So following this story, Jesus then encounters an enemy.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:29.600]   He's approached by those that represent the oppressive Roman Empire. Military officer in
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:36.400]   charge of a hundred Roman soldiers pleads for Jesus to heal his servant. Now we hear that
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:42.800]   this centurion is well-respected. He's a good guy. The Jewish leaders, they like him. He's known for
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:51.200]   being unusually generous towards them, but Jesus is under no obligation to help him, even more so
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:18:02.080]   because he's a Gentile. So what does Jesus do? Matthew tells us, "Jesus said to him, 'I will go
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:10.320]   and heal him.'" Now you can imagine the gasps around him as once again, Jesus is turning things
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:17.920]   upside down. Jewish law clearly separated Jews from Gentiles. It would have been scandalous
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:25.520]   for Jews to enter the home of a non-Jew. The centurion knows this as well, and this is his
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:32.720]   response. "The centurion replied, 'Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof,
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.960]   but just say the word. My servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority with soldiers
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:45.520]   under me. I tell this one go, and he goes. That one come, and he comes. I say to my servant,
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:51.120]   'Do this,' and he does it." When Jesus heard this, he was astonished, and he said to those
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.880]   following him, "I tell you the truth. I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:03.280]   I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, will take their places at the feast
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.440]   with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom will be
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:16.080]   thrown outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Then Jesus said
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:25.200]   to the centurion, "Go. It will be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:33.360]   that very hour. Jesus once again was modelling to those around him that in the kingdom of heaven,
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:41.600]   we are to love those considered as enemies. He takes a very practical response to that here.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:49.840]   Jesus is publicly showing he's willing to cross the invisible boundaries of unacceptable behaviour.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:58.560]   The centurion also crosses that boundary in his own request with humility and respect. He's a man
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:05.520]   with his own power and authority, yet he acknowledges there's a higher power and authority
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:13.280]   in Jesus. Jesus goes one step further in his public acceptance of the Turian. He says
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:23.440]   he was astonished. Other translations use amazed. He makes the example of this centurion to everyone
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:31.680]   around him, commending this foreign soldier for his insight and his faith. There's only one other
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:37.440]   time that Jesus is referred to as being astonished or amazed. That's in the book of Mark. Jesus was
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:48.880]   in his hometown with his own people facing a lot of opposition. There he was amazed or astonished
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:56.880]   at their lack of faith. Quite a contrast to those around him. You see religious leaders,
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.120]   teachers of the law, many Jews believe that Judaism was an inherited passport for entrance
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:11.440]   into the kingdom of heaven. Jesus challenges this in that bold statement, "I tell you the truth. I
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:21.520]   have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith." Then he goes on to reference the messianic
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:28.160]   feast where he paints a very clear picture. The shallow keeping of laws to gain merit with God
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:37.440]   at the expense of others is not what gets you into the kingdom of heaven. You see both the
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:45.040]   leper and the centurion, they demonstrate a courage to go against the status quo and take a risk
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   socially and personally by reaching out to Jesus. They were drawn to Jesus and Jesus was drawn to
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.520]   them. Throughout scripture, Jesus demonstrates through his teaching, his parables, his words,
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:10.080]   his actions, Jews, Gentiles, all people, all humanity share an involvement with him. Divisions
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:19.120]   because of race, gender, social status or beliefs have no part in the gospel when we choose to live
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:31.120]   like Jesus and we choose to love like Jesus. So who are the unclean, outcast or the enemies
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:41.440]   in our context? Are people drawn to us or do they stay away? Are we reaching out and building
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:50.480]   bridges intent on reconciliation? Have we given up on reconciliation or are we withdrawing,
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:23:02.240]   building those invisible walls, comfortable to be only with those that look or act just like us?
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:09.680]   I spent some time living and working in the Middle East and during my time there, I have to be honest
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:16.080]   with you, I built a lot of walls. I lived in a place where I was surrounded by a lot of
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:24.640]   discrimination and at times hostility. Often as a way of protecting ourselves, we do retreat behind
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:31.520]   those invisible walls where we feel safe and less vulnerable. And I do want to say that I'm not
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:38.960]   talking today about abusive relationships or when we find ourselves physically or emotionally at
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:48.720]   risk. In those cases, the priority is always safety. But here I was working in an environment
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:56.320]   where to be a woman was to be inferior. I would have male colleagues who would not look me in the
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:07.360]   eye, not speak to me. In fact, when I entered the room, they left. I couldn't open a bank account
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:15.440]   on my own. I needed permission to leave the country from my husband, which he obviously was
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:28.880]   going to give. Generally treated as a lesser human being because of my gender. I'm a pastor.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.360]   I've served here at this church for 10 years. But you know, if I'm truly honest with you,
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.600]   I'll let you into a little bit of a secret, but don't tell anyone if you're watching online,
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.920]   don't spread it. There's a little bit of insecurity in me of being a pastor.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:54.560]   And I see that when I withdraw from any large gatherings where there are other pastors.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:03.920]   Do you want to know why? Because I know that some of my brothers and sisters in Christ
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:14.320]   do not agree that women should be pastors. So I've built up a wall between other Christians
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:24.880]   with different theological beliefs. So what does it look like when we build walls or when we place
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:32.560]   barriers in front of those that are different to us? Let me demonstrate.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:47.280]   Now, if you're watching online and if you're in the room, it's dark. And if you're watching
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:54.800]   online, you may want to close your eyes, except if it's not safe. The point of this is to show
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:05.280]   you that when we build up walls, it's really hard to see our neighbors. Walls create a barrier
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:16.160]   between us. We don't see clearly. So if I have a different political view or theological position
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:27.040]   to you, if I have a different sexual orientation or see gender identity differently,
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:37.280]   or if I choose not to be vaccinated, how do you see me? How are you responding to me?
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:45.680]   Because what we do is when there is a wall in front of us, we begin to create our own story
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:54.560]   about that person. And that person, our story that we've created is often full of judgment,
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:04.480]   criticism, and our own assumptions. And we cannot be in relationship with those that are different.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:12.880]   We cannot reconcile with those that we are indifferent with different opinions if we do
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:21.600]   not see each other and break down those walls. The lights just came on if you're watching online.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:34.400]   Why can't we? Because you've created your own story about me, right? You've chosen the easier option
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:41.920]   because we always think that we are right. You withdraw from really getting to know me
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:50.240]   I in turn retreat because I don't feel safe. And I put up a wall, you put up a wall.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:58.160]   This becomes even more challenging if we're in family, more challenging if we're in a church
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:12.080]   community. So what walls have you built? What walls do we have as a Vine Church?
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:19.760]   What's hindering us from truly embracing each other and living in authentic relationships with
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:26.720]   each other? Is it fear of rejection, of being vulnerable, of being judged, lack of energy,
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:36.560]   even apathy? How do we break down those walls and how do we live with differences without
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:45.600]   compromising what we believe? We can agree to disagree, you know. How can we be truly
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:51.360]   reconcilers in relationships and live as Jesus lived? You know, it isn't easy.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:29:00.640]   And I don't want to oversimplify how hard it is to be in relationship with those that are different,
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:08.160]   to move towards reconciliation when you've been hurt. It isn't easy, but it is possible.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:15.920]   And I want to give us three ways that we can move towards being a people known
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.720]   for our love of others, not known for our differences.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   Do you want to know them? I'm so glad you said yes. Did you say yes online?
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:35.840]   So I want to give all the credit for these suggested ways to a course that we run regularly
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:41.360]   at the Vine called The Difference Course. Now this was created by a reconciliation ministry
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.560]   and it has the vision to empower Christians to live together in this conflicted world.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.920]   And it begins by choosing to lean towards each other.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:30:04.560]   We, like Jesus, can choose to actually touch the leper. Right? We, like Jesus, can choose
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:14.720]   and be willing to go to the Gentile's house. Scandalous, right? Do we want to be scandalous,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:25.840]   Christians? No? Yes? Yes. Okay, number one, be curious. Be curious. We've all got our own story,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:35.920]   right? Every one of us here has our own story. And taking time to know our stories is a powerful
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:45.520]   way to step towards understanding each other better. If we can accept that we do not know
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:51.760]   everything and we are not always right, if we can choose to take a posture of humility towards
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:58.080]   others, as Promise highlighted a couple of weeks ago, we begin to see others differently.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:04.160]   Asking questions is a great way to do this. Tell me, why do you think like that?
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:12.640]   Help me understand your perspective. I've never seen it like that, but that's helpful. How do I
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:20.960]   find out more about that? When I stopped to really understand more about the beliefs of my colleagues
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:29.520]   in the Middle East, I began to see them differently. Their strict religious code meant that men were
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:38.400]   not allowed to associate with any woman unless it was their own family. Very strict code.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:47.680]   So, of course, it wasn't about me personally, and knowing that helped me not to take offense.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:55.200]   I may disagree with many of the practices and restraints for women in that country. And yes,
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:03.440]   I do see injustice, but choosing to break down my own wall of judgment and assumption about a culture
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:10.880]   and my colleagues, I was able to form relationships within that culture that enriched my life,
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:18.240]   but did more than that. Hopefully, I was a better witness for Jesus too.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:30.480]   You know, Jesus asked questions. Google told me over 300 questions were recorded in the gospel,
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:35.920]   which I find really interesting because I think, "Jesus, you knew everything. Jesus had the answers
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:43.040]   to everything, right? He was God, and yet he still asked questions." So if Jesus can ask questions,
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:51.200]   we can ask questions too. Who do you need to reach out to and be curious with?
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:33:00.960]   Number two, be present. All right, how many times have we entered into conversation with others
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:09.440]   with an agenda to prove we are right and they are wrong? You don't have to answer that question.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:15.120]   For example, during COVID, we've all met people with different views on vaccinations, right?
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:22.640]   It's our duty to be vaccinated to keep society safe. It's controlling and against our human
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:29.120]   rights. Many different views, often polarized, even within the church.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:36.800]   When we are listening to someone, are we actively listening or are we formulating an
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:44.320]   counter-argument in our heads? The moment they have finished speaking, we are giving our point
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:50.240]   of view. We all know what it is like to have someone listen to us, but they're not really
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.080]   listening. Their body language, their eye contact, their responses, they show this.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:05.760]   But if you were to choose to put aside your own agenda of being right and actually listen,
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:15.120]   be present with someone, even if you disagree, they will feel heard and they will feel respected.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.480]   That breaks down walls. We can be in relationship with others and agree to disagree.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:31.600]   So how is your defensiveness, maybe, pride, or fear of being with people that are different to you?
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:40.400]   Contributed to you not really listening? Who do you need to make a step towards
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:47.920]   reconciliation today with a posture of humility by choosing to be present with them?
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:59.920]   Number three, reimagine. Imagine what the world would be like if we as Christians were known for
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:08.240]   our love and understanding of each other in the midst of disagreement. Imagine if I could have
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:15.680]   a conversation about my faith with an unbelieving parent or brother or sister without it ending in
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:24.880]   an argument over idol worship. Rather, I trusted the Holy Spirit to be at work in my conversation.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:34.800]   Imagine a church where everyone felt accepted, could find a place to belong without judgment,
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:44.720]   without criticism, where community groups were full of people that were a little bit different
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:53.440]   to each other, but they intentionally made a commitment to do life together in their differences.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:36:02.720]   Imagine a city where different generations commit to putting aside their differences
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:11.520]   in order to mentor, to support, work together to give back to the city of Hong Kong.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:22.080]   You see, reimagining is about trusting the Holy Spirit. It is about trusting the powerful work
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:29.840]   of the Holy Spirit. The leper imagined being healed and he reached out to Church Jesus,
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:38.480]   even though he knew he should not have done that. The centurion imagined having one with
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:46.960]   greater authority than he did, different religion, different social status, willing to heal his
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:56.720]   servant. Imagine. Being curious, being present, reimagining, these are all practical ways to
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:02.880]   approach others as we choose to move towards being in reconciliation, living in a peace,
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:12.240]   where is possible, with those that are different to us. Jesus said, "By this, all people will know
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:19.200]   you are my disciples, if you have love for one another." So I want to be known as the disciple
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.880]   of Jesus because of my love for others. I want to live in reconciliation with my brothers and
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:31.920]   sisters, not division. I want this church to be a place where people feel safe to come because
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:37.520]   they know they won't be judged or discriminated because of their differences.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:44.240]   Finally, if people are drawn to us because of our love,
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:50.560]   our humility, our kindness, our compassion, they're drawn to Jesus, right?
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:38:02.240]   And through Jesus, Jesus is the ultimate remedy in relationships for all of humanity
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:14.960]   because through Jesus, we get to be reconciled to our God. Imagine that.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.800]   May I pray with us? Would you stand?
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:33.600]   Again, I don't want to oversimplify what it means to struggle in relationships.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:41.840]   And I would say that we all have broken relationships. It's very true for me as well.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.320]   But we can take steps. And maybe today, something that you've heard today
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:55.120]   will give you the courage you need to take one step towards living differently.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.880]   And as we were praying earlier, there's one thing that came to mind.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:11.360]   Michelle shared about this picture of embers. And I can see that in this place right now.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:18.400]   Embers. Embers of relationship that potentially could go out.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:26.160]   And the Holy Spirit wants you to reimagine what it could look like if they were fanned
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:32.880]   back into flame. And maybe that's something for you here or watching online.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:41.280]   Maybe for you, even the idea of reconciliation triggers something in you, and it's really painful.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:49.760]   Then I encourage you to sit with the Holy Spirit and ask him to show you what it would mean to
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:58.960]   imagine something different with that person, if possible. Or maybe you found yourself pulling back
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:04.560]   from somebody, and the Holy Spirit is nudging you to move towards that person,
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:13.920]   find out their story, stop judging or making assumptions because you think you know what is
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:23.840]   right. Whatever it may be today, our prayer is that you would know the Holy Spirit bringing to mind
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:30.560]   how you are to take this message and let it change you. The Word of God is powerful. These are not
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:40.080]   just words on a paper. They are words on a paper, but the Holy Spirit breathes life through the Word
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:49.680]   of God, through the Holy Spirit. So allow what has been spoken over us to change us, to make us the
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:57.680]   people that draw others to Jesus, because we're known for our love. So Father, as we come before
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:03.840]   you now, we do so knowing that we're all broken in different ways. We've all failed in relationships
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:11.040]   in different ways. We've all judged. We've all criticized, made assumptions. But Father, help us
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:19.200]   to follow the role model of Jesus, who dared to touch a leper and dared to hang out at a
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:29.120]   centurion's house when everyone around him would have said no. Father, help us to move towards
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:39.280]   people, not away. Give us the courage we need. Fill us by your Spirit. May we be curious, be present,
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:50.480]   and may we allow your Spirit to reimagine what we could be like with the power of God at work.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:56.880]   In Jesus' name, amen.
