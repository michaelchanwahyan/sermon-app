1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 All right. Well, good morning everybody

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 Like I said, thank you fran. It's good to see familiar faces in a new place, you know

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
 I've been saying it feels like it feels like home, but also feels like a new environment

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,720
 So i'm really glad to be it's a joy and an honor to be with you today

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,560
 Um, I just love so much what god has been doing in this process of us

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,560
 Praying discerning where to set up the church plant and now being established here in yunlong and the message today

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,920
 Fran had a word and pre-service you guys had a word about not giving up and that's basically the gist of today's message

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,920
 Don't give up keep going because there's a beautiful plan

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,300
 That god wants to work through this church and this community

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,320
 So our role is to press on to be kept being led by jesus. Amen

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,520
 Amen, good. So like fran said, my name's allison part of the parasol team and one chi and hopefully i'll be here a bit more

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,600
 Often to really get to know

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,280
 Each other but for now, let's take a look at god's word together

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,240
 So if you have a bible or if you want to I think it might be on the screen

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
 We're going to be in hebrews chapter 10

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,360
 Versus 19 to 25 hebrews chapter 10 versus 19 to 25

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,640
 Welcome to you if you're joining us online as well, so i'm going to read it try and follow along

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,240
 Where the lord says this therefore brothers and sisters

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,720
 Since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of jesus by a new and living way

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,480
 Open for us through the curtain. That is his body. Thank you. Justin

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,440
 And since we have a great priest over the house of god

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,160
 That a straw near to god with a sincere heart with the assurance with the full assurance that faith brings

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:43,040
 Having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,280
 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess for he who promised is faithful

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,320
 And now let's consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,720
 Not giving up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,580
 But encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day approaching

28
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,720
 One of my favorite movies

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,400
 Maybe not my favorite the most nostalgic movies for me of all time is the original karate kid

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,080
 Right the one with ralph macchio not the one with jaden smith and jackie chan

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,680
 Okay, the original karate kid right in a very basic synopsis. This is what happens, right?

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,920
 Um, there's it's about a boy called daniel who's being bullied right daniel la russo

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,700
 He's bullying he's being bullied and so he finds the handyman right in his building. Mr. Miyagi

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,320
 And actually, mr. Miyagi is a martial arts expert

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,400
 And so mr. Miyagi sees him being bullied one day and he decides i'm going to teach this kid karate

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,800
 All right, so he takes daniel's son under his wing to train him up

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,440
 Enter him into the local karate competition so he can defeat his bullies and be done with the harassment once and for all

38
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,680
 But to daniel's disappointment, mr. Miyagi's training tactics are at first a bit

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
 Unorthodox to say the least right instead of teaching daniel karate movements

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,120
 First of all, he has him doing household chores, right?

41
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,080
 Things like washing and waxing his car like wax on wax off wax on wax off right sanding the floor

42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,680
 Okay painting the fence painting his house

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,000
 Right, and so he does this for weeks and weeks and weeks and he's getting really frustrated daniel's saying what is the point?

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,680
 Right. I thought you're going to teach me karate instead. You have me doing your chores, right?

45
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,260
 Just doing manual labor and he's getting more and more frustrated

46
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,080
 And then comes like this magical moment in the movie, right?

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,120
 He's talking to mr. Miyagi having his you know, venting his frustrations and mr

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,440
 Miyagi says hit me and he's like what just hit me. Oh, no, actually i'm gonna hit you. Mr

49
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,800
 Miyagi goes to hit him. Okay, and as the fist comes in

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,760
 Reaction just you know muscle memory kicks in and daniel like blocks his punch

51
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,960
 And hits his thing and blocks his punch and blocks his punch and mr

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,920
 Miyagi keeps hitting him he all these movements he's been actually doing go and check out the movie tonight

53
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,120
 Okay have actually been training him right to block all of mr. Miyagi's movements. I'm not a martial arts expert by any means, okay

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:19,200
 But that's what he was doing right wax on wax off all these things were actually movements to block

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,760
 punches coming in

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
 And suddenly it all makes sense

57
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,880
 Right. Mr. Miyagi was actually through these things preparing him for something already

58
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,760
 And so when we get to the passage today

59
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,160
 This is sort of what it's been like in the book of hebrews up till this point

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,800
 The writer of hebrews has been preparing his readers for something, but it's not quite clear what he's been preparing them for

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,000
 Right. He's been explaining to them who jesus is

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,800
 Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice right the one and best sacrifice the ultimate sacrifice for all sins

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 Jesus fulfills the will of god by dying for our sins because of jesus god no longer remembers our sinful and lawless deeds

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
 But so what?

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,880
 What does it mean for us? Like what meaning does this have what does jesus's life has to do with our life?

66
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,200
 And it's in this moment. We realize all these things have been preparing us for one thing

67
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,880
 And that is to worship god to worship him

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
 to get us ready to enter into

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,640
 Worship, in fact all these things have happened

70
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,560
 The book of hebrews says to tell us that so that we can worship god in confidence first 19 says this therefore

71
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
 brothers and sisters

72
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,120
 Since now we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of jesus

73
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,920
 Because of what jesus has done. We are ready to worship him. We are ready to enter into the most

74
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,120
 Holy place we have the confidence to enter into the most holy place

75
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,480
 In other words, there's no need to doubt anymore

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,000
 Now to us this might not sound like a huge deal, but in the context of biblical history

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,880
 We have to remember there was a time where perhaps people were not as confident to go in approach and worship god

78
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
 To understand the significance of this, right?

79
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,800
 We have to go back to the place where once upon a time there was called the most holy place

80
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,920
 The holy of holies was where the spirit of god was set to have dwelt

81
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
 But going into that place

82
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,700
 Wasn't something that was supposed to be done lightheartedly

83
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:35,600
 And in order to enter the most holy place there needed to be sacrifices and rituals as instructed by old testament law

84
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,880
 And only certain priests at certain times could go into the presence of god and if it wasn't done properly

85
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
 You risked your life

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
 You could result in death

87
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,220
 But now since jesus has prepared since god has prepared us since jesus has become the ultimate

88
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,960
 Sacrifice because his blood has washed away all sin

89
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,600
 We don't need to be afraid

90
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,580
 And now all of us can enter into the presence of god with confidence

91
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,360
 We don't need to go through the formalities of sacrifices and rituals

92
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,560
 We don't need to worry about whether we're qualified as a priest to enter into god's presence because jesus has qualified us

93
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,720
 by his blood

94
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,880
 All we simply need to do now is approach god

95
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,840
 Hebrews 10 10 says like this we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of jesus christ once and for all

96
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,920
 And so this is I love so much hearing everybody worship just now because it was with such heartfelt voices that we sang that song

97
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,260
 To those songs together, right? It was with such confidence

98
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,200
 Knowing that what we were singing is true knowing that what we were singing is the word of god not because of what we have done

99
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,320
 But because of what jesus has done for us

100
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,160
 We sing those songs confidently and that is such a beautiful and amazing thing

101
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
 Now

102
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,960
 Don't get it twisted though church being confident does not mean being casual about it

103
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,680
 Right, we can enter with confidence. We don't need the sacrifices. We don't need the rituals because of what jesus has done

104
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
 But that confidence shouldn't be casual

105
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,640
 Having that confidence should actually shape us in certain ways as a people of god

106
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,220
 Right and being a confident person in god. Actually, I think there are four characteristics

107
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,760
 that this um

108
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:37,040
 That this passage highlights to us the four characteristics of being a confident person a person that's confident to worship jesus

109
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,280
 Number one it tells us this we have sincere hearts

110
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,160
 in other words

111
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:51,200
 When you enter into a place of worship when you enter that space with god when you're worshipping him our hearts have to be

112
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
 sincere

113
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
 There is no pretense

114
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,720
 As people who have been transformed by god the process starts from the inside

115
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,840
 Having sincere hearts think of it this way

116
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,200
 Have you ever tried to build a relationship with someone that you know, you knew their heart wasn't really in it

117
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,500
 Right, you're pouring yourself out to them. You're you're sharing them with your stories. Um, there's a anyone here watch love is blind on netflix

118
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,600
 No, shame. Oh shame on you. No, no, okay

119
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,920
 Terrible show right my wife and I binged it

120
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,560
 Last these last couple of days. All right

121
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,160
 Okay, it's a whole idea you meet someone, you know through a wall through the pods and you fall in love, you know

122
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
 Um, and it's to test right whether love or not is really blind, right?

123
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,200
 You you see the people for who they are until you meet them physically, right?

124
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,840
 It's a process having sincere hearts that starts from the inside

125
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,200
 But when you try to build a relationship with someone whose heart is not in it, it's really difficult, right?

126
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's not it's not a good thing at all. You're giving more and more of yourself and the person is giving nothing in return

127
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,760
 It's horrible

128
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,160
 Or think about maybe you're in a job, right? Maybe some of you have been in a job or in a job

129
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,320
 You show up every day you go through the motions. Yes, it brings in some money

130
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,440
 It pays the bills, but it's not really what your heart is about

131
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,240
 And you dream of doing something different you dream of being filled to your potential doing something that you were made to do

132
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:24,260
 There is no joy when the heart is not sincere. There is no life in a heart that is not sincere

133
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,200
 A heart that's sincere is also one that's loyal and devoted that doesn't change like the blowing of the wind a sincere heart

134
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,000
 Is one of the most precious things you can give to god in your worship to him

135
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
 so church

136
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,520
 This morning

137
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,400
 Our hearts sincere like when you sang those songs just now when you pray for each other

138
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,960
 Do you really mean it from your heart?

139
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,400
 That's the first thing

140
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,560
 Second thing is this with complete assurance of faith

141
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,040
 Complete assurance of faith. In other words, there is no doubt

142
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,980
 Your faith is what gives you the ability to worship god in full confidence

143
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:13,760
 Right your faith that you're not wondering whether god is is happy with you or you're not wondering whether god you you

144
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,400
 You know you're qualified to approach god

145
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,800
 You don't have to worry about if god accepts us because if your hearts are sincere

146
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,440
 Your heart's also going to be full of faith

147
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,600
 And we base our faith on jesus

148
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,960
 We can have faith because of who jesus is and what he has done for us

149
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,240
 Scripture calls jesus the author and perfecter of our faith

150
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,360
 And so when you feel like your faith is down

151
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,680
 Look to him

152
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,320
 And be assured that because of what jesus has done

153
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,400
 we can

154
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,300
 Enter into worship with full confidence

155
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,120
 Third thing is this it says with our hearts sprinkled clean

156
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,200
 To say something has been made clean means that it was once dirty, right?

157
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,520
 We get this idea right things get dirty a lot. So we have to wash them your body

158
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,680
 Hopefully your hair your teeth your clothes your dishes. These are things we have to wash almost every day

159
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,440
 But what does it mean to have your hearts your hearts sprinkled clean?

160
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,880
 Again, the writer is trying to remind us of what god has already done for us

161
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,600
 We have all different walks of life here from young to old

162
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,120
 But as you reflect back on your life, i'm sure that there's things that you've done

163
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,000
 things that you've said

164
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
 Things that you've done to yourself or maybe to others that we regret

165
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,840
 right things that

166
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,460
 You know were wrong sins that you've committed against yourself

167
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,000
 and others

168
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,960
 And sometimes these things can weigh heavy on our hearts

169
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,960
 Things that we're not proud of things. Maybe we find. Oh, I hope nobody ever finds out about these things

170
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,320
 But again

171
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,560
 Because of what jesus has done

172
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:12,480
 Because his blood has paid the price. He's become the ultimate sacrifice. Our hearts are clean forever

173
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,760
 We are forgiven and we can come to jesus knowing that nothing

174
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,520
 Stands in the way of our relationship with him

175
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:29,840
 So church the question for us this morning is also this have you allowed your hearts to be sprinkled clean?

176
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,880
 Have you asked for god's forgiveness?

177
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,400
 Do you receive god's forgiveness to wash your hearts clean so that you can be rid of those things once and for all?

178
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,600
 And continue to worship god with a clean

179
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
 and and pure heart

180
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,400
 And finally it says this with our bodies washed with pure water

181
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,960
 Now the renewing process doesn't of course end on the inside

182
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:03,040
 Because if you have been truly cleaned if our hearts are truly sprinkled clean that that should reflect from the inside out

183
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,020
 Right friend was talking about baptism. Just now. We like to call baptism an outward expression of an inward reality

184
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,240
 So saying that our bodies have been washed with pure water is saying that not only have our hearts been changed

185
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,720
 But the way we conduct ourselves what's visible that on the outside has also been changed and well as well

186
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,440
 The way we live our lives reflects the person who follows jesus

187
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,320
 What we claim has happened in our hearts affects the way we actually live

188
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,600
 Right and baptism is one of the best ways to display this on a literal level right in baptism

189
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,760
 We fully submerge a person the old life has been washed clean. They come out

190
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,540
 Symbolically with a new life

191
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,200
 with a new identity in christ

192
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,880
 But that also has to affect the way we live our lives the way we treat other the words that come out of our mouth

193
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,180
 The way we think the way we participate in community

194
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,240
 When our bodies are washed with pure water

195
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,000
 It means we are not ashamed now of our identity in jesus

196
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,120
 And that we strive to live life as a follower of him

197
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,640
 It means that people should notice. Well, this person was once, you know a certain kind of way

198
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,640
 But now that they've become a christian now that their lives have changed now that they've been washed the hearts have been made clean

199
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,200
 They're living in faith. They're sincere people

200
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,760
 I've noticed a difference in this person

201
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,280
 Have our bodies also been washed with pure water

202
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,040
 So these are the characteristics

203
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,540
 And these are these these are things we have to do as individuals. We have to take responsibility

204
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,280
 Of our own relationship with jesus of this process as well

205
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,120
 But then this is the most amazing things if we as individuals have been trained up in these areas

206
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,460
 If we are practicing these things then when we come together as a community

207
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,200
 That's where change can really start to happen

208
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,720
 That's what the community of god has been called to be

209
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
 right a community

210
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
 walks in these steps

211
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,740
 Hearts cleanse assurance of faith all these things we then hold on it says unswervingly

212
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,840
 to the hope we profess

213
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,140
 For he who promised is faithful

214
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,040
 If we're people that practice these things and we become a community that always holds on to hope

215
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,800
 And hope is probably one of the most important things to this city and to the world right now

216
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,960
 a community that holds on unswervingly means ones that to keep to retain to not bend to stay straight to have a

217
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,320
 solid foundation of what we put our hope in

218
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,000
 Means that if all other people everything else has let go of hope we never will

219
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,240
 We are not the people that will quit when things get hard

220
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,360
 And this is what our people need

221
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,800
 We've we've noticed this in our church service here in yunlong and in wanchai. We've been talking about this right how the city needs hope

222
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,720
 Depression rates are on the rise suicide rates are on the rise. Our students are literally in danger every day

223
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,200
 thinking about taking that

224
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,840
 horrible step of taking their own lives

225
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,640
 People in this city are living as if those all hope is lost

226
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,680
 And when you lose hope you lose ambition

227
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:30,800
 And you just start doing the bare minimum to get by right? Nobody's really believing these days. I feel like that they'll ever amount to anything

228
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,280
 That the only hope they have is that the things that things will never change

229
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,640
 And so nothing changes

230
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,320
 Students saying what's the point in studying hard if all I ever get is bad grades

231
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,000
 I never i'll never live up to those expectations. So what's the point?

232
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,240
 What's the point of working so hard when my boss never notices me?

233
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,220
 Anyways, I never get the promotions. I never get the raises. I never get even the smallest bit of recognition

234
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,840
 What's the point in me applying myself at work?

235
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,760
 What's the point in working on relationships every time I try to reach out people are not friendly

236
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,200
 Every time i'm vulnerable with someone it gets thrown back in my face

237
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,480
 There's no hope in people changing

238
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,960
 What's the point in having a dream? What's the hope in that where I every single dream of mine has been crushed?

239
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,400
 I've never had anything good happen in my life

240
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,840
 There's so many people in our city that are trapped in this state of hopelessness and you could keep adding to this list

241
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,400
 But what I found out is this I think what is what I what i've been as I read god's word i've been praying

242
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
 Why do people lose hope?

243
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,400
 They lose hope because they fail to see that they're actually amazing creations who've been made in god's image

244
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,620
 They lose hope because they don't know what we know that they can approach god the maker the creator at any time in confidence

245
00:18:53,620 --> 00:19:00,800
 And have them know his love his forgiveness his acceptance, but when people don't know that they don't have the hope

246
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,040
 But church, this is where we can come in and make a difference

247
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:14,060
 Remember, we are a people right with sincere hearts with bold faith cleanse for sin living for jesus

248
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,740
 Which means we follow a living hope, right?

249
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:24,940
 The hope that we profess is that no matter how hard things get and certainly things do get hard in life

250
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:32,860
 We have a god who loves us and cares for us and wants the best for us who has amazing plan and purpose for every

251
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,260
 single person that he created

252
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,180
 And so the hope that we profess is that nothing is impossible for the lord

253
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,580
 The hope that we profess is that the future is in god's hands

254
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,880
 The hope that we profess is that we can rejoice even in times of tribulations

255
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,140
 The hopes that we profess is that he will never leave us or forsake us

256
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,180
 The hope that we profess is that jesus loves you

257
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:05,660
 That he died on the cross for you, but he also was raised back to life defeating sin and death

258
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,380
 And the hope that we profess is that one day

259
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:15,180
 Jesus will come back to make all things new and we will get to be with him forever

260
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,700
 You see how important hope is church

261
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,580
 So we cannot let go of hope

262
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,380
 Not even for a moment hold

263
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,460
 unswervingly

264
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,460
 to the hope that we profess

265
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,260
 As a community we've been called to keep our grip on hope strong

266
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,140
 Because we need it and the world's need it and the world needs it

267
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:44,380
 God is faithful and we can always trust in him. We can always have hope in him

268
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,380
 Remember church our hope is in the lord

269
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,300
 Now this is not an easy task

270
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,940
 It's going to take strength. It's going to take courage to keep declaring hope in hopeless places

271
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,880
 And again, this is why we've been called to do this as a community

272
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,060
 Right. We were never meant to do this alone

273
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,460
 God has always called us to be the body of christ a community that lives out hope hope put on display

274
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,060
 Right, which is why coming to yunlong was such a significant thing

275
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:22,300
 For us as a church family for us to move to a place that we saw needed hope needed light needed life

276
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,740
 And now we've placed ourselves here and the testimonies we've been hearing

277
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:32,540
 Ivan and chapman and june have been sharing have all been testimonies of speaking hope into a place that didn't once see it

278
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,500
 So we have to continue

279
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:42,460
 Scripture tells us this let us consider how we may spur each one another on towards love and good deeds

280
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:50,140
 Not giving meeting not giving up meeting one another as some are in the habit of doing but encouraging one another

281
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,220
 You have you noticed how people

282
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,580
 Change according to the environment that they're in

283
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,940
 Right. Sometimes you can call this mob mentality, right?

284
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,620
 It's it's a real thing when people are in a large crowd they act in certain ways and do certain things

285
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,120
 They they normally wouldn't do if they were by themselves

286
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,500
 Right many times this has negative connotations. I grew up in a british boarding school

287
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,420
 So mob mentality was you know

288
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,980
 Like one you get a group of boys together with a lot of time on their hands and not much to do

289
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,580
 Most of the time they get up to no good right most of the time high chance, you know

290
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,060
 I'll continue i'll tell you stories and maybe not now. Okay. This is being recorded afterwards

291
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,180
 If you want to hear some stories, i'll share some stories with you, right?

292
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,120
 But this mentality can also be used for the positive

293
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,060
 Right because what if we got together?

294
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,540
 And the effect that we had on each other was to do good and awesome things

295
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:51,100
 What if once every time we got to the get the together as a community our heart was to serve the poor

296
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,020
 To take care of the widows and the orphans and to inspire others to do the same and even more

297
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,700
 Right. This is the reason we've been called like I said to be the body of christ

298
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,700
 This is why god has gifted us in different ways. This is why jesus had a group of disciples

299
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,140
 This is why people have literally risked their lives and even died for the community of god

300
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,300
 Because they know that when we get together there is a strength

301
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,780
 There is a hope that we can do that is not possible just done by one person on their own

302
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:33,100
 And the type of community that god wants to see is one that spurs each other towards love and good deeds

303
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:40,380
 Right. It has to flow together church. We can't just keep proclaiming. We have hope we have hope we preach hope we speak hope

304
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,200
 But not do anything to show love to the community

305
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
 They have to go hand in hand

306
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,740
 Let me give you an example of my own life

307
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,500
 A few years ago, my wife and I started the journey of being foster parents

308
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,180
 We have two of our own children our biological children now, but in the previous season we were foster parents

309
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,700
 And we share this story often with other people and they ask, you know, why did you choose to be foster family?

310
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,020
 Was it a hard decision?

311
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,140
 And in truth actually it wasn't really a hard thing to decide

312
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,580
 But we chose to be foster parents to kids because well firstly the bible tells us to

313
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,300
 Right. It says look after the widows and the orphans

314
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,020
 And so we thought well, this is literally how we can put our faith into action, right?

315
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:29,180
 We don't we felt like we didn't even need to pray about it because god commands in the bible to look after the widows and the orphans

316
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,940
 But also we were inspired by others, right? We there was a it was during the justice conference

317
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,940
 we heard a talk by someone who was

318
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,380
 A foster family and they how much of an impact they kept making in the lives of these children

319
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,020
 Other families that spoke to us about the joy that these foster children brought into their lives

320
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,700
 families opened their homes welcoming children in need

321
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:58,620
 families sacrificing time money energy energy blood sweat and tears to champion the cause of vulnerable children

322
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,580
 And honestly, we didn't know what we were doing

323
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,060
 We had we didn't have any of the answers

324
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:10,700
 All we knew is that for the time that they needed it. We could provide a loving environment for these kids

325
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,300
 Other people had done it. So why not us?

326
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,460
 And that's how our journey started

327
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:27,180
 So church our challenge to each other today is this can we encourage each other in the same way

328
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,640
 Like when we gather together as a community

329
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,420
 When you meet with your friends

330
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,780
 In addition to thinking how can we bless each other? I wonder if we could start thinking a different way

331
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,580
 How can we challenge each other?

332
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,900
 You know because I think in general we're pretty good at blessing each other right for sitting together

333
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,620
 You know helping each other out when we're in need

334
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:55,980
 Celebrating together. These are good and wonderful things and we need to keep doing things these things as we go along

335
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,900
 But my thought is this

336
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,060
 If we really want to grow as a church

337
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:08,060
 If we really want to grow as a community if we want to change the culture and the society around us

338
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:14,140
 That's not just going to happen if we just gathered by ourselves all the time if we're just internally focused

339
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:20,320
 If we want other people to experience the same hope that we so love that we profess

340
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,900
 Then we need to be provoking each other to good deeds

341
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,940
 And yes, this is going to be stepping outside of your comfort zones a little bit

342
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,380
 But true growth only happens when we step outside our comfort zones

343
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,660
 So, how might this work practically?

344
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:44,940
 It's quite simple. You can be as creative as you want say you're planning your next community group gathering, right?

345
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,620
 Instead of thinking. Okay, what can we do with ourselves? What bible study can we do today?

346
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,740
 Just twist, you know, just flip the question a little bit

347
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,780
 You could ask how can we as a group serve others at this time?

348
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,140
 Well, maybe you've noticed you have a friend who has a particular talent, right?

349
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:07,100
 You could come alongside them and say hey, you know, i've noticed you're really good at whatever, right?

350
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,980
 Have you ever thought how you could use that to bless others?

351
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,780
 Actually, you know who's tim pastor tim is really good at this

352
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:20,620
 He's really good at noticing things about people and then calling out of the i've had countless conversations with him

353
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,260
 Where i've been feeling down and out a little, you know

354
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,780
 A little bit wobbly and he's sat me down looked me in the eye and say, you know, allison

355
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:32,300
 I see this in you as a friend as a pastor as someone who I love, you know

356
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,260
 I've noticed these things that you don't give up keep going

357
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,140
 How about those conversations? Are we are we?

358
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,500
 Are we familiar with those conversations that we can have with each other?

359
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,860
 Or you could say something like this, you know

360
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:51,660
 You've planned something and invite others along the way chapman had a really good point in his cantonese service about bringing the next generation

361
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,940
 Along right and inviting them to join in in what you're doing

362
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:00,880
 Let them see what you're doing and let them experience it so they too can learn how to do it for themselves

363
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,780
 But this isn't just going to happen on its own

364
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:10,380
 It needs some sort of instigation. It needs some sort of catalyst and the more we're willing to do this

365
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,420
 The more natural it become until it becomes embedded as a part of our culture

366
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,680
 Until we just very naturally start doing these things as a community

367
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,420
 And a community that thinks and acts this way is literally one that brings god's hope on earth as it is in heaven

368
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,000
 Everybody can do this

369
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,700
 We all have gifts. We all have talents. It's not a question about spiritual gifts

370
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,980
 We don't have that excuse because god made you for a plan and a purpose. So don't say you're not gifted

371
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,660
 Don't say I don't have the time or the skills together. You can

372
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,580
 And it will be tough

373
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,900
 It will take time

374
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,420
 But nothing good ever comes out of an easy process, right?

375
00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:01,740
 When we do tough things when we do hard things we go through these things together god uses it for his glory

376
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,380
 God uses it to speak hope

377
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,860
 It's going to take time it's going to take effort

378
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:15,500
 Which is why the writer encourages them to not give up doing this

379
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:23,580
 Do not give up meeting together as some as in the habit of doing but keep encouraging one another

380
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,940
 Now again on the surface, it seems like this is just talking about gathering for worship

381
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,900
 And yes, of course, there is an element of that in this is in this what you guys have on a sunday

382
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:40,620
 You know in the cantonese service and the english service people coming together, right? This has been nothing short of a miracle

383
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,980
 And god continues to bring people to the worship services and we praise him for that

384
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,620
 So certainly don't keep up meeting like this. This is awesome. This is great

385
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,540
 It's a special honor and a privilege to this time and this place

386
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:59,180
 We dreamed of this at one point and now god has answered that prayer

387
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,220
 but at the same time church

388
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,940
 We say all the time here, too

389
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,500
 It's much more than what happens at 90 minutes on a sunday morning

390
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:17,020
 So it's when it says don't give up meeting each other. They encourage and not it's not just saying don't stop meeting on a sunday

391
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:24,060
 It's calling us. Don't stop being the church. Don't stop being the body of christ at all times

392
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:32,220
 Apparently for whatever reasons when the writer was writing this he thought there were some things that were distracting people to stop them from

393
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,620
 being the family in christ

394
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,740
 For them it was a threat of persecution maybe an enticement of worshipping idols

395
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:46,940
 Details I think are left a bit vague on purpose because there are an endless amount of things that can stop us from gathering

396
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,020
 That can make us give up

397
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,340
 Meeting with each other and encouraging each other

398
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:58,300
 So as we go about living life like this we too have to ask ourselves the question be very honest

399
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:05,660
 Well, what are some reasons? What are some threats to us stopping for to us giving up meeting each other like this?

400
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,020
 Busyness is one

401
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,340
 Hong kong is a busy place. There's no denying that

402
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,460
 laziness

403
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,460
 more entertaining plans

404
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,140
 Right. We love double confirming triple confirming and if something better comes up

405
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,820
 We're and then we jump ship and do that instead of things we'd originally planned, right?

406
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,380
 That's just part of our hong kong culture sometimes

407
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:31,020
 Miscommunication conflict with the community

408
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,260
 Unforgiveness gossip slander the list could go on too

409
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
 And

410
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,380
 Like I said, this is a tough thing that god is calling us to

411
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:50,620
 And moving in the direction where god has called us. It's going to take a level of courage

412
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,140
 It's going to take tenacity. It's going to take grit

413
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:02,620
 But I will say this like I said all of us are able to take this challenge on if we work together

414
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:11,820
 Time and time again in courage scripture encourages the people of god to stand firm to be constant to be strong to not lose heart

415
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,500
 Because i'll say it again the truth is nothing good and worthy

416
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,260
 Has ever been gained without going through something tough?

417
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,140
 something challenging

418
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,940
 If it's easy, it's probably not going to be great at the end

419
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:33,180
 But be encouraged church you were made for this

420
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:41,100
 Scripture calls us more than conquerors scripture tells us that nothing can separate us from the love of god

421
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,340
 And if the love of god is best displayed through us gathering together

422
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:53,100
 Speaking and acting in hope towards the community around us then we have been called to give everything we have in order to do this

423
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,300
 so church

424
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,740
 Don't give up

425
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,540
 Being the body of christ that is always

426
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,740
 Always encouraging each other to show love to live out. Hope

427
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:11,260
 This is an investment that does not return void

428
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,220
 Galatians 6 9 tells us this

429
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,260
 Let us never go weary in doing what is right for if we do not give up

430
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,860
 We will reap our harvest in due time

431
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,860
 So whenever we have an opportunity, let us do good to all people

432
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,460
 It's worth your effort

433
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,420
 This world needs a hope it needs the love that we so

434
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:40,380
 profess and hold in our hearts and claim to live out as a community of faith

435
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,500
 And we have an opportunity to do that church

436
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,820
 But there is also an urgency to it

437
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:56,400
 This passage ends by saying this and all the more as you see the day approaching

438
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,960
 All the more as you see the day approaching

439
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,300
 In other words, we have no time to waste

440
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,980
 Right what we've talked about isn't something we can just stick on the back burner and come back to later

441
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,020
 The time to start living this way to start time to start being the body of christ

442
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,780
 That's time to start preaching and living our hope is now

443
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,280
 Is right now because the day is approaching

444
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,780
 We don't know when jesus will return

445
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,220
 Right scripture tells us that his hope is that none of us perish

446
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:35,980
 But until that day comes and no one knows when that day will be and if someone ever does you don't believe them

447
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,340
 Okay, no one knows when that day is

448
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:45,820
 The writers of the scripture seemed to think it was in him in the time. Jesus coming was imminent

449
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,780
 Yet it still hasn't happened yet

450
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,940
 So we really don't know

451
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,580
 But what we do know is that we have a task to do at hand

452
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,220
 We have a mission. We have a hope that the city needs

453
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,500
 And so there is no time to waste

454
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,700
 If jesus comes back today

455
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,060
 We can face him and say I lived out that life of hope

456
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:16,220
 We as a church lived out that life of hope we did everything we did to preach hope and love to the people around us

457
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,340
 So they too could have the same hope that we have

458
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,820
 If jesus comes back in a hundred years, we can say we were faithful all this time until the day

459
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,420
 Jesus came back and said come home now

460
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:38,060
 We will not stop until we hear the words well done good and faithful servants

461
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,500
 And so church, this is our task

462
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,180
 We have this hope we have this love we have the ability we have the resources

463
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,860
 We have the energy if we all work together as a body of christ

464
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:58,220
 This hope is literally what the city and the world needs to make a change an eternal change a lasting change

465
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,540
 A hope that will never let them down

466
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,740
 So church will we step up to the challenge today

467
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:13,820
 The call is to carry on being his love and hope to each other in a world that is hungry to know him

468
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,580
 I pray that we're here in yunlong here in wanchai no matter where we are if you're watching online

469
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:25,100
 We come together to do this to speak hope to the city that needs it

470
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,340
 Let's pray

471
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:42,460
 Jesus we thank you for your faithfulness and I know it's my first sunday here today. So that's fresh on my mind and

472
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
 but it's just such a

473
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,340
 Amazing thing that you have done lord with this space with this church

474
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,540
 here in yunlong

475
00:36:52,540 --> 00:37:01,280
 And this community that's been brought together lord the people that are sitting here lord, this is no mistake

476
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:10,140
 Each and every person he has a plan and a purpose they have been drawn here for a reason

477
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,980
 And so lord I pray that as a church as a community we would be known for people that always speaks hope

478
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,220
 We we would be known as a place that when people walk in

479
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,880
 Lost and hopeless they leave feeling encouraged and uplifted

480
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,180
 Knowing that they have a purpose knowing that they have a god who loves them

481
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:37,420
 Knowing that they were meant to do something greater than just lie flat and live out the rest of the days

482
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,260
 But father I know that we don't do this alone

483
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:49,900
 And so father give us the same heart and the same mind in this mission that you've given us as a church

484
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,060
 That together we would always be encouraging of one another

485
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,340
 That together we would work out our differences no matter what they are so that we can see beyond

486
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,700
 The difficulties and call out the best in each other

487
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:08,060
 That we would get to know each other on a level that allows us to challenge each other

488
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,220
 And

489
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:18,060
 In that way lord you are shaping and molding us you are saving your people through your church

490
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:24,620
 And that we are waiting the day lord and you come back and and join us

491
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,700
 And reclaim and restore and renew everything once again that true hope will once again

492
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,660
 Be the only thing that's left faith hope and love

493
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,340
 Until that day lord

494
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,500
 Keep us strong in faith in you

495
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,660
 And may we be a community that never gives up on this mission of living for you. Jesus

496
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,100
 We pray in your sweet and wonderful name

497
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,980
 Amen
