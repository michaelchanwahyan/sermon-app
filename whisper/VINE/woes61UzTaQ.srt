1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 As I was listening to that testimony, I was like, "Wow, he's just preached my whole word.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,560
 We can go home."

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,560
 No, we won't.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,720
 It's such a privilege and an honor to have been on the board of directors for Branches

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,680
 of Hope for the last three and a half years.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,920
 And today, being given the privilege to talk about something I'm passionate about, the

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,360
 work we do at Branches of Hope, and something I'm really passionate about, the work of compassion,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,880
 such a privilege.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,000
 My husband is here, day 11, and his name is KK.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,440
 I think Andrew spoke about it.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,080
 So if you hear him screaming, "Amen," he's just here to encourage me.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,080
 Amen.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,680
 So, yeah, I need all that encouragement.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,680
 Thank you, everyone.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,240
 So we're going to read from Matthew 22, 37 to 40.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,320
 So turn with me to Matthew 22, 37 to 40.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,760
 And Jesus replied, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul,

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,000
 and all your mind.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,720
 This is the first and greatest commandment.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,200
 A second is equally important.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,440
 Love your neighbor as yourself."

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,440
 So if you look at your neighbor, you're meant to love them, even if they're not your spouse.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,560
 So love your neighbor as you love yourself.

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,680
 The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,480
 That means this is a very important piece of scripture that we're looking at today.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,200
 Today is Branches of Hope Sunday, and it's no surprise that we're going to be speaking

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
 about love.

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,000
 Because, like mentioned before in the testimony, the people we are serving in Branches of Hope

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,360
 have experienced the very opposite of what we're talking about, this love.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,040
 They have experienced a brutality, most of them, that we can't even think or imagine.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,920
 What is worse is that they are far away from the loving families that could be helping

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,040
 them heal from the traumas that they've experienced.

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,160
 But I believe this community, you and I, God has placed us in this community to be that

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:10,080
 love, to be that church of hope that wraps its arms around those who are in need.

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
 This reminds me of a dream I had a few weeks ago.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,560
 And in this dream, I was shown a scripture but without the words.

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,000
 So I knew this was a scripture, and I sensed God was saying in the scripture, "The first

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,920
 part you're doing really well, but the second part you're not doing well."

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,880
 So the whole day, and this never came up, you know, Matthew 22.

40
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,080
 So the whole day I was thinking and agonizing, and I came to worship.

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,800
 Usually God speaks to me in worship.

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,360
 So I came to worship, I was agonizing, "God, you've got to tell me, because if you don't

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,760
 tell me, then I can't repent."

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
 Nothing.

45
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,060
 Then after that, the whole day I was really like, "God, you need to tell me," you know.

46
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,160
 And just before I went into a prayer meeting with some ladies, God began to reveal it.

47
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,840
 I think the suspense had to come for me to really weep for what God showed me.

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,960
 I then realized the second dream I'd had the same night was connected to the first.

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,280
 Because in the second dream, God had shown me someone who was in need.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,960
 God had shown me somebody who needed hospital fees.

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,320
 God had shown me the need of this person, but I had not called that person, I had not

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,920
 provided for that person, and I had certainly not prayed for that person.

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,440
 God called me out and weeping, I told the people I was in the prayer meeting with, and

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,840
 we're all weeping and repenting, because every single one of them realized they had done

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
 the same.

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,440
 In the busyness of life, especially in Hong Kong, we can sometimes be so too busy to even

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,320
 look at the need around us.

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:47,280
 But I believe God has even created today, this Sunday, for us to pause a little bit

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,740
 and see the need around us.

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,160
 The last two weeks, Pastor Andrew has really been unpacking what justice is, and it's been

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
 amazing.

62
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,880
 I'm not theologian, but today I'm going to unpack as well what branches of hope needs,

63
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,800
 and we believe all of us need, and that is love.

64
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,440
 In the first week, Pastor Andrew spoke about four key relationships.

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,200
 Us with God, and it seems from the dream I was doing well with that.

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,780
 Us with ourselves, I'm not sure about that because it wasn't revealed.

67
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,360
 But us with others, I wasn't doing so well there, and then us with creation.

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,280
 Today we're going to focus on us with others, and in particular with branches of hope.

69
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,160
 Last week, Pastor Andrew mentioned that you cannot call yourself a Christian and remain

70
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,220
 distant to the injustice in the society around you.

71
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,640
 When the plight of the asylum seekers and refugees in our church became so glaring,

72
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,340
 we could not keep quiet.

73
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,880
 We had to step forward.

74
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,200
 We had to see.

75
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,960
 We had to weep and begin to speak about what people were experiencing in this church.

76
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,800
 And not only that, branches of hope and the ministry of Arise was birthed from this need.

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,880
 And year after year, the voice of branches of hope has become louder and louder and louder

78
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,400
 because of the love, the prayers, and the generosity of the people in this room.

79
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,480
 The love, prayer, and giving of you has changed many lives and given hope to those in a dire

80
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,600
 situation.

81
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,880
 We also learned last week that the local church, the body of Christ, is always called to walk

82
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,440
 towards the community and love it.

83
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,520
 But in order for us to know what this love is really about, we're going to unpack a little

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,000
 bit of the Greek word for love in Matthew 22, verse 37 to 40.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,360
 There are actually four Greek words I want to speak about, and the last one is what we

86
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,480
 see in Matthew 22.

87
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,940
 So philia love, this is a brotherly love.

88
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,920
 This is an affectionate kind of love based on feelings and proximity.

89
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,160
 And then there's storge love, which is the family love.

90
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,000
 This is a bond created in being a family.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,100
 When I look at storge, nowadays I've got a teenage daughter, and she seems to be leaning

92
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,040
 more on philia than storge, but that's okay.

93
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,140
 Then there's eros love.

94
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,080
 This is a love normally based on feelings and passion for each other.

95
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,700
 But today we want to focus on agape love.

96
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,280
 This is a sacrificial and unconditional love.

97
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:29,240
 While philia, storge, and eros are basically primarily a love of emotion, agape is not

98
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,320
 primarily an act of feelings, though it can be involved, but a love of devotion and acts

99
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,840
 that flow from God.

100
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,720
 This kind of love in Matthew 22, verse 37 to 40 is agape.

101
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,440
 Today we're going to also look at some scriptures related to agape, because in the New Testament,

102
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,520
 agape is mentioned over 100 times.

103
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,120
 That means it's very important.

104
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,200
 But today we want to look at some of those scriptures, not all 100, but some of those

105
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,840
 scriptures in order for us to see what the definition of agape really is.

106
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,040
 So turn with me to 1 John 3, verse 16 to 18.

107
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,540
 We know what real love is, because Jesus gave up his life for us.

108
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,980
 So we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters.

109
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,560
 If someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister in need but shows

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,440
 no compassion, how can God's love be in that person?

111
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,840
 Dear children, let's not merely say that we love each other.

112
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,760
 Let us show the truth by our actions.

113
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,360
 This is a real scripture, everyone.

114
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,360
 Maybe sometimes you're like me, and I sometimes skip through some of these scriptures and

115
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,640
 think, "Oh, I know what God wants me to give," until God calls me out in a dream and says,

116
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
 "Pause.

117
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,680
 You need to look around you and really see."

118
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,460
 It is selfless, unconditional, and it flows from God.

119
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,520
 This is what we see from the scripture.

120
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,420
 It flows from God.

121
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,420
 It is selfless.

122
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,960
 It's looking at others.

123
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,760
 It is purposely looking for the need around us.

124
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,400
 God gave us his best, so we should also give our best.

125
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,220
 The love that God has poured in us during when we got saved is the same love he feels

126
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,040
 we should pour into other people.

127
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,800
 The primary way we share is action-oriented.

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,600
 The primary way God showed his love was action by sending Jesus Christ.

129
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,080
 The primary way he wants us to show our love is an action-oriented thing, by giving our

130
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,120
 time, by giving our resources, by giving our energy, by giving our prayer, and yes, by

131
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,920
 even giving financially to those who are in need.

132
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,440
 It is expressed through actions and deeds and not just words like we've just said.

133
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,840
 Turn with me to James 2, verse 8 and 18.

134
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,120
 It says, "Yes, indeed, it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the scriptures.

135
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
 Love your neighbor as yourself."

136
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,840
 Now someone may argue some people have faith, others have good deeds, but I say, "How can

137
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,960
 you show me your faith if you don't have good deeds?"

138
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,560
 I will show you my faith by my deeds.

139
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,160
 Agape is a doing word.

140
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,120
 Well, the other three are primarily nouns.

141
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,120
 If you don't remember, you can go back to your English.

142
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,320
 Agape is a doing word.

143
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,980
 To truly live out the word agape, we must partner our words with our actions.

144
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,580
 We must also move forward with our deeds.

145
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,400
 It is also a work of the Holy Spirit.

146
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,640
 Recently, we were having the Holy Spirit series and Galatians 5, verse 22 to 23 came up, but

147
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,640
 the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives, love, joy, peace, patience,

148
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,880
 kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

149
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,400
 There is no law against these things.

150
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,400
 When we were learning about the fruit of the Spirit, the word love in that verse is agape.

151
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,920
 We cannot agape in and of ourselves.

152
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,440
 We need the Holy Spirit to help us to agape because it is countercultural to agape.

153
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,680
 Where a culture says we give to get something back, agape says I would disadvantage myself

154
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,720
 for the good of others.

155
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,480
 I recently came across a friend sent me the story of Yvonne Roberts, the Welsh revivalist.

156
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,120
 He was a revivalist, a leading part of a revival in Wales in 1904 to 1905.

157
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,240
 Through the work of the Holy Spirit, there was a lot of prayer during that revival.

158
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,200
 There was a lot of people getting saved during that revival.

159
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,940
 The prisons were emptied during that revival.

160
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:56,280
 But the most amazing thing was there were no more people in need in Wales during that

161
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,720
 time, during that revival because everybody was led by the Holy Spirit to begin to go

162
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,700
 to the churches and begin to give whatever the Holy Spirit was compelling them to give.

163
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:16,600
 What a beautiful view of how God wants us to meet each other's needs.

164
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:29,960
 "It should flow from us to others just as it flowed from us to God, from God to us.

165
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,800
 It should flow from us to others just as it flowed from God to us."

166
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,720
 In John 13, 34 to 35, "So now I am giving you a new commandment.

167
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,680
 Love each other just as I have loved you.

168
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
 You should love each other.

169
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,360
 Your love for one another will prove to the world that you're my disciples."

170
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,880
 And the love should not stop with us because there are other people who need to see this

171
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,040
 love.

172
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,400
 God pours it into us so we can pour into other people.

173
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,740
 In Branches of Hope, we serve some people who don't know God.

174
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,680
 And the only way they will want to know God is when they see the love flowing from us

175
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,720
 to them.

176
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,160
 So with these four verses, we will go to an extended definition that I came up with.

177
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,880
 And the new definition for agape is, "It is an unconditional, sacrificial love that flows

178
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,640
 from God through the Holy Spirit and leads us to acts of selfless love for others."

179
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,140
 Essentially, it is what Andrew spoke about and described in the first week, being willing

180
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,600
 to disadvantage ourselves for the advantage of our community.

181
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,320
 I truly believe that if everybody gave what God asked us to give, there would be no lack

182
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,840
 in the church of God.

183
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,800
 There would be no lack in the kingdom of God.

184
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,440
 This is a beautiful picture of how God has equipped each and every one of us to meet

185
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
 each other's needs.

186
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,320
 It's like a God community where no one lacks anything, whether it is prayer, whether it

187
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:09,520
 is fellowship, whether it is resources or anything, because at any given time, we probably

188
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,760
 need one of those.

189
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,240
 And at any given time, we probably can give one of those.

190
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,080
 Allow me to share some of the acts of love that have been expressed to some of our clients

191
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,600
 through Branches of Hope recently.

192
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,120
 Our stop program recently helped a man called Saul, a father of three from Indonesia, who

193
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,880
 had sold his most prized possession, a rice field, to cover a broker's fee who had promised

194
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,680
 him a high-paying dishwashing job in Hong Kong.

195
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,080
 When he arrived in Hong Kong, his dreams were shattered when he discovered the job was a

196
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
 lie.

197
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,160
 His tourist visa expired, and his limited English made it difficult for him to navigate

198
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,120
 the immigration requirements to go back home.

199
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,240
 Thankfully, Stop's Indonesian caseworker, Dedi, accompanied him from the immigration

200
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
 office to the shelter and through the courtroom.

201
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,000
 Dedi interpreted and guided him through the complex administrative and legal processes.

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,960
 Saul was ultimately given a non-custodial sentence in order to return to Indonesia.

203
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,280
 Stop bought his ticket and helped him secure business startup funding from the International

204
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,280
 Organization for Migration.

205
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:30,800
 At the airport, Saul was overjoyed and grasped Dedi's hands tightly, his eyes shining with

206
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
 gratitude.

207
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:38,400
 The assistance Saul received not only sent him back home to safety, but it gave him a

208
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,320
 new lease of life.

209
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,920
 You might have also read the story of Lisa, an asylum seeker from Russia, in the Branches

210
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,480
 of Hope article published on World Refugee Day.

211
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,640
 Lisa is one of the 200,000 people in Hong Kong that Andrew spoke about last week who

212
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,120
 live in a 100-square-foot home.

213
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,360
 She lives with her son, James, in a subdivided flat in Hong Kong.

214
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,120
 As she waits for her case to go through the lengthy process, she cannot work and has to

215
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,960
 survive on the limited government allowance.

216
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,600
 Through the generous donation of someone through the Branches of Hope Star Program, which provides

217
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,600
 an allowance for utilities, we will hear more about it later, Lisa and James can now use

218
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,960
 their fan and have the lights on for longer.

219
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,120
 This has not only provided a more comfortable environment for them, you know the heat in

220
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,080
 Hong Kong, now they can turn their fan on.

221
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,960
 But it has given them a space for learning for James.

222
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:49,120
 So we're not only meeting the current needs, but we are speaking into destiny and the future.

223
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,840
 Through the Road and Star Programs, our clients, they feel seen by us.

224
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,960
 They feel heard, that somebody cares.

225
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,540
 They feel cared for.

226
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,460
 They feel comforted.

227
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,320
 They feel covered.

228
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,600
 They feel hopeful.

229
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,680
 And essentially, they feel loved.

230
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,760
 They feel agapid.

231
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:20,120
 They feel agapid by us, just like we want to feel agapid by the community around us.

232
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,720
 The impact of other people's giving to Lisa and Paul and Saul have far greater impact

233
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,960
 on their lives than the people giving no.

234
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,080
 They are giving more than money.

235
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,440
 They are letting them know that they're not alone.

236
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:42,080
 What may be a meal for us is destiny for someone else.

237
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,280
 Last week, Andrew gave us a model of engagement.

238
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,400
 And in that, he talked about Jesus weeping.

239
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,000
 And that was a key part for Jesus.

240
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,560
 He had to weep before he could speak.

241
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,600
 I believe for us, it's also very key for us to be able to really see and not just weep

242
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:08,080
 physically, but maybe weep emotionally, connecting to the situation, not just mentally connecting,

243
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:13,200
 empathetically connecting to the needs of the community around us.

244
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:19,600
 Today we're going to play a four-minute audio video in order for us to approach and really

245
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,360
 see.

246
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:28,440
 Just a warning, there are sounds of violence for those who are sensitive in this audio.

247
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:36,440
 But this is not a story told by pictures and words, but it is by the sounds one might encounter

248
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,800
 along the perilous journey to safety.

249
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,080
 We invite you to close your eyes or even look at the subtitles on the screens.

250
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:53,200
 Whatever you feel will make you immerse in the situation and the experience.

251
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,760
 And imagine yourself walking in their shoes.

252
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,080
 At the end of the audio, Alex, the executive director of Branches of Hope, will come on

253
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,280
 stage to lead us through a collective exercise to drive home just how odious this journey

254
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,200
 from struggle to hope is.

255
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,640
 So please have the resource packs placed on your seats ready, and let's listen together.

256
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,520
 >> Everyone, my name is Alex.

257
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,360
 I'm the executive director at Branches of Hope.

258
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,920
 How was that?

259
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:33,680
 I wonder if it was a way for you to approach this community a little bit more.

260
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,440
 The audio journey that we just heard is based on real stories that community members have

261
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
 told us over the years.

262
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,560
 And of course, it reflects primarily the experiences of refugees and asylum seekers, but those

263
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:53,360
 that we serve through the Stop Trafficking of Persons program are no less terrifying

264
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,360
 and traumatic.

265
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,600
 Even if your eyes are not filled with tears at this point, what we hope is that your hearts

266
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,400
 are ready to weep for the injustice that this experience symbolizes, and that we can collectively

267
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,800
 move from empathy towards compassion.

268
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,600
 As Taz mentioned, to do that, we're going to go through a little bit of an exercise

269
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
 together.

270
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,560
 All of you should have gotten a little bit of a card on your chairs when you came in.

271
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,100
 This is a resource card.

272
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,000
 And these resources reflect the resources that were needed along this audio journey

273
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,920
 that we just heard to get from one stage to the next.

274
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,600
 There's eight resources in total, but not everybody has all eight resources.

275
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,000
 And so to demonstrate ultimately how difficult this journey is, I'm going to ask all of you

276
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,280
 please to stand.

277
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,520
 Please stand with me.

278
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
 Don't be shy.

279
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,680
 We're all doing it together.

280
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,100
 And basically what I'm going to do now is I'm going to read out these resources one

281
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,540
 by one.

282
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,080
 And if you have that resource, well done, you get to keep standing.

283
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,960
 But if you don't have that resource, I'm going to ask you to sit down.

284
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,200
 So we're going to start off with the first one.

285
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,200
 If you remember in the story right after, you know, the interruption of violence, they

286
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,520
 had to pay a bus driver to get out of there.

287
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,440
 If you have on your resource card the money for the bus, you can stay standing.

288
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,320
 But if you don't, please sit down.

289
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,840
 Check your resource card.

290
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,040
 Oh, Pastor Stephen's out already.

291
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,760
 My goodness.

292
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,640
 Now, if you have on your resource card, if you have passports for yourself and your family,

293
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
 stay standing.

294
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,880
 But if you don't, sit down.

295
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,880
 If you have on your resource cards the savings to pay for flights, you may stay standing.

296
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,960
 But if not, please sit down.

297
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,780
 If you're one of the lucky people that on arrival to Hong Kong has a visa, you can stay

298
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,100
 standing.

299
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,400
 But if not, please sit down.

300
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,560
 If you are able to communicate in Hong Kong with English or Cantonese, you can stay standing.

301
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,520
 But if you don't, please sit down.

302
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,000
 You can see that slowly but surely we're all starting to sit down.

303
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,040
 If you have money for food and shelter, you can stay standing.

304
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:28,000
 But if you don't, please sit down.

305
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,920
 And if you have local connections and resources, you may remain standing.

306
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,440
 But if not, please sit down.

307
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,520
 At this point, there's only a handful of people remaining standing.

308
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,080
 And those who are standing should have all eight resources on their card, the final one

309
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,520
 being having your claim as an asylum seeker accepted and receiving refugee status and

310
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,800
 being resettled to a third country.

311
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,600
 If you can see around the room, the only ones who are left standing at this point, that's

312
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,400
 about 1% of the total auditorium capacity.

313
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,320
 99% of you are sitting down.

314
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,560
 99% of you have not actually made it to this point of protection.

315
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,040
 You have been thrust back into the turmoil that we heard.

316
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
 Thank you, you guys can sit down.

317
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,280
 Thank you so much.

318
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,320
 I think, honestly, this is what makes my heart reap the most.

319
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:29,560
 This idea of like being so close to ultimately safety and thriving your life and to just

320
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,560
 then being sent back.

321
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,760
 And the fact is that not only is it hard to get to Hong Kong, you need all of those resources

322
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,200
 to get here, and not everybody has those resources.

323
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,440
 But then in Hong Kong, less than 1%, over 99% of those who actually come to Hong Kong

324
00:22:48,440 --> 00:23:00,540
 ultimately fail in their seeking of protection and get sent back to their home countries.

325
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:06,000
 Like branches of hope, what we try to do is we try to come alongside the community and

326
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,800
 we try to cut through the noise and the anxiety of what we just heard and ultimately support

327
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,600
 them along their journey from struggle to hope.

328
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:21,240
 We provide them with the care and the empowerment that is necessary to lead them to better futures.

329
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,040
 Without organizations like ours, the time in Hong Kong would be much more difficult.

330
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:34,600
 A life caught in existential conundrums and the only room for personal growth being daily

331
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
 survival.

332
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,640
 That's it.

333
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,960
 And let's be brutally honest for a moment.

334
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,240
 For the majority of the people we serve, the vast majority of the people we serve, there

335
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,680
 are no straightforward solutions.

336
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,360
 It is a life in perpetual limbo.

337
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,080
 But this is why the work of branches of hope is a conscious and radical act of sacrificial

338
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,880
 love of agape, what Taz was mentioning and what Ed had referenced just earlier when he

339
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
 was sharing.

340
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,360
 Thank you so much, Ed, by the way.

341
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,200
 That we carry out every single day.

342
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,920
 I want to reflect on the powerful messages we've heard over the past three weeks about

343
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:19,400
 justice, compassion, righteousness, and the call to love one another.

344
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:25,240
 Each sermon has reminded us that our faith is not just a private matter, but a communal

345
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:32,320
 calling, a calling to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God.

346
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:39,440
 At branches of hope, we share that calling and we will continue to pour agape into others,

347
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,780
 God willing, as long as he pours love into us and into all of you.

348
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,780
 The communities we serve might not be our flesh and blood and they may certainly not

349
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,200
 be in a position to reciprocate in the season that they are in, but that's not the point.

350
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,240
 We can still and we must still love them regardless.

351
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,820
 We must show them more than just empathy.

352
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,880
 We must practice compassion.

353
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,300
 We must act.

354
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:13,760
 It is this conscious, radical, and continuous act of love of agape that is the linchpin

355
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,480
 connecting everything that we do at branches of hope with this day, once a year with all

356
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,440
 of you, to the message that Taz shared today, to Andrew's sermons before that, and to the

357
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,360
 whole social justice mission of Divine Church.

358
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,400
 If God has poured his love into you, I pray that nothing should restrict the onward flow

359
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,840
 of that love.

360
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,160
 And if I may dare be so bold, I pray that you direct some of that flow to helping us

361
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,080
 serve the communities God has put on our hearts.

362
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,160
 I pray that agape brings you to approach these communities, the refugees and asylum seekers,

363
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,960
 those who have experienced trafficking and labor exploitation, the vulnerable, the marginalized.

364
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,520
 And I pray that as you approach, you do not just see their needs, but your heart is broken

365
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,600
 for what breaks God's.

366
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:15,280
 And that this is what causes you to weep, not just for, but with our brothers and sisters.

367
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,760
 If these prayers are answered, if your agape overflows, and you approach, and you see,

368
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,160
 and you weep, and if it is genuine, I know in the depths of my heart that the only God-ordained

369
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,680
 outcome of this is that you will be compelled to speak and to help us speak for the communities

370
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,080
 we serve.

371
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,200
 That is the only logical conclusion.

372
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,520
 I'm asking you to pour out some of what God has poured into you, to support us in our

373
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,520
 conscious and radical act of love, and to help us speak for the communities we serve.

374
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,720
 Last year on Branches of Hope Sunday, your tithes and offerings provided the casework

375
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,880
 support for hundreds of people every single month.

376
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,520
 Your outpouring of love allowed us to run dozens of workshops for migrant workers.

377
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,520
 And your prayers have sustained us as a team and as individuals to keep doing the work

378
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,120
 that we do.

379
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,960
 Your generosity laid the foundations for the launch of our STAR program, which is a monthly

380
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,920
 financial assistance program providing rent and utility support to hundreds of people.

381
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,640
 Your support has also made it possible to weather fluctuations in donors.

382
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,820
 With your help, over the last few months, we have been serving over 240 people every

383
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,520
 single month with this assistance.

384
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,000
 And as amazing as that is, it only represents a third of all the people who have been asking

385
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,680
 and applying for this assistance.

386
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,640
 A third.

387
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:59,600
 Together, we can do more.

388
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,200
 With your support today, we hope to continue providing the casework support so essential

389
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,940
 to our communities, and we hope to increase the post-secondary education assistance to

390
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,360
 cover five students for their tertiary education.

391
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,400
 With the help of a new team member, we hope to revive our adult education and development

392
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,080
 services.

393
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,440
 And besides supporting us with your tithes today, you can also sign up to become a monthly

394
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,860
 donor, a monthly supporter at our booth outside.

395
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,200
 You can choose for whatever purpose you want to have your support going to, whether it

396
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,380
 is the STAR program, or whether it's our education programs, or even our general service fund.

397
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,720
 The bottom line, though, is that any regular amount will help us provide financial stability

398
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,680
 to hundreds of people.

399
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,000
 Let me give you an example.

400
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,960
 If just ten people from this service today make a commitment that every month you will

401
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,500
 donate $250, that's maybe two lunches worth.

402
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,980
 If you donate $250 every single month, ten of you, that would be enough money for us

403
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,760
 to be able to provide the STAR program assistance to five more people.

404
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,040
 If we have ten people from every service today to sign up to do that, we're supporting 15

405
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
 more people.

406
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,560
 It's that simple.

407
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,260
 And if you feel truly overwhelmed with compassion and the agape of God, then maybe the time

408
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,880
 has come for you to prayerfully consider a career with Branches of Hope.

409
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,520
 We always have opportunities and are looking for Christians to serve alongside us to do

410
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,500
 the work that we do.

411
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,880
 For all of these things, for all of the things that might catch your interest, please speak

412
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,000
 to my colleagues outside.

413
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,980
 They're very, very friendly and very happy to help you out.

414
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,720
 To those of you who have been walking so faithfully alongside us and the communities we serve

415
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,360
 all of these years, we cannot thank you enough.

416
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,220
 And to those of you who may only just be getting to know us or have not felt necessarily the

417
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,240
 call to support us yet, I pray that today is an encouragement to you to embrace our

418
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,120
 mission.

419
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,560
 I pray that the Holy Spirit moves among you to give and give generously out of compassion

420
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,980
 and conviction.

421
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,260
 May your love be like the water gushing from the rock in the desert.

422
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,400
 May God bless and multiply your offerings so that we may continue his work and together

423
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:27,380
 support the communities we serve in their journey from struggle to hope.

424
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:33,060
 Most importantly, though, I pray that these past three weeks have been a blessing to each

425
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:39,580
 and every one of you and that it has offered restoration in your relationships with God,

426
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,860
 your relationships with yourselves, your relationship with each other, and your relationship

427
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,300
 with creation.

428
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,740
 May we all continue to grow to be big people.

429
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
 Thank you.

430
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
 Wonderful.

431
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,540
 I wonder if you could all stand with me.

432
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:04,720
 And we're going to now move into a specific time together of agape-ing through our giving.

433
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,300
 And I want you to understand something really importantly right now.

434
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:13,740
 100% of what is given in our tithes and offerings across our service today, whatever is given

435
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,460
 in this moment across our services today, are going to Branches of Hope.

436
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,820
 So none of this is going to the vine.

437
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,620
 It's not going to our normal upkeep.

438
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,460
 100% of what you give right now is going to give immediately to Branches of Hope and the

439
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,800
 work that you've been hearing about today.

440
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:33,100
 So your tithes and offerings today are connecting directly with that need.

441
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,300
 In a moment, you'll have the opportunity to give like you would normally do.

442
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,620
 You'll have our hosts pass out the buckets amongst us.

443
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,860
 On your chair, there's the usual giving envelopes that you see every week.

444
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,580
 You can fill that in and whatever.

445
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,620
 Again, all of that money is going to go directly to Branches of Hope.

446
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,700
 Behind me in a moment, you'll see the digital ways to give like normal.

447
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,060
 100% of that goes to Branches of Hope.

448
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,260
 That's what we're going to do right now.

449
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,500
 This is a practical way for us to support this organization.

450
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,380
 Then after the service, you can by all means connect with them more, have a look at that

451
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,940
 merchandise, maybe sign up for that monthly support as well.

452
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,300
 I wonder whether we could do this in a place of an attitude of just the Spirit being amongst

453
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,100
 us, the joy of what it is to be a part of the gospel, to serve in this way.

454
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,740
 So would you just close your eyes with me and bow your head?

455
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:22,500
 Father, we are grateful that we are a worshiping community.

456
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,740
 By a worshiping community, we're not just singing songs to you.

457
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,780
 We're living lives that reveal the gospel to the world.

458
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,980
 We thank you for what Taz has beautifully shown us out of scripture today.

459
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,340
 That's agape love that is not a feeling but an action.

460
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:43,900
 We thank you that as we've heard from Alex, that there are very practical, direct needs

461
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,860
 that are within this community that our giving today is going to support.

462
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,580
 Lord, I want to pray now.

463
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,660
 I want you just to take a moment.

464
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,420
 This is the part of the services just between you and God.

465
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,740
 But just take a moment.

466
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:04,780
 Just ask the Holy Spirit to impress upon you how you are to react and act today.

467
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:10,940
 What is it that the Lord might be calling you to give as your tithes and offerings?

468
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,700
 And what is it that he might be asking you to do to continue to support the work of Branches

469
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,140
 of Hope in the months ahead?

470
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,220
 So we just invite you to come Holy Spirit.

471
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,660
 Come Holy Spirit.

472
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,260
 And we're going to do this act of offering through a moment of worship.

473
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,840
 Our band are just going to lead us in a time of worship and the hosts are going to hand

474
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,860
 out the buckets to you.

475
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,180
 Let's celebrate together as we give joyfully and cheerfully to the work of Branches of

476
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,420
 Hope.

477
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,000
 (gentle music)

478
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,580
 (gentle music)
