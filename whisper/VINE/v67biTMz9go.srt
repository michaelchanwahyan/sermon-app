1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 "And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,800
 The Lord shall return for my soul."

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,640
 Those lyrics that we just heard in that beautiful hymn

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,480
 that was originally written by Horatio Spafford

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,400
 and first published in 1876,

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,800
 carries with it so much of the central themes

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,680
 of this season of Advent

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,560
 that we're now celebrating here in 2024

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,240
 and that we began last week.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,800
 This idea that when the Lord returns,

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,200
 our faith shall be sight.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,280
 As we began our Advent series last week,

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,640
 I explained to us that historically,

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,640
 Advent is actually the celebration of two distinct events.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,880
 It's the celebration of the first Advent,

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,440
 the first arrival of Jesus as a child on Christmas day.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,240
 But Advent is also the celebration of the longing

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,200
 that we have for the return of Christ,

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,880
 to come back, not just to be born as a child,

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,280
 but to return at the end of all things

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,160
 as a conquering king

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,040
 and living on behalf of both of those realities today.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,560
 That's what Advent is.

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,240
 It's the great privilege and challenge that we have

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,320
 to live between what would be called

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,240
 the two bookends of redemptive history,

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,120
 of Jesus's story, both his birth and his return.

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,280
 We sit between those times

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,400
 and we have the great privilege

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,280
 and the glory of living the world

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,800
 and showing the world

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,600
 how these two events shape everything.

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,320
 Scholars call this time of living between the birth

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,320
 and the return of Jesus the now but not yet time.

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,240
 Now, in the sense that Christ has come at Christmas

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,600
 in that first original Advent,

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,800
 that he did inaugurate the kingdom,

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,840
 that he did go to the cross

39
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,680
 and paid the price for our sins,

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,600
 that he did rise from there three days later,

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,120
 that he did gather his disciples around him

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,240
 and give them the mission

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,520
 for commissioning the world into discipleship,

44
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,560
 that he did ascend to heaven

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
 and send his spirit to help us in our time here.

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,440
 All of that is now, that has happened,

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,440
 yet we're also living with this sense of not yet,

48
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,080
 that the reality is that sin is still an issue for us.

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,960
 Its victory has come completely on the cross

50
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,440
 and yet we still struggle with the influence

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,240
 and the impact of sin on our lives.

52
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,080
 We still see the impact of sin in the world

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,120
 and so the New Testament holds this tension

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,600
 between the reality that Christ has come

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,200
 and yet the need for him to return and return soon

56
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
 because when he comes back,

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,840
 as John sees this vision on the island of Patmos

58
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,600
 and God pulls the curtain back at the end of all things

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,640
 and goes in Revelation 21, 22,

60
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,080
 this is how it's all going to end.

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,680
 As we see that, we long for it

62
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,720
 because then the world will be completely as it should be.

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,320
 Now though, we're in the in-between

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
 and the New Testament is filled with passages

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
 about that in-between time.

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,000
 And last week, we took a look at Paul's famous passage

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,960
 in 1 Corinthians 13, not the love section,

68
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,200
 but the bit right after it

69
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,880
 where he basically says to his church,

70
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,400
 look, when we're living in this in-between time,

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,680
 we're living in a time where imperfection

72
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,120
 is the reality for us,

73
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,560
 but there is a time coming when perfection will return.

74
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,840
 And Paul says, it's like we don't know everything right now.

75
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,960
 In this now but not yet time, there are gaps

76
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,960
 in our knowledge, gaps in our experience.

77
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,320
 And we human beings, we don't like the gaps.

78
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,040
 When we have questions that go unanswered in our lives,

79
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,800
 when we have uncertainties that we sit in,

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,480
 human beings, we don't like that.

81
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,960
 And we wanna try and solve all of the mysteries.

82
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,880
 We wanna try and get all the answers.

83
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,160
 We really don't like being in the gaps.

84
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,720
 But Paul writes to the church and he says,

85
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,080
 you've gotta understand in this now but not yet time

86
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,920
 between the bookends of the birth and the return,

87
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,280
 there will be some gaps.

88
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,840
 There's a time coming where there will be no gaps.

89
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,280
 When perfection returns and we'll see everything

90
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,640
 and our faith as that lyric said, shall be made sight.

91
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,240
 But right now we sit in the in-between

92
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,200
 and there's a longing inside of us.

93
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,640
 That when we find ourselves in the gaps of life,

94
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,360
 we can have two choices.

95
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,840
 Either we are overwhelmed and succumbed by the gaps

96
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,800
 and they drain life from us,

97
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,440
 or perhaps the gaps are the great catalyst

98
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,400
 to our deepening relationship and trust

99
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,720
 in the one who has no gaps.

100
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,920
 And Paul says, here's the beautiful thing.

101
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,800
 That although we are in this now but not yet time

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,440
 and there's tension and there's gaps,

103
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,880
 God has not left us alone in the gaps.

104
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
 And he says right at the end of chapter 13,

105
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,080
 in one Corinthians, he says this.

106
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,320
 He says, now three things remain for us.

107
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,280
 Faith, hope, and love.

108
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
 And it's like Paul is saying,

109
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,320
 God has given us these vehicles,

110
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,840
 these catalysts within the gaps of this now but not yet time

111
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,360
 to help us to reconnect with him,

112
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,000
 to develop a deeper trust and hope in him

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
 that we would see the endable things

114
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,720
 and desire for it to come,

115
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,440
 that we would cry that prayer

116
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,920
 at the end of the New Testament,

117
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,160
 Maranatha, come Lord Jesus.

118
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,600
 'Cause we wanna see the world

119
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,160
 just as you have always created it to be.

120
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,600
 And so in our Advent series here at the Biome,

121
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,200
 we're taking faith, hope, and love this week

122
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,040
 and the next two.

123
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,880
 We're gonna unpack those for us.

124
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,600
 And today we're starting with the topic of faith.

125
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
 Now for me to try to cover the idea of faith

126
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,320
 in one message is too impossible.

127
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,600
 So what I wanna do is speak about faith with you today

128
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,560
 in the way that I think it's most relevant

129
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,600
 in this now but not yet tension of our Advent season

130
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,480
 between the birth and the return of Jesus.

131
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,920
 And to understand that,

132
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,400
 we have to first of all begin to grapple with the reality

133
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,840
 that the way that we think about faith today

134
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,680
 in the modern church is totally different

135
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
 to how the first Christians in the first century

136
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,200
 in the New Testament thought about faith.

137
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,760
 You see, here in the modern church,

138
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,640
 we think about faith like this.

139
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,640
 We essentially boil faith down to belief,

140
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,440
 to a set of beliefs that we have

141
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,960
 that creates a faith within us.

142
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,840
 And those beliefs are like doctrinal statements

143
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,920
 that we stand with and we honor and we agree to,

144
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,200
 and that means I have the Christian faith.

145
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,640
 I can call myself a Christian if I believe certain things.

146
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,720
 So when we say to somebody, I have faith in Jesus,

147
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,880
 what we're really saying in the modern context

148
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,400
 is I believe in the story of Jesus.

149
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,080
 I believe that he inaugurated the kingdom.

150
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,480
 I believe he came at Christmas.

151
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,760
 I believe that he went to the cross

152
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
 and paid the price of my sins.

153
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,480
 I believe he rose after three days.

154
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,240
 I believe that we have the spirit now in us,

155
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,360
 the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead

156
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,200
 now lives in me.

157
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,120
 I believe all those things.

158
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
 And so therefore, I can call myself a Christian

159
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
 and I say I have faith, belief in Jesus.

160
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
 Does that make sense to you?

161
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,040
 So that's how we think about it

162
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,320
 and we use that phrase all the time.

163
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,520
 You can go onto the Vine website

164
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,080
 and we have a statement of faith.

165
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,600
 Well, that basically is a statement of beliefs

166
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,360
 that we hold to as a church community

167
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
 that we encourage you also to embrace

168
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,120
 as you fellowship and worship along with us.

169
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,880
 So we use this idea in the modern church of faith

170
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,040
 being connected primarily to belief,

171
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,760
 our way of thinking, doctrinal statements that we adhere to,

172
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,720
 but that is not how it was used in the New Testament.

173
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,360
 'Cause you need to put yourself in the sandals,

174
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,080
 if you will, of the first century Christians.

175
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,440
 They're trying to evangelize, bring the gospel

176
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,600
 to a Greco-Roman culture and world.

177
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,880
 And within the Roman world, there was a pantheon of gods,

178
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,920
 many, many different kinds of gods.

179
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
 And because in the Roman world,

180
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,520
 there was such a pantheon of gods,

181
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,160
 if you were a good Roman citizen,

182
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,320
 you believed in all of these gods.

183
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
 Now, just believing in them

184
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,200
 didn't mean you were worshiping them all.

185
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,960
 In fact, it was impossible for you

186
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,600
 to worship all of these gods,

187
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,400
 but you believed in them

188
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,560
 alongside of your fellow faithful Greek people

189
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,760
 because that was the understanding and the culture.

190
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,360
 Now, what the first century Christians realized is,

191
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,640
 if they just said to a Roman person,

192
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,840
 "Hey, we want you to believe in Jesus,"

193
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,720
 their response would be, "Sure, happy to believe in Jesus.

194
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
 "I can just add Jesus onto the shelf

195
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,760
 "with all the other gods that I believe in.

196
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,040
 "We can just put Jesus into the pantheon of gods,

197
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,480
 "and that's all fine.

198
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,520
 "Believing in Jesus doesn't mean

199
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,160
 "I actually have to worship him."

200
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,640
 Are you following this?

201
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,520
 So when the first century church

202
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,680
 was trying to talk about what it meant to say,

203
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,480
 Jesus is Lord,

204
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,040
 they needed to find a word

205
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,000
 that defined for them more than just belief.

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,560
 Because if it was just about belief,

207
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,160
 the Romans would just add Jesus to the pantheon.

208
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,560
 They wanted the Romans to get rid of the pantheon

209
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,080
 and follow after Jesus and Jesus alone.

210
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,920
 They knew that Jesus was the only God,

211
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,320
 that he was the only God to worship.

212
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,840
 And then when you brought Jesus into your life,

213
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,360
 it meant a complete radical transformation of self.

214
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,120
 It meant that nothing else mattered after that point.

215
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,600
 It meant that there was no other God

216
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,560
 that was to be worshiped,

217
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,400
 that Jesus demanded everything that I had,

218
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,120
 that I would have to pick up my cross and follow him.

219
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,200
 I would need to give away all the other pantheon of gods

220
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,480
 and say, "This is the one true God."

221
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
 So they were like,

222
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,600
 "What word can we use from the Greek culture

223
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,160
 "that will help them to understand

224
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
 "that we're calling them for a radical change in their life?"

225
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
 So here's what they did.

226
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,520
 They chose the Greek word, "Pistes."

227
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,560
 And Pistes was used in Greek culture of those days

228
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,120
 to mean trust,

229
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,200
 particularly trustworthiness in relational context,

230
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,400
 or actually it carried with it the sense of commitment,

231
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,200
 committed, loyal, trusting relationship.

232
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,800
 Even when things get hard, I'm committed, I'm trusting,

233
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,520
 I'm in relationship with this thing,

234
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,840
 and I will carry that on forever.

235
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,360
 So the word Pistes was used in Greek culture

236
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,680
 to speak of this undying, connected trust

237
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,560
 to another in relationship with them

238
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,240
 that everything else has to submit to it.

239
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,360
 And they took that word and they said,

240
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,680
 "This is what it means to believe in Jesus."

241
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,040
 It's like you're having this Pistes relationship with him.

242
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,840
 Everything else needs to fall away.

243
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,280
 He's the only one you should trust.

244
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,840
 Does that make sense?

245
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,280
 Now, can you guess

246
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,040
 in your English language versions of the Bible

247
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,400
 what English word is used to translate

248
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,440
 the Greek word Pistes?

249
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,720
 You guessed it, it's the word faith.

250
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,520
 Now, this is really important that you understand this

251
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,640
 because when you read the word faith in the New Testament,

252
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,840
 it's not just talking about some set idea of beliefs,

253
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,160
 it's actually talking about the complete giving away

254
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,840
 of your life in fullness and trust

255
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,760
 to this relationship you have with Jesus.

256
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,800
 So every time the faith comes up

257
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
 in your English language Bible,

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
 it's actually talking about,

259
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,000
 are you trusting your whole life in relationship to this

260
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,840
 or are you putting your trust in other places?

261
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,640
 It was a call to complete surrender

262
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,600
 and this was the word that they used

263
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,640
 as they shared the hope of Jesus in the world.

264
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,760
 Now, here's why it's important that I tell you that.

265
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,880
 Because one of the things I want you to start doing

266
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,240
 is you read the New Testament

267
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,480
 and you see the word faith in Jesus or faith pop up,

268
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
 you should begin to translate that

269
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,120
 as this is calling me to trust the Lord more,

270
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,600
 not believe certain things.

271
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
 Are you with me?

272
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,920
 It's not a stopping at,

273
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,440
 I'm just gonna have some intellectual understanding

274
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,120
 of something, this is actually

275
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,520
 about the radical transformation of my life.

276
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,600
 Helpful?

277
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,080
 Okay, now, the New Testament is filled with moments

278
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,400
 where it speaks of this radical kind of call

279
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,640
 to trusting in God beyond everything.

280
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,480
 But I wanna take you to perhaps

281
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,080
 what is the most famous of these,

282
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,360
 the one that I think actually speaks the most

283
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,400
 to this now but not yet time of advent

284
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,360
 that we're in right now.

285
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,160
 And this is found in Hebrews chapter 11,

286
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,600
 starting in verse one.

287
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,080
 Now, listen to this, this is what the writer says.

288
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,080
 He says, "Now, faith is confidence in what we hope for

289
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,680
 and the assurance about what we do not see.

290
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,400
 This is what the ancients were commended for."

291
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,680
 So by faith, we understand that the universe

292
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,680
 was formed at God's command so that it was seen

293
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,320
 or what was seen was not made out of what was visible.

294
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,280
 By faith, Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did.

295
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,880
 By faith, he was commended as a righteous man

296
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,360
 when God spoke well of his offerings.

297
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,920
 And by faith, he still speaks even though he is dead.

298
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,720
 By faith, Enoch was taken from this life

299
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,560
 so that he did not experience death.

300
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,560
 He could not be found because God had taken him away.

301
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,120
 For before he was taken,

302
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,080
 he was commended as one who pleased God.

303
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,520
 And without faith, it is impossible to please God.

304
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,680
 Ho, ho, ho, I wanna preach on this one from it.

305
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,840
 Are you okay?

306
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,040
 Notice this again.

307
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,800
 Without faith, it is impossible to please God.

308
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,480
 I don't know about you, I don't know if you've ever

309
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,800
 taken some time to actually deeply reflect

310
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,800
 around what the writer in Hebrews here

311
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
 is actually trying to communicate.

312
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,720
 Without faith, it is impossible to please God.

313
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,520
 I don't know about you, but that sort of feels to me

314
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,360
 a little bit like an unfair obligation on humans.

315
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,400
 I don't know if you've ever tried to please God.

316
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,440
 Have you ever tried to please God?

317
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
 Just me?

318
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,520
 We all try to please God, don't we, all the time.

319
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,280
 Or maybe for like one day, you're like,

320
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,720
 if I could only just please God a little bit more,

321
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,640
 if I can only get God's a little bit more favor on my side,

322
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,880
 more of his blessings, then everything will go well.

323
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,680
 So today, I'm just gonna try to be a nicer person.

324
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,480
 I'm gonna try to be a little bit better.

325
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,600
 I'm gonna try to like get my life in order.

326
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,360
 I'm gonna confess all my sins.

327
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,720
 I'm gonna do all of this stuff to try to get God

328
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,880
 to be pleased with me so that his grace would be on me more,

329
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,160
 so that his blessings would be,

330
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,200
 and we work really hard as human beings sometimes

331
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,280
 to try to do all of this activity

332
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,160
 in order for God to be pleased.

333
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,040
 And the writer here says, it is impossible

334
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,640
 to please God without faith.

335
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,400
 So you can do all of these activities,

336
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,840
 all of these things that you're thinking

337
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,440
 is winning God's favor, and none of it is gonna please him

338
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,960
 if you do it without faith.

339
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,160
 Faith is the changing thing,

340
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,040
 the thing that changes everything in the conversation.

341
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,520
 The passage here does not say, hey, if you try hard enough,

342
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,920
 he will be pleased with you.

343
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,920
 It doesn't say here, hey, if you're good enough,

344
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,640
 he's gonna be pleased with you.

345
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,920
 It doesn't say if you're successful enough,

346
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,000
 he's gonna be pleased with you.

347
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,360
 It literally says without faith, you cannot please God.

348
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,280
 The only thing that we have that brings pleasure

349
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,560
 in God's eyes, that grants this great pleasure to him

350
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,000
 is when we exercise faith.

351
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,880
 Now here's the other interesting thing about this.

352
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,320
 I wonder if you've thought of it this way.

353
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,320
 We are the only species in the whole of God's creation

354
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,000
 who is called to do this.

355
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,960
 In other words, everything else is not called to do that.

356
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,480
 So for example, a dog is not called to live by faith.

357
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,240
 Possums are not called to live by faith.

358
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
 Trees are not called to live by faith.

359
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,880
 The only creation that God has made

360
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,920
 that is called to live by faith is us, is humans.

361
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,280
 We are the only ones who are held to that kind of standard.

362
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
 Now why is that important?

363
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,920
 Because really, if you follow the logic

364
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,720
 of what the writer's trying to communicate here,

365
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,800
 here's what he's saying.

366
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,440
 Faith, which is this exercise of our trust in God,

367
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,040
 is the one activity we do that makes us truly human.

368
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,320
 It's the one thing we do that actually separates us

369
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,920
 from the animal kingdom around us,

370
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,040
 which is really challenging if you flip it the other way

371
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,240
 and think of it like this.

372
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,920
 If you live without faith, you are just an animal.

373
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,120
 No, no, that's not a joke.

374
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,120
 I'm preaching to you what God is communicating here to us,

375
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,880
 that our exercise of faith is the one thing

376
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,560
 that actually makes us truly human.

377
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,280
 And if we live without faith,

378
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,480
 then we are no better than the animal kingdom around us.

379
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,640
 You know, a dog pleases the Lord

380
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,120
 simply by just being a dog, a possum,

381
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,440
 just by being a possum, a tree,

382
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,560
 by the glorious fact that it is just a tree.

383
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,120
 They just have to exist to please God,

384
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,360
 but us, we have to exercise trust in Him.

385
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,680
 And as we do that, we find ourselves

386
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,200
 being more the way we were ever created to be.

387
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,880
 We were literally designed and created

388
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,520
 to honor the Lord with faith, to live a life of faith.

389
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
 And when we live without faith,

390
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,160
 we are actually living far beyond and below

391
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,520
 the standard of our human potential.

392
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,760
 Faith is this incredible thing

393
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,000
 that helps us to exercise exactly who it is

394
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,520
 that we've been made to be.

395
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,040
 It separates us from the rest of God's creation,

396
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,280
 and it plants our feet firmly in this idea

397
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,880
 that we are human, which is really interesting.

398
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,640
 Because so often as human beings,

399
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,320
 when it comes to faith, here's what we think.

400
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,120
 We think faith makes somebody superhuman.

401
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,120
 Oh, Pastor Andrew, he has such great faith.

402
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,320
 Oh, I wish I was like Pastor Andrew.

403
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,480
 Oh, if only I could be a little bit more like Pastor Andrew,

404
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,080
 I would also have great faith,

405
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,440
 and I would be a better person,

406
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,640
 and I would live a better life.

407
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,680
 And we kind of put people up on a pedestal,

408
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,240
 and we say, these people have super faith,

409
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,840
 and we wanna try and be like these superhumans

410
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,000
 who give faith.

411
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
 But the writer in Hebrews here

412
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,320
 is saying the opposite of this.

413
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,640
 He's saying, look, faith doesn't make you superhuman.

414
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,960
 Faith makes you simply human.

415
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,920
 Come on, church.

416
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,560
 It doesn't make you superhuman.

417
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,760
 It doesn't put a cape on your back with a big S on it.

418
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,920
 It just makes you the way you were designed to be,

419
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,520
 'cause you are not a dog, you are not a possum.

420
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,680
 You are a human being.

421
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,920
 Therefore, please him with faith.

422
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,480
 And if you live without faith, then you're no better

423
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,400
 than any of these other creative things around you.

424
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
 You're not actually being human.

425
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,600
 So it's like the writer here is actually inviting humanity

426
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,320
 into the glory of being just as God had created them to be.

427
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,160
 And this is important, 'cause he's saying

428
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,600
 we have to separate ourselves from all other creation,

429
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,720
 and the way we do that is we please God by giving faith,

430
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,440
 which means we should ask the question,

431
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,520
 what does faith look like?

432
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,320
 How do we do that then?

433
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,160
 Because I wanna be human.

434
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,240
 I don't know about you, but I do not wanna be a dog.

435
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
 (congregation laughing)

436
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,960
 I wanna be a human being,

437
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,720
 and I wanna live for the glory of God,

438
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,120
 and I want my life to please him.

439
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,480
 And if we cannot please God without faith,

440
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,360
 then my question is, how do we live with faith?

441
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,040
 So good that the phone went right at the end of that.

442
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,880
 You hear that?

443
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,120
 How do we live without faith?

444
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,040
 (imitates phone ringing)

445
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,880
 That's God's message to you.

446
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,080
 (congregation laughing)

447
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,480
 (imitates phone ringing)

448
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
 Turn your phones off in Jesus' name, I love you.

449
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,000
 All right.

450
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 (congregation laughing)

451
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,120
 How do we do this?

452
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,800
 Well, now that we've unpacked the very end

453
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,560
 of the passage I read, and we understand this call

454
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,320
 to be separated from everything around us

455
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,520
 and be truly human, let's now go back and see how it's done.

456
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,840
 Notice what it says in verse one.

457
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,240
 "Now faith is the confidence in what we hope for."

458
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,560
 Hang on, okay, let's just stop there.

459
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,440
 Let's just stop there for a moment.

460
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,800
 "Faith is the confidence in what we hope for."

461
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,160
 I don't know about you, but that is not gonna work for me.

462
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,800
 That is not gonna work for me because I don't know

463
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,340
 if that is how I'm living my life.

464
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,040
 In fact, I can tell you that's usually not the way

465
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,880
 I live my life.

466
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,240
 Faith is the confidence in what we hope for.

467
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,360
 Hope seems so out there, doesn't it?

468
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,200
 It seems so nebulous.

469
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,280
 It doesn't feel rooted in anything.

470
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,400
 It feels like it's some future thing

471
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,680
 that we can't tangibly grasp.

472
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,740
 No, you wanna know what we find our confidence in?

473
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,440
 As human beings, it's not some nebulous little hope

474
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,920
 that's kind of out there somewhere.

475
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,480
 What we find confidence is what we have right here and now.

476
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,240
 We root our confidence in what we have, don't we?

477
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,320
 So much of our lives is based off the confidence

478
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,720
 of what we have, not the confidence of what we hope for.

479
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,660
 We actually have more confidence in our bank accounts

480
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,360
 than we do in the promises of God.

481
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,480
 Oh, you don't want me to preach this.

482
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,560
 I'm gonna preach this one.

483
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,180
 We have more confidence in our bank accounts

484
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,320
 than we do in taking a risk in Jesus.

485
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,040
 We have more confidence in our workplaces

486
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,000
 and the job that we do that puts a roof over our head

487
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,560
 than we do in trusting Him.

488
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,240
 We have more confidence in our own skill sets

489
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,320
 and what we are and our gifts and our talents

490
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,080
 than we do in relying on Him

491
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,960
 and the work of His Spirit in this life.

492
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,280
 And so when the Bible says,

493
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,000
 "Here's faith, have confidence in what you hope for,"

494
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,040
 we say, "No."

495
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,080
 No, I'm rooted and I'm grounded in what I have

496
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,600
 and what I have gives me confidence.

497
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,900
 Only me that does this.

498
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,320
 Anyone else here do that?

499
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,420
 We root ourselves, don't we, in what we have

500
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,740
 and that's where we draw our confidence

501
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,440
 and the writer here is saying, "You've got it wrong.

502
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,640
 "It's got to be in what you hope for."

503
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,480
 Why?

504
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,880
 Because there is such a big difference

505
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,240
 between what you have and what you hope for.

506
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,200
 See, what you have is your possessions.

507
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,880
 What you hope for is your expectations.

508
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,860
 What you have is past and present.

509
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,060
 This is very important.

510
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,700
 What you hope for is future.

511
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,260
 Put it in the language of this series.

512
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,980
 What you have is now, what you hope for is not yet.

513
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,620
 And here's what the writer's saying.

514
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,700
 If all you do is live without faith,

515
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,100
 then you are rooting yourself

516
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,620
 in the past and the present only.

517
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,140
 Come on, church, follow the logic.

518
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,940
 He's saying, if you live without faith,

519
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,300
 if faith literally is designed to be this hoping

520
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,660
 for what we don't currently have

521
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,140
 and all you do is live without faith,

522
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,580
 that means you're only living for what you do have.

523
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,420
 That's something that you've received in the past

524
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,740
 or something you're possessing in the present.

525
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,780
 You're trapped in the past and the present,

526
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,060
 but human beings were made for the future.

527
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,140
 Human beings were not made to just honor

528
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,500
 and understand the past and the present.

529
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,340
 We were made to move the world

530
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,020
 with the work of the spirit towards its good future.

531
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,420
 And so the writer here is attacking this sort of idea

532
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,740
 that, hey, if you're without faith, it's just about now,

533
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,660
 which we saw last week when Paul writes

534
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,940
 about the now but not yet.

535
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,380
 What does he say about the now?

536
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,140
 He says the now is a hard place to be

537
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,500
 'cause we've got these big gaps

538
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,140
 and we don't have all the answers

539
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,700
 and we don't know everything.

540
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,940
 And it's like looking in a mirror dimly

541
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,700
 and the now here overwhelms us.

542
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,900
 And when it overwhelms us, we try to control.

543
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,660
 And when we try to control, we make things even worse.

544
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,260
 And this is why he then writes and says,

545
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,620
 you wanna know what the way to live really is?

546
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,260
 It's not to live trapped in the past or the present.

547
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,300
 In the now, the way to live as a human being

548
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
 created in the image of God

549
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,660
 is to put your confidence in what you hope for.

550
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,540
 It's to begin to stretch beyond into the future

551
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,980
 and believe that that is where the promises of God are

552
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,820
 and God will bring those promises.

553
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,460
 Oh, I have confidence in what I hope for.

554
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,340
 I'm not tethered here to what is just now.

555
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,380
 This is Paul saying, this is why God gives us faith.

556
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,060
 See, if God just wanted you rooted

557
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,700
 in the past and the present,

558
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,340
 he wouldn't have given you faith

559
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,620
 in this now but not yet time.

560
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,460
 Instead, to help you in those gaps,

561
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,820
 faith comes to lift you out of the present and the past

562
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,780
 and bring you towards the hope of his return.

563
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,740
 Oh, haste the day when you return

564
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,340
 when my faith will become sight.

565
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,740
 That what I believe right now,

566
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,020
 I will see in its fullness then.

567
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,140
 That's my longing.

568
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,500
 See, this is the great message of Advent.

569
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,060
 The great message of Advent

570
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:04,260
 is that this idea of peace comes upon us

571
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,220
 when we're not kind of looking for what we have right now

572
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,020
 but we're longing for what we hope for in the future.

573
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,620
 And here's the thing, if you do not have confidence

574
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,580
 in what you hope for in the future,

575
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,700
 you will hold on far too tightly

576
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,300
 to what you have in the present.

577
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,300
 Come on, church, I'm gonna say that again.

578
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,980
 If you do not have confidence

579
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,540
 in what you hope for in the future,

580
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,700
 that will force you to hold on way too tightly

581
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,780
 to what you have in the past and in the present.

582
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,260
 And all those things that the Holy Spirit

583
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,060
 actually wants to release from you,

584
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,740
 all those things that tether you

585
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,620
 to the pain of your past or the struggles of your present,

586
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,820
 he wants to release you to that.

587
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,900
 But if your confidence is there and not there,

588
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,100
 you're gonna be tethered here.

589
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,220
 Are you following what the writer's saying?

590
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,420
 Now, this is really important

591
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,660
 because this is an invitation

592
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,300
 to greater freedom in your life.

593
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,900
 And some of you need to understand this.

594
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,060
 This is so important.

595
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,820
 When you live without faith,

596
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,340
 you will live tethered to the past and the present.

597
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,020
 And that will shape how you think about life.

598
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,900
 And here's the thing,

599
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,060
 if that is shaping how you think about life,

600
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,820
 you are living more with fate than faith.

601
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,180
 I wanna unpack this one for you for a moment.

602
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,740
 See, I'm convinced that the majority of Christians

603
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,220
 actually think they're living faithfully,

604
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,700
 but they're actually living faithfully.

605
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,300
 You see, the Bible is saying, here's how to live.

606
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,100
 Have greater confidence in what you hope for

607
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,180
 than what you have.

608
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,260
 But the reality is for all of us, I would say,

609
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,380
 we actually root ourselves in what we have

610
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,180
 more than what we hope for.

611
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,420
 And therefore, we're allowing what has happened already

612
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,740
 to determine what's gonna happen ahead.

613
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,060
 That's fate.

614
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,740
 Fate is the predetermined understanding

615
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,900
 of everything in the world that has happened

616
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,140
 and that I'm caught up in an unchangeable sequence of events

617
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,300
 because of what's happened and what is happening.

618
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,460
 That's fate.

619
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,380
 And this is the great challenge to us.

620
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,420
 As Christians, we might think we're being faithful,

621
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,020
 but we're actually being faithful.

622
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,260
 We're actually logging ourselves in that

623
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,820
 than the hope of what is to come.

624
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,940
 And this is the great invitation.

625
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,740
 Lift yourself out from a fate way of thinking

626
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,580
 to a faith way of thinking.

627
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,020
 To do that, just be confident in what it is

628
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,660
 that you hope for.

629
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,620
 Question is, you should wrestle with this one this week.

630
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,900
 What is it that you're hoping for?

631
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,940
 And what is it that you're hoping for

632
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,660
 that has a confidence in your heart

633
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,380
 that's far greater than what you currently already possess?

634
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,980
 If you can make that shift,

635
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,460
 you will move from fate to faith.

636
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,700
 And let me just say this one more time.

637
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,100
 If you are living with fate,

638
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,180
 you are no better than an animal

639
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,740
 because that's what animals do.

640
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,940
 That's how they live.

641
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,460
 That's how they function.

642
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,260
 They're fate-based.

643
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,140
 They are doing it out of the response

644
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,460
 of the past and the present.

645
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,620
 We humans are arranged and designed to live differently.

646
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,580
 And the question is, will we live differently?

647
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,820
 Are you tracking with this still?

648
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,580
 Now, notice what happens in the second half of this.

649
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,020
 This blows my mind even more.

650
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,660
 It says this, so now faith is the confidence

651
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,380
 in what we hope for and the assurance

652
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,740
 of what is not yet seen.

653
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,460
 This one's also not gonna work for me, by the way.

654
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,780
 The assurance of what we do not yet see,

655
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,540
 that doesn't make any sense

656
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,700
 because surely my whole life is kind of based

657
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,580
 off of what I can see.

658
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,980
 Surely the assurance I have is in how I see things

659
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,660
 in my life and the things that I can tangibly see around me.

660
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,260
 In fact, humans actually define success

661
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,940
 based on what they see.

662
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,660
 This, my friends, is why social media exists.

663
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,260
 It's why we have Instagram.

664
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,940
 I'm on Instagram, so just, you know,

665
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,660
 you can follow me if you want, but anyway.

666
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,780
 (audience laughing)

667
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,060
 But Instagram is essentially me saying,

668
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,620
 I wanna show you a side of who I am.

669
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
 I wanna show you how successful I am.

670
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,060
 I wanna show you the best moments of my life

671
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,260
 because we judge based on what we currently see, don't we?

672
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,980
 Like, that's just the natural way that we do this,

673
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,020
 and the writer here says, if you only live a life

674
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,260
 where you're basing it on what you currently see,

675
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,500
 then again, you're not actually being human.

676
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,460
 Follow the logic once again

677
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,940
 because our faith, which makes us able to please God

678
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,060
 in our humanity, is based on the assurance

679
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,900
 of what we do not yet see.

680
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,540
 So in other words, Christians should go out into the world

681
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,700
 and they should see the world differently

682
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,700
 from everybody else, but I think we struggle with this.

683
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,420
 I don't think this comes naturally to us,

684
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,740
 and I think we have to think deeply about this

685
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,180
 'cause I don't know about you,

686
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,060
 but if you start looking at the world,

687
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,460
 it's pretty depressing on the whole.

688
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,620
 I mean, there's a lot of pain out there.

689
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,420
 There's a lot of brokenness.

690
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,820
 There's a lot of sin.

691
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,260
 There's a lot of betrayal.

692
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,700
 There's a lot of death and war and violence and suffering.

693
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,060
 And if we were to look at the world

694
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,700
 purely at what we currently see,

695
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,220
 I think we would be the most depressed people

696
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,460
 that we could possibly be.

697
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,460
 We as Christians are called to faith,

698
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,380
 which means that when we see the world,

699
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,340
 we don't ignore the challenges and the difficulties,

700
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,620
 but we should see beyond what we see in the physical

701
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,900
 and we should begin to see with eyes of faith.

702
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,700
 We should begin to see what God is doing in the spiritual

703
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,180
 'cause you know that there's two realms

704
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,940
 happening all the time, amen?

705
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,100
 There's the physical reality of what we see,

706
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,100
 but there's the spiritual realm of what God is doing.

707
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,780
 And so often God is calling forth the things

708
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,820
 that are not as if they were.

709
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,740
 And this is interesting 'cause we Christians

710
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,940
 should embrace this, but we so often don't.

711
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,980
 In fact, when we see the world,

712
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,380
 when we see people, we so often call out what we see

713
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,140
 and we wag a finger and we judge and we pull down

714
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,140
 and we criticize and we gossip and we do all the things

715
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,700
 that the world does and nothing separates us.

716
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,860
 But we should see the brokenness in this world,

717
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,180
 the injustice and the poverty and the suffering

718
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,780
 and the cruelty, and we should see beyond it

719
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,020
 to how God sees it.

720
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,900
 We should get a compassion for it.

721
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,660
 We should weep on its behalf and we should rise up in faith

722
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,620
 and wanna do something about it.

723
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,740
 We should be the ones that see the world

724
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,540
 in a different way.

725
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,540
 We should as Christians look upon say a drug addict

726
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,700
 and we should see yes, the ravages of the chemicals

727
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,980
 that are hurting that person and what they're doing

728
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,060
 and the addictive behavior and lifestyle that's coming for.

729
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,420
 We shouldn't ignore the reality of what we see,

730
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,940
 but when we see a drug addict as a Christian,

731
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,580
 you should see that reality,

732
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,060
 but then you should also begin to see,

733
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,020
 oh man, I can see this man,

734
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,620
 how he would be if he was restored back to health,

735
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,140
 how if Christ came into his life and began to minister to him

736
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,500
 how he began to get the help and the freedom he needs.

737
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500
 I can see this person back in a community thriving again

738
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,180
 with a job, looking healthy.

739
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,180
 I can see this person's life turn around.

740
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,860
 I refuse to settle with what my eyes tell me.

741
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,100
 I will look with what my spirit tells me

742
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,860
 and this one can be alive.

743
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,500
 We might look at a friend who's depressed right now

744
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,940
 and struggling with mental health issues

745
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,660
 and perhaps they were a great friend of ours

746
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,140
 and we had done a lot with them,

747
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,500
 but they've gotten kind of weird

748
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,260
 and it's not nice to be around them anymore

749
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,380
 and we're struggling with that

750
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,940
 and we're not hanging out with them as much

751
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,860
 and we're not even sure

752
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,540
 if we're really that good friends or not

753
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,180
 and if we only see with what our eyes tell us to see,

754
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,900
 if we live without faith,

755
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,380
 we're just gonna label them

756
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,500
 as somebody who's just got some mental health challenges,

757
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,540
 we're gonna leave them alone,

758
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,260
 but imagine if you had faith,

759
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,820
 the assurance of what you do not see

760
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,860
 and you look upon them

761
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,020
 and again, you see what's going on in their lives,

762
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,060
 you don't downplay it, you don't ignore it,

763
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,300
 the reality of the depression that's upon them,

764
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,180
 but you begin to see them free from that depression.

765
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,500
 You begin to see that the spirit of God could move

766
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,620
 and do something in their lives.

767
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,340
 You believe that there is some therapy

768
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,140
 and some help that could come alongside of them

769
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,900
 and revitalize who they are

770
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,180
 and you can see them again,

771
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,540
 healthy and full and flourishing

772
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,020
 and so when you look at them,

773
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,940
 you do not look without faith

774
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,460
 because if all you ever see is what is presented before you,

775
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,820
 how are you ever gonna be an agent of change

776
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,020
 for Christ in the world?

777
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,180
 Come on church.

778
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:34,420
 The advent is this invitation to us

779
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,420
 to find ourselves being truly human again.

780
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,900
 To say that it's not easy to live

781
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,180
 between the birth and the return of Christ,

782
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,060
 but we are not left alone in the gaps

783
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,180
 that we all feel that no, there is faith.

784
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,500
 This faith that pleases God,

785
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,980
 that separates us from the animal world around us

786
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,540
 and makes us truly as we were created to be

787
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,220
 and this faith is the confidence in what I'm hoping for.

788
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,500
 It is the assurance about what I currently do not see

789
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,860
 and I wanna live that kind of life

790
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,300
 because I believe that life changes the world.

791
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,340
 It's this kind of faith

792
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,780
 and actually the lack of it as well

793
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,660
 that you see throughout the Christmas story.

794
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,820
 I wonder if you've ever thought

795
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,140
 about the Christmas story in this way.

796
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,820
 Zachariah is a great example to us

797
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,940
 at the beginning of the Christmas story

798
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,980
 of one who did not have this kind of faith

799
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,900
 and when angel Gabriel showed up in the temple

800
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,660
 and said, Elizabeth is pregnant, she's gonna have a child,

801
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,660
 his immediate response is basically,

802
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,220
 I have confidence in what I have

803
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,140
 and I only see with my eyes what I see

804
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,020
 and what I have right now is old age and an old wife.

805
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,820
 What I see is years and years and years of infertility.

806
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,460
 I don't believe you

807
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,540
 and God brings a judgment on Zachariah

808
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,260
 because of that, he goes mute for the rest of the story

809
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,860
 until she gives birth but Elizabeth, this is interesting,

810
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,420
 where Zachariah struggles with that kind of faith,

811
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,100
 Elizabeth has it.

812
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,460
 So when she hears the news that this is going to happen,

813
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,820
 she immediately turns to God and she says,

814
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,740
 it is going to happen the way you had it

815
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,220
 and she said, it's because you are pleased with me

816
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,660
 which is an interesting play on this idea of faith

817
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,220
 enables us to please God

818
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,140
 but our faith makes him pleased with us.

819
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:24,100
 Mary, when Gabriel shows up to her and says,

820
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,940
 okay, I know that you're an unmarried teenager

821
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,700
 but you're about to have a baby,

822
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,620
 she's like, now, if that had been me,

823
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,540
 I would have had confidence in what I have

824
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,780
 and I would see what it is that I see

825
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,540
 and I'd be like, I haven't had sex, I'm a virgin.

826
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,540
 This is never gonna happen, this is not gonna happen,

827
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,740
 this is not gonna go the way it is, I don't believe it

828
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,140
 and instead, her response is this beautiful response,

829
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,940
 one of the most beautiful things that is said,

830
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,580
 one of the most greatest statements of faith

831
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,500
 we have in all the scripture, she simply says,

832
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,700
 may it be done with me as you have commanded

833
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:00,100
 'cause she could see and she hoped for something

834
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,500
 that was different in the world

835
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,180
 than what she currently could see

836
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,140
 and what she thought she had.

837
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,420
 You go through the whole story this way,

838
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,620
 Joseph willing to marry her,

839
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,300
 God speaking to him in a dream

840
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,460
 and saying, don't give up on this.

841
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,740
 Again, if he had based himself in the present reality,

842
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,980
 he would have wanted to run away.

843
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,740
 Instead, he decides to have confidence

844
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,580
 in what he hopes for,

845
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,460
 he decides to see what is currently not yet seen

846
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,500
 and he decides to continue in the relationship

847
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,420
 and marry her.

848
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,340
 The shepherds, they decide to leave their sheep behind

849
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,740
 and go and meet with Jesus, that was a radical decision.

850
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,460
 They were basically giving up all of their livelihood

851
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,940
 and leaving that behind and moving towards Christ.

852
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,820
 Then you've got Simeon and Anna in the temple

853
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,580
 on the eighth day when Jesus comes in,

854
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,020
 their whole lives were built on faith.

855
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,780
 They refused to only believe what they had,

856
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,500
 they refused to only see what was around them.

857
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,380
 Instead, they had dedicated their whole lives in the temple

858
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,260
 to hope for the coming of the Messiah,

859
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,060
 to believe that they would see it with their own eyes.

860
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,180
 That's actually what Simeon says when he sees Jesus,

861
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,140
 he says, I now can see with my own eyes

862
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,980
 the thing that I had been assured of

863
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,420
 that I didn't yet see, I now see

864
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,460
 and because I now see it,

865
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,940
 you can actually let your faithful servant go to rest.

866
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,780
 In other words, the faith has come through.

867
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,100
 The Christmas story is filled with this invitation to faith

868
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,700
 and when we live in this Advent season of the now

869
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,020
 but not yet, our cry is to move in that direction,

870
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,180
 to find faith rising up in us.

871
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,020
 This confidence of what we hope for,

872
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,860
 this assurance of what we do not yet see

873
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,660
 and when we live like that,

874
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,780
 we truly show the world what it is that God is going to do.

875
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,180
 Now each week, I wanna help you to wrestle

876
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,820
 with these concepts in the week ahead

877
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,020
 and last week, I gave you a series of questions,

878
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,460
 hopefully you did them

879
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,220
 during some quiet time throughout your week.

880
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,980
 If you didn't, I still love you.

881
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,900
 I'm not happy with you but I still love you, okay?

882
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,300
 And I have another series of questions

883
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,340
 that I want you to take a photo of

884
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,260
 and I wanna invite you over the week

885
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,420
 to spend 30 minutes or so reflecting on your answers.

886
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,500
 So you can take a photo of this slide.

887
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,100
 What usually comes to mind when you think about faith

888
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,420
 and how has the teaching today

889
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,220
 helped to redefine this bit for you?

890
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,180
 In this moment of your life,

891
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,060
 what does exercising faith look like for you?

892
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,860
 Where is God asking you personally

893
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,060
 to have confidence in what you hope for

894
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,820
 and assurance in what you do not see?

895
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,380
 Where are you currently holding on

896
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,540
 to what you have more than what you hope for?

897
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,780
 Where are you currently seeing only what is present

898
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,700
 rather than what is promised?

899
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,700
 I think if you took 30 minutes or so this week

900
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,380
 and you really were honest with yourself

901
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,260
 about those questions, I believe for some of you,

902
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,460
 this would be the starting point

903
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,820
 from shifting from a fateful life to a faithful life.

904
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,540
 And it may not be easy and there may be some work

905
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,340
 that you need to do with the Holy Spirit in this process

906
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,140
 but this is Advent, this is what we are called to do.

907
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,780
 We want to live on behalf of God's grand vision

908
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,860
 at the end of all things

909
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,220
 and we want that to have an impact and to change this world.

910
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,460
 Think of it this way, God does not want you to settle

911
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,460
 for the history of humanity.

912
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,260
 He wants you actually to fight for the future of humanity.

913
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:21,260
 The only way that we can do that is if we have faith.

914
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,780
 Can I pray for you?

915
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,620
 Let's pray.

916
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,420
 Lord, we are so grateful for Advent,

917
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,060
 for this now but not yet time

918
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,340
 where we see through a mirror darkly,

919
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,060
 where we don't have all the answers.

920
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,100
 We're grateful that you haven't left us alone in that space,

921
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,780
 that your Spirit is present here with us

922
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,740
 in its fullness within us and around us

923
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,740
 and that we have this thing called faith,

924
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,700
 not a set of doctrinal beliefs as important as they are

925
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,700
 but actually a complete trust in you.

926
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,620
 So much trust in you that we actually let go of our trust

927
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,180
 of what we see right now

928
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,860
 and our trust in what we have right now,

929
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,060
 grateful as we are for those things

930
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,940
 'cause they've come from you

931
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,620
 but if our trust is in only what we have,

932
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,580
 if our sight is in only what we currently see,

933
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,660
 then we're making those our God rather than you.

934
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,940
 And Lord, you shift us to have a confidence

935
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,780
 in what we hope for,

936
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,900
 an assurance about what we do not yet see.

937
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,780
 You shift us out of making idols of our possessions

938
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,780
 and you help us to give our lives to expectation.

939
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,980
 You take us out of being trapped in the past and the present

940
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,860
 and you invite us to life with the future before us.

941
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,780
 And Father, as you pulled back that curtain

942
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,220
 and showed us what the end of the world will look like

943
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,340
 with every tribe and tongue and nation coming together

944
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,580
 with healing being there for all nations,

945
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,660
 Father, we wanna live on behalf of that now.

946
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,700
 Lord, would you help us to separate ourselves

947
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,300
 from the animal world around us?

948
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,580
 Lord, we recognize that if we live without faith,

949
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,780
 we are no better than any of your other species.

950
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:06,380
 You have called and created us in your image

951
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,900
 and faith is our way that brings pleasure to you.

952
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,740
 So Lord, I wanna pray for anyone in this room

953
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,980
 where this message is really hitting for them.

954
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,380
 And perhaps they recognize more fateful thinking

955
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,540
 than faithful thinking.

956
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,100
 Perhaps they see how they're tethered to what they have

957
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,060
 and not free to long for what they do not have.

958
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,940
 As I'm praying, I wanna say this to some of you.

959
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:35,220
 Some of you are remaining in a job that you hate

960
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,220
 rather than having the courage to search

961
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,020
 for the one that you've always longed for

962
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,420
 because you put more trust in what you have

963
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,740
 than in what you hope for.

964
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:47,460
 I believe that's for some of you here in a relationship.

965
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,980
 You're in a relationship that you know

966
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,740
 is not healthy for you, that is not helping you

967
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,260
 and yet you're remaining in that relationship

968
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,420
 'cause you have more trust in what you have

969
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,180
 than trust in what you're hoping for.

970
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,260
 So Lord, if there's anybody here

971
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,860
 where that resonates for them,

972
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,500
 Lord, I wanna pray again for the liberation

973
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,180
 that comes from the work of your Spirit in our lives.

974
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,980
 Lord, I wanna pray that we would have the courage

975
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,700
 to live with faith.

976
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,100
 And that in so doing, we would become the people

977
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,540
 that you've created us to be.

978
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,180
 And we would help to see this world move towards

979
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,780
 that grand vision of every tribe, tongue and nation

980
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,540
 worshiping you, of all of the healing

981
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,940
 on the leaves of the tree in that beautiful city

982
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,380
 that's to come.

983
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,140
 That we would say, that's the vision that drives my heart.

984
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,500
 I wanna live for the future, not past.

985
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,340
 Lord, this is faith.

986
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,300
 I wanna just encourage you just to receive that now.

987
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,780
 The Bible says that faith is a gift of the Spirit.

988
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:55,260
 So I wanna pray for the Spirit of God just to come

989
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,140
 and stir great faith in some of you.

990
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,380
 Some of you, it's been about faith too long.

991
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,620
 It's time for you to move in faith.

992
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,300
 It's gonna take courage.

993
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,980
 It's gonna take a different way of thinking,

994
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,220
 but that is the way you will please the Lord.

995
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,300
 Lord, would you release faith in the name of Jesus

996
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,220
 over these people?

997
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,620
 Lord, would faith rise up?

998
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,580
 Faith rise up.

999
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:26,300
 Lord, give us eyes to see what we currently do not see.

1000
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:32,260
 Give us hope where hope feels like it's been stolen from us.

1001
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,780
 Revitalize our humanity.

1002
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,980
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

1003
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,780
 Everyone says, amen.

1004
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,740
 Hey, would you stand with me?

1005
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,660
 And we're gonna just finish our time together

1006
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,300
 responding in just a time of worship

1007
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,460
 in response to what the Lord is doing here.
