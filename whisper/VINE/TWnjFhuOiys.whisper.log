[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340]   So, if you've been a part of the Vine for any period of time, you'll hopefully know
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.400]   that our vision here at the church is a simple one.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.140]   It is to grow big people.
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.160]   You know, whether you're with us for two weeks, two months, two years, two decades, we want
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.620]   you to grow in your relationship with Jesus.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.480]   And really for us, everything we do at the Vine centers around that passion.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.480]   And growing big people is really the idea of two things.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.600]   First, it's the primary idea of your own personal spiritual growth.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.000]   Your way of learning about yourself, bringing your needs to Jesus, having that restoration
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.640]   and that healing, the anointing upon you, growing and deepening your roots in your spiritual
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.640]   faith journey.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.080]   All of the things that you would expect about your own personal maturity in Him.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.320]   But growing big people is also about becoming a big person in the community and society
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.320]   that you're placed in.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.920]   It's not just about growing for yourself, but it's also then about believing how the
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.400]   gospel grows in your community, about being an individual who stands on behalf of justice,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.960]   of peace, of reconciliation in the brokenness that you see around yourself and your neighborhoods.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.760]   Growing big people is our passion for you personally, but it's also the passion that
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.240]   we believe God has for our city.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.480]   And we want to see us come together to transform not just ourselves personally, but the nation
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.320]   in which we live.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.520]   This was the Apostle Paul's passion when he began the early church.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.680]   I love his letter to the church in Ephesus.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.040]   This was a church that had just been saved out of a Greco-Roman empire.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.920]   And Paul writes to them, passionate for them to understand what it is to grow in their
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.640]   faith, to learn that that faith is given to them by grace.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.080]   They haven't earned it.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.820]   And in that maturity of faith, that they can go into their cities and their societies and
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.120]   change and transform those places for Jesus.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.240]   In chapter four, Paul gets really focused with them around this idea of their maturity
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240]   in Christ.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.240]   And he says, look, if we can all come together, all giving one another these acts of service,
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.520]   we can be built up in the unity of the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, so
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.600]   we could become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.360]   I love that idea.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.080]   The whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.720]   For us at the Vine, that's the central passage that sits around everything we do.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.680]   We want you to know the whole measure of the fullness of Christ for you, for your family,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.180]   and for this city in which God has planted us in.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.240]   And really all the sermon series that we do here at the church, everything we teach, everything
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.000]   we do in our communities, in our ministries, it's all designed to move that idea forward.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.160]   The development of our faith personally and the development and implementation of that
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.760]   faith in the world around us.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.560]   And this series that we're starting today is no exception.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.440]   Back at Vision Sunday, I brought to us this idea that each one of us is a single drop
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.320]   of water in the river that God is unfolding here in our city in Hong Kong.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.020]   That God has called us as the Vine to think about ourselves as this kind of flowing river.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.080]   And I said to us that if we're going to flourish as a church in the future, if we're going
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.840]   to grow and change, if we're going to impact our city, it's going to happen because we're
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.580]   going to find ourselves deepened in our spiritual disciplines.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.960]   That our faith, both as a community and individually, is rooted in something far deeper than just
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.560]   our experience of God together on a Sunday in those 90 minutes when we gather.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.640]   I actually said in that series that one of the things that is challenging to us in this
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.920]   time of COVID is the reality that we often realize that so much of the sum total of our
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.380]   faith is found and dedicated to those 90 minutes on a Sunday.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.260]   So much so that when that's removed from us, as it has been during the COVID time, it actually
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.480]   brings a great sort of disruption to our faith.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.620]   And many of us have struggled to maintain our faith, to deepen our faith in a time when
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.000]   we've not been able to gather regularly together.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.060]   And I said that Sunday, I challenged us with this question, is our faith too dependent
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.720]   on our Sunday gatherings?
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.000]   Now of course, there's nothing wrong with Sunday gatherings.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   We love it.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.060]   This church everywhere experience is fantastic.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.080]   We can't wait to get back into this building, gathering in person together.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.200]   There's something important for our spiritual growth about gathering as a community, worshipping,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.520]   listening to the word.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.000]   We're passionate about it.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.500]   But the reality is, if that becomes the sum total of your faith, if the wholeness of your
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.120]   faith is built on that, I don't think you're living the Christian walk that Paul was calling
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.000]   the church to in Ephesians 4.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.480]   I don't think you're actually going to find yourself strengthening and deepening your
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.760]   relationship with Jesus if you're relying fully on just that Sunday experience.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.240]   Instead, it has to be much deeper and broader than that.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.160]   Because here's the reality, in the hardest moments of life, somebody else's faith is
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.480]   not going to cut it for you.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.820]   Somebody else's passion for Jesus is not going to cut it for you.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.040]   Some preacher or pastor or worship band is not going to come through for you.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   You're going to have to have your own deep roots, your own spiritual walk, your depth
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.560]   in prayer, your reading of Scripture, the spiritual disciplines that God has given us
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   as a gift.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.280]   Those are the things that are going to anchor us for our spiritual growth, no matter what
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.960]   might happen in circumstances and situations around us.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.000]   And that's exactly what this new sermon series is about.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.600]   I said on Vision Sunday that in 2021, we're going to help you to enrich and deepen your
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.560]   spiritual foundations.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.640]   And that's why we're doing Flourish this week and over the next six.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.800]   And really, Flourish is exciting because I get to introduce you today to something that
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.600]   we've been working as and working on as Apostle Team throughout 2020 and something we can
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.560]   now release to you as a church.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.480]   It's called our Spiritual Formation Toolkit.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.320]   And this is an online resource that we've created to help you to journey deeper in your
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.680]   daily spiritual disciplines.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.080]   The Spiritual Formation Toolkit is designed purely for those who want to say, "You know
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.080]   I want to invest in my reality of my faith outside of just what we experienced together
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080]   on those Sundays.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.120]   I want to have deep roots so that no matter what comes in my life, I can flourish."
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.360]   And so we've designed this tool as an online resource to both welcome you and introduce
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.600]   to you what those spiritual disciplines are.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.120]   For some of you, you might be new to the idea of having daily disciplines.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.720]   But also for those of us that maybe have been doing those disciplines for years, we've also
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.640]   designed this resource to help to take you deeper in your journey with those disciplines.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.560]   And we want you to consider the Spiritual Formation Toolkit really as like different
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.520]   ingredients that goes into forming and creating your faith, to strengthening the roots that
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.360]   you have with Jesus.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.880]   And each of those individual ingredients are important.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.600]   In the toolkit, we actually give you six of those ingredients.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.760]   So now I want to kind of show you how this works today.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.640]   Let me show you the first of those ingredients.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.880]   It's the ingredients of Scripture.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   And Scripture is so important because Scripture provides for us the foundation of how we come
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.760]   to understand God's story and everything that is in there.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.640]   But it's not, of course, just about the Scriptures.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.680]   It's also about this other ingredient that I think is really important to bring alongside
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.680]   of it.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.360]   The ingredients of prayer and how prayer becomes so central to our relationship with God, both
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.720]   again personally, but also in community with one another.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.680]   And that raises another ingredient that I think we need to focus on if we're going to
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.080]   deepen our faith.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.520]   And that is to understand that we have community, that we're not supposed to be isolated, that
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.120]   monastery on a hill, but we're supposed to be embedded in doing our faith with others.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.420]   You know, and it's not just about community on our own, but it's also this idea of deepening
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:20.880]   our spiritual friendships, finding those one or two or three individuals that we can go
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.240]   deeper in our community with them on a personal basis.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.520]   And I think when we do that, the fifth of these important ingredients comes to mind
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   for me too.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:38.320]   Yeah, the idea of work and faith, that our Christian experience is not just this private
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.280]   thing that we have, but it's actually something that is to be found in all areas of our lives,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.240]   particularly in the places where we invest a lot of our time in our workplaces.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.280]   And all of this works towards the final ingredients, which I think is this one right here, the
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.540]   idea of evangelism.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:01.600]   The idea of taking our faith and our growth in Jesus and seeing it lived out through the
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.920]   hands and feet of our community in the neighborhoods around us and living out the gospel story
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.940]   so others can be welcomed into it.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:15.060]   So these six elements are the elements that we've captured in the Spiritual Formation
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.380]   Toolkit.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.260]   And what we're going to do over the next bunch of weeks is actually unpack these for you
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.180]   to kind of give you the idea of, "Hey, this is what it's like to be a Christian."
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.780]   You know, you're going to take little bits of elements of each of these areas and you
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.860]   bring them into your life, concentrating on the things that are helpful to you and where
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.700]   you are in this moment.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.140]   And then together, as you bring these together into your life, you actually create the holistic
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:47.300]   strength of what it means to be someone who grows in Jesus.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.180]   I think this is what Paul was talking about, being mature in the faith.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.460]   And so over these next six weeks, we're going to take one of these each week.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.780]   We're going to unpack it.
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.660]   We're going to let you understand it so you get to know all about it.
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.500]   And this week, I get the great privilege of telling you all about Scripture.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.920]   In fact, what I'm holding in my hands right now, for those of you who are millennials
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.360]   and below, this is actually called a physical Bible.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.300]   This is the real, actual thing that you've got on your phone.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:27.260]   I hold in my hands what I think is the most profound and most powerful story that is ever
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.800]   being told.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.420]   This book, I think, is the greatest piece of literature in all of antiquity.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.340]   There is no other book like this one.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.660]   This has been banned, actually, internationally from international bestseller lists because
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.660]   it would be number one every single year.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.860]   I mean, just consider some of the facts about the Bible.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.340]   This Bible has been put together by over 39 different authors.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.580]   39 different authors contribute to the story.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.540]   And some of those authors were some of the most famous and powerful people of their day.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.660]   And some of them were the ones that were on the margins, who were forgotten by society,
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.040]   the ones that were the poorest people of their day.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:16.580]   Inside here are 66 separate individual books, each book that contributes something to the
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.700]   overarching story.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:24.360]   And those books have been written over a 1500 year period, from when Genesis 1 and 2 was
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:31.500]   first captured down to when John the Apostle finishes Revelations 21 and 22, a 1500 year
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.540]   time span of writing down the words of our Scriptures.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:43.900]   And inside those 66 books are 10 different genres, prophecy and legal writings, narrative
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:50.060]   and parables, different forms of commuting what is on God's heart for us, and all of
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.540]   it so that it can tell one simple story.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:59.220]   The story of how God is passionate to restore everything that has been broken.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.980]   A story about a God who moves powerfully in this world to redeem and restore everything
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.500]   back to how He intended it to be.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.900]   The story of a God who has the power to remove sin and bring life again.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:20.220]   The story of a God who sentenced it in the beginning of the bringing of His Son, Jesus.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:27.260]   This book tells one beautiful story, and that story is the Father, the Son, and the Holy
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.660]   Spirit, and it's about how you can find true life.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.600]   Let me tell you a couple of things about reading the Bible.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.820]   The first thing you need to know is that the Bible is not a self-help book.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.620]   The Bible is not designed for you just to use it as some self-help book.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.940]   Now of course, we can go to our Scriptures with our hurts and our pains and our struggles
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.340]   and the things that we're facing, and we can open its pages and we can learn and grow from
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:01.820]   it, of course, but it's not actually designed for you to use it to dip in and out of to
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.020]   get that catchphrase for your day.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:09.900]   I want to also tell you this, you are not the center of its story.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.500]   The Bible is not predominantly about you.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.540]   The Bible is actually about God.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.540]   He is the center of the story.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.020]   It's manifested through the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:28.160]   The Bible sings the story of the beauty of who God is and what God has done.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   It is Jesus.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.740]   It is about Jesus.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.900]   His story found in history.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.880]   And the most compelling and captivating thing about that is that the more that you come
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:45.540]   to understand His story, the more you're able to find your story within it.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.380]   See here's the thing, I think we actually have a Bible reading problem in the global
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.540]   church right now.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.300]   See, I think we actually read the Bible in the wrong direction.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.300]   Let me explain this.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:02.100]   I think so often we actually read the Bible from the position and the direction of starting
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.700]   with ourselves.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.260]   So we start with the lens of our problems and our issues and the things that we're struggling
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260]   with and the things that we're not sure how to handle in our lives.
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:17.620]   And we read down towards the Scriptures, hoping and asking and needing the Scriptures to inform
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.560]   our own story.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.620]   So we're reading in the direction of ourselves to Scripture and we become the lens so that
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:30.100]   everything we read in Scripture is filtered through the lens of my hurt, my pain, my struggle,
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.260]   my needs.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.900]   Everything becomes about that.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.660]   I think if that's predominantly how you're reading Scripture, you're reading it in the
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.380]   wrong direction.
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:44.220]   Instead, I think the Bible is designed for us to read from the direction of the story
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.140]   towards ourselves.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.820]   That we actually start with what God is saying about Himself in the Word.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.340]   That we actually find that in the pages of this book, we get this captivating idea that
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.300]   God has not given up on a rebellious humanity.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.680]   That God is willing to pursue that humanity from every position and every angle.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.720]   That God is willing to come in the Exodus and take a people who are enslaved and bring
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.200]   them into the Promised Land.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.600]   A God who is willing to forgive those people time and time again as they turn from Him
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.280]   and begin to worship other idols.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.820]   A God that brings punishment to them in that and yet has this grace to redeem them every
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.820]   step of the way.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:26.160]   A God who so loves everything in this world that He's willing to send His Son, Jesus.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.880]   That in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, we come to understand our restoration
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.880]   as people.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.040]   And in that restoration, we get to understand why it is that we not only worship Him with
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.800]   everything we have, but we want to see our communities change and transform.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:46.080]   Why when we see injustice happening in our city, we stand up and say, "That is not right."
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.440]   Not because we're trying to be some social activist, but because we believe in the Gospel
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.920]   and what the Gospel says about how God is at work in this world.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:00.520]   When you start with that story, it brings your story alive.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.880]   Maybe we should be reading the Bible in that direction.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:10.240]   You see, for me, all 66 books in this Bible draw that story together.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:16.360]   Each one of them uniquely telling us something, giving us a picture or a window into the person
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   of Jesus.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.800]   Each one of them important for us to know and understand so that we can both understand
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.840]   God and then understand ourselves.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.680]   I want to give you a little illustration of what I think reading the Bible as one story
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.480]   is all about.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.800]   I want you to imagine with me for a moment if I was going to perhaps record a band, a
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.080]   large band, and maybe that band has 66 different instruments in the band.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.880]   And if you were going to record a band like this, if you were like the sound engineer,
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.600]   you would have lots of different mics to be able to pick up all those different instruments.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.800]   And all of that sound would come into like a sound console like this one.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.160]   And you'd have all these different tracks, every single unique individual instrument
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.320]   found in one of those tracks.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.320]   And here's the great thing.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.560]   If you're the sound engineer, if you want to hear like, say, the electric guitar, you
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.800]   just find that particular track, you'd solo it.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.640]   And as the band's playing, all you get to hear is that one electric guitar.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.320]   You can make sure it's in tune and sounds good.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.920]   Or then maybe you might want to solo the drum kit to make sure the drums sound good.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.400]   Or however it might be, you're soloing the individual tracks so that you can listen specifically
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.960]   to what's important for you.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.240]   Now, this is the interesting point.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.340]   The band doesn't want you just to hear the electric guitar.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:42.040]   They don't want you just to hear the one vocal or the one piece of drums.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.640]   The band records the song because it wants you to hear the whole melody.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.540]   It wants you to hear everything that is playing.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.440]   And if all you ever do is hear the electric guitar, then you're not actually hearing the
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.720]   song that is being created.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.600]   Are you following the example?
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.680]   See, I think reading scripture is very much like that.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:05.400]   In fact, I want to give you an actual example together today.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.760]   And I want to show you what I think kind of some of us do when it comes to reading scripture.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.440]   So for example, I can control this sound desk from this little thing here.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.320]   And so I'm going to play a track that I think sounds a little bit like maybe the gospel
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.320]   of Mark.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.400]   I think it might sound something like this.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.600]   So there it is.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.480]   There's like that entry into the person of Jesus.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:34.560]   Mark is this gospel that gives us the action of Jesus, kind of who he is and what he does.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.440]   And maybe you're somebody who loves the gospel of Mark and that's what you often listen to,
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.800]   just that sound.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.400]   But I want to challenge you that actually maybe it's not just about Mark.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.240]   Maybe you also like the gospel of John.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.840]   Gospel of John is a little bit more kind of there than Mark.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.600]   See, the gospel of John doesn't just tell us about what Jesus did, but it also tells
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.440]   us about what he taught.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.280]   So the gospel of John has a little bit more sound, a little bit more fullness to it.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.560]   Or what about maybe you're an Old Testament person, a little bit like my wife, Christine.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.640]   She loves the Old Testament.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.080]   One of our favorite books, perhaps like many of us, is the Psalms.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.120]   I think the Psalms might sound something like this, right?
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.280]   Uplifting and kind of beautiful and the Psalms, we love to go to, don't we?
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.800]   Just for that personal devotion and just for that calming influence that they have.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.880]   I remember many years, John Snowgrove used to tell us that his favorite book in the Old
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.000]   Testament was Joshua, the conquering of the promised land.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.440]   I think Joshua would sound a bit like this, you know, the drum set going, the kind of
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.600]   pounding of the rhythms of the drums as Israel goes into the promised land and defeats the
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.240]   nations there.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.000]   For me personally, my favorite book of the Bible is the book of Acts.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And I think Acts would sound something like this.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.520]   You know, there's that excitement to it.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.680]   It's kind of upbeat.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.040]   It's kind of happening.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.960]   There's movement to it.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.160]   And maybe if you are a reader of the Bible, you read Acts and maybe every once in a while
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.960]   you add in the Psalms and you get kind of that sound as well.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.720]   And there's a little bit of those two things because you're reading both of those books.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.000]   And then maybe if you have time, you throw in the gospel.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.760]   So let's just add Mark back in there as well.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.120]   So you've got Mark and the Psalms and Acts, and you're beginning to hear something more,
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:29.720]   but you're still not actually hearing the song that the artist wants you to hear.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:35.200]   That song actually sounds more like this.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.840]   That's all the tracks, all the tracks that are playing, all 66 of them helping you to
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   hear.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   But here's the reality, so many of us settle with just hearing this.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.600]   We're happy just to hear that one book of Scripture that we focus on perhaps predominantly
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:58.720]   when actually God wants us to hear all 66 of them playing together.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.680]   Every single one creating this incredible sound for us.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.800]   And we settle for just the electric guitar.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:16.280]   And God has us celebrating the whole melody.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.240]   See I think that's what Scripture reading is actually all about.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.680]   I think that's why God gives us 66 books.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.320]   He wants us to hear the whole symphony play.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:34.360]   I think you should read the Bible as in each book gives us something of the melody of Jesus.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.160]   Here it is the symphony of Scripture.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:43.520]   And perhaps right now you've found that your predominant place is reading one book, maybe
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.520]   two books.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.580]   And you think that that's been the totality.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.200]   You think you've got everything you need to know about God and Jesus from just those books.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:56.320]   And I want to challenge you and what this spiritual formation toolkit and this element
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.160]   of exploring the Bible is designed to help you to do is to begin to read the Bible like
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.640]   I've been describing it here today as one story together.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.940]   See the actual toolkit for this particular discipline of exploring the Bible is broken
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.480]   into two sections.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.760]   There is the kind of action steps and then there's going deeper.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.000]   And I want to tell you a little bit practically about that toolkit to help you to begin to
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.960]   think about, okay, I get you, Andrew.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.040]   I want to read the Bible as one story.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.080]   What are some practical ways that I can begin to do that?
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.200]   Well, in those action steps of that particular part of the toolkit, we actually mentioned
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.880]   a couple of things that are good resources for you to get.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.040]   The first is a book that's by Gordon Fee and Douglas Stewart.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.440]   It's called How to Read the Bible for All its Worth.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.680]   And that's a fantastic book that just, I don't get a commission for it, by the way.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:51.560]   It's a fantastic book that just opens up for us so much about what it is to read the Bible
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.080]   as one story.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.560]   How can you interpret those different genres?
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.160]   How do you understand the flow of Scripture?
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.520]   How do you bring it all together?
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.040]   So you're hearing all those individual tracks playing in one song.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   It's a great book to get.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.740]   They actually released a sequel to that book called How to Read the Bible Book by Book.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.420]   And that's a great way for you to understand perhaps those individual tracks on the sound
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.880]   console that helps you to really understand what that particular book of the Bible is
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.780]   about and how that book pushes along the story of Jesus.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.900]   So I can't recommend those two books more highly.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:33.060]   Also in the toolkit, we talk about in the Action Steps segment about the Bible Project.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.880]   You might have already heard about the Bible Project.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.920]   It's a fantastic resource.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.280]   Lots of videos that are online.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.900]   You can go to their website.
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.480]   We have the links to it in the toolkit.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.200]   And the Bible Project will help you to, again, see the totality of Scripture as that one
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   story.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.320]   And you can watch lots of different videos from the Old Testament and the New Testament
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.480]   to begin to really get your understanding of what the books of the Bible are all about.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.520]   And then for those that want to go a bit deeper, we have a further, a kind of going deeper
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.140]   section in the part of the toolkit.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.980]   And there's a couple of things in there I wanted to just tell you about.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:10.920]   First of all, there is a biblical timeline that shows you all 66 books of the Bible and
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.240]   how they fit into a chronological timeline.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.660]   Now this is really interesting and really important because the books found in our canon
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:24.480]   as they occur in the actual Bible are not necessarily in chronological order.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.820]   But what we can do in that timeline is give a map for you to understand the chronological
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.840]   development of the story of God.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.720]   That way, when you're reading a particular book of Scripture, you can link it to that
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.040]   timeline and that will help you to understand the moment in history of that part of the
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.320]   book that you're reading.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.080]   I want to recommend to print out that timeline and put it actually in your Bible.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.520]   It's a great resource for you to have.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.480]   One of the other sections in going deeper is this idea of Lectio Divina.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.080]   You may have heard about Lectio Divina before.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.040]   It's a practice that's happened in the church over thousands of years.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.000]   It's really a way to prayerfully work through Scripture.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.480]   And there's a great app that we tell you about in the toolkit called Lectio 365.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.680]   And it's an app that you can download.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.520]   I believe it's free to use.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.640]   And in that app, there's a daily reflection and devotion, as well as a guide to help you
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.840]   to daily pray through a certain segment of Scripture.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.960]   And it's nothing more important than just reading Scripture, but also than making it
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.240]   a prayer, internalizing it, bringing your faith deeply into it.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.160]   And I want to encourage you to think about doing that.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.840]   The final thing that I want to say is really helpful as you begin to read the Bible as
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.280]   one story is begin to read it from different perspectives.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.880]   There's nothing more valuable for you than to get a group of people together who are
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:48.000]   from different cultures and backgrounds to you and to read the Bible from each other's
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.080]   different culture.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.520]   In this day and age where we see such importance in multiculturalism, where we need to understand
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.960]   and listen to the stories of other cultures and backgrounds, reading Scripture from different
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.640]   people's perspectives can really help.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.480]   That can be different gender perspectives.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.040]   It can be different race perspectives or culture perspectives.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:13.280]   That's a fantastic way for you to open up the glory of God's story in new and fresh
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.280]   ways.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.800]   So I want to encourage you to think about what it might be if you only ever read the
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.320]   Bible with people that look like you, dress like you, sound like you, and believe exactly
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.720]   the same things you do.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.200]   You might want to broaden your reading of Scripture by inviting in some people from
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.920]   different cultures and backgrounds.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:34.640]   I believe that will be an amazing investment that will bring great riches in your life.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.320]   That's the practical elements of the toolkit.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.680]   As I draw today to a close, I want to read you a passage of Scripture where I think all
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.480]   of this idea of reading the Bible as one story comes together.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.040]   It comes from a moment in Jesus' life.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.240]   This actually takes place after Jesus has died and rose again.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.840]   It's during His resurrection moments.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.400]   There are two disciples walking on the road back to their home in Emmaus.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.660]   They just experienced all the things that have happened in Jerusalem with the arrest
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.060]   of Jesus and His death on the cross.
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.080]   As they're walking along the Emmaus road, they're talking together about everything
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.920]   they just witnessed.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:16.000]   Luke tells us in chapter 24 that Jesus comes up alongside them and He holds Himself from
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.440]   being recognized by them.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.400]   I don't know how He did that, but they weren't able to recognize Him straight away.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.600]   He asked them, "What are you talking about as you walk on the road?"
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.600]   They're downcast.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.600]   They're sad.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.160]   They're really overwhelmed by trauma of what they just experienced.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.560]   They turn to one another and they say to Jesus, "Are you not aware of everything that's just
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.200]   happened in Jerusalem?"
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.760]   And Jesus says, "Well, explain it to me."
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.000]   And they said, "Well, there's this Jesus that we believe was the Messiah, but we guess that
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.800]   He must just have been a prophet because they've just killed Him on the cross.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.220]   And what's more, the women have amazed us.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:52.560]   They now tell us that this Jesus has risen from the dead, but we're still not sure.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.360]   Maybe He's just this prophet."
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.080]   And in that moment, Jesus turns to them.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.640]   I want to pick up this passage.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.320]   This is Luke 24, just reading from verse 25 and 27.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.560]   Jesus said to them, "How foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe all that the
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.240]   prophets have spoken.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.880]   Do not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter His glory?"
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:19.480]   And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, He explained to them what was said in all
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.040]   the scriptures concerning Himself.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.400]   "If you could transport me to any moment in history, that's the moment I would want to
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.600]   go to.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.240]   Would you imagine what it would be like to stand next to those disciples with the resurrected
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:38.400]   Jesus and have Jesus open up all of the scriptures for them, the whole of the Old Testament,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:44.280]   opening up all of the Old Testament and showing them how those passages prophesied and spoke
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.280]   about Him?"
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.560]   I don't think what Jesus did was kind of gather it up and go like, "Okay, let's go back to
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560]   Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.160]   Okay, where it talks about He spoke and they came into being.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.160]   That was me.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   I'm the Logos.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   I'm the Word.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.160]   I was right there at the beginning.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.160]   Okay, let's go forward to Psalm 10.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.360]   That's all about me."
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.400]   I don't think that's what Jesus was doing.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.720]   I think instead what Jesus was doing was retelling them the story of Israel.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:10.760]   I think He was going back into the scriptures and telling them the story of Israel and showing
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.860]   them how all of that story now culminates, not just in the birth and the incarnation
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.800]   of Jesus, but in His death on the cross and the resurrection after that.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.480]   And all of that is pushing forward the narrative.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.640]   Jesus is saying, "How slow you are!
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:32.520]   Could you not see in the beauty of all 66 tracks the symphony of the life, death, and
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.120]   resurrection of me, of your Savior?"
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:42.160]   Jesus basically challenges them to read the Bible as one story.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.760]   And it's this amazing thing that the disciples say just after that.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.960]   Let me read this to you in verse 32.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:52.640]   They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while He talked with us
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.360]   on the road and He opened the scriptures to us?"
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.520]   If there's one prayer that I have for us as a community of faith, if there's one thing
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.100]   that I've dedicated the last 20 years of my life to, if there's one thing as your senior
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:10.400]   pastor that I am the most passionate about, it's that your hearts would burn in you as
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.480]   we as a community of faith open the scriptures together.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:19.760]   As you see the Bible come alive, as the words of God don't become this boring thing that
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.400]   you kind of feel like you're forced to read, but you open the scripture starting with the
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.720]   story itself and then find your story within it.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:35.800]   That as you see Jesus come alive in the narrative of the gospels and in all of those 66 books,
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:42.040]   all playing the one track that sings the melody of Jesus, as you hear that, your heart would
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.120]   burn within you.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:49.080]   And there would be change and transformation so you would grow as a big person, deeply
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:55.380]   rooted in the things of the gospel and Jesus and transformative in your outreach to bring
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.880]   justice to the nations.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.280]   That's what I believe the reading of scripture can do.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:08.640]   May your hearts burn in you as God brings alive His Word.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:13.320]   Jesus before He ascends, gathers the disciples in the upper room.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.640]   The Bible tells us He does this amazing thing.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.880]   It says that He opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.760]   I want to pray for you right now.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:27.860]   The Holy Spirit would come wherever you are and open up your mind and give you a new passion
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.480]   for God's Word that it would burn in you like never before.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.760]   So you can understand the fullness of the story of God.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.600]   Let me pray for us.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:43.020]   Father, we stand in this moment as we start this new series of Flourish.
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:48.480]   As we turn our hearts to this spiritual formation toolkit, this online resource available for
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.640]   us so that we can have deep roots in our spirituality on a daily basis.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.720]   Father, we turn to your scriptures today.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:04.000]   Lord, forgive us where we've maximized just one channel on that sound console.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.960]   Where we've made our bread and butter and the depth of our faith simply an electric
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:15.720]   guitar rather than the wholeness of the sound of the melody of the band.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.320]   Lord, would you bring alive once again your scriptures to us.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.600]   Lord, like those disciples in Emmaus, we want our hearts burning within us.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.320]   And it's because you open the Word to us.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.080]   It's because your Spirit comes and helps us to understand what these 66 books have to
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.880]   say about you and how therefore it has to say about us.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:43.120]   Lord, as we open your Word this week, I want to pray for a fresh anointing on the Vine
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   Church.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.480]   Lord, I want to pray that you would come like you did for the disciples in the upper room.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.040]   You would open our minds so we could understand your Word at deeper levels than we've ever
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.440]   experienced before.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.920]   Father, forgive us where we've made ourselves the center of scripture.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.560]   Forgive us where we treated it like some flimsy self-help book.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:06.120]   Lord, root us in your story.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:14.200]   May we find depth and truth and justice and renewal and restoration and hope in the dark
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.720]   times that we're facing all around us in this moment.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.360]   May we find that in a robust understanding of your story.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:26.400]   Lord, would your story come alive to us again.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:33.760]   And as it does so, Lord, we pray for changed lives, changed communities, and we pray for
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   a changed city.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.560]   And we thank you for this.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.880]   In Jesus' name, everyone says, amen.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.880]   Amen.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:41.880]   Amen.
