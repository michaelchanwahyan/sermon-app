[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500]   I guess when we went into it at first we were fairly simple in terms of our
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.660]   thinking of what we were trying to do. As we continued to understand what we were
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.200]   about we had to provide a much wider range of services from financial support
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.220]   and resettlement, doing research, social engagement, empowerment and in fact a
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.460]   whole range of services that are suitable for marginalized communities.
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.220]   Social justice has been part of the church for a long time, right from the
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.420]   beginnings, but when we were just a small community within the basement of a hotel
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.740]   meeting on Sundays only with maybe about 80 or 90 people it was hard for us to
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.980]   put that into practice. But several years later by the time we moved into our own
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.020]   premises we realized that we had perhaps better facilities to offer what we would
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.220]   describe as a 24/7 service. And at that time God provided an
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.420]   opportunity for us. Quite amazing, we had this letter from an asylum seeker who
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.740]   was being detained at the time and he asked us if we would come and visit him.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.140]   And so of course we felt this was the right thing to do to respond well to it
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.020]   and we went to see him, we went through all the procedures of getting in and
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.420]   understanding how all of that worked and we developed a relationship with him,
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.580]   visited him regularly. So when it came for the time for him to be released and
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.780]   others to be released they asked if they could come to our church and we said yes
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.660]   of course we'd be delighted if you came. And the ministry of working with the
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.620]   asylum seekers has now grown into the road program which is part of Branches of Hope.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:19.340]   We were asked to host a gala performance of a documentary film
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.020]   produced by another NGO which showed the difficulties and issues of sex
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.860]   trafficking in various parts of the world. And when we saw this we were quite
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.220]   astonished because the understanding of what is involved in sex trafficking was
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.340]   not generally understood at that time. We soon began to realize just the
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.100]   trauma and the grooming that went on and just the difficulty that girls had who
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:02.300]   were brought into and forced to provide services in that area. And so after we
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.940]   had watched this we began to ask the question what is happening in Hong Kong?
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.740]   How is this related to what's going on in Hong Kong?
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:24.300]   We formed a small movement within the church, I guess it was, of people who were
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.940]   interested in trying to work with people who have been subject to trafficking or
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:42.700]   to exploitation. And as a result of that an organization called Stop Trafficking
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.340]   of People was formed and eventually came under the direction and heading of
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.300]   Branches of Hope.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.260]   Branches of Hope is the Vine community's investment to the city of Hong Kong.
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:10.460]   It is basically our witness to the truth and the vitality of the gospel and so it
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.580]   is important in that sense that we provide something which is a visible
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:24.180]   evidence of what we believe. Well I asked the congregation to listen carefully to
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:32.420]   the work and the experience of Branches of Hope today and as you consider this
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.900]   to ask the Holy Spirit to guide you and to give generously so that this work can
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.340]   continue and that Branches of Hope get the support and the assistance that they
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.900]   need to do the work which is vital to us.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.900]   [Music]
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.180]   Well Church, welcome to BOH Sunday. Let's give a round of applause to Pastor Tony.
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.460]   He is a treasure to our community. If you have spent any amount of time with Pastor
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.140]   Tony you'll know just how sweet and dear he is to us as a community of faith here.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.980]   So we love you Tony. He was here at the earlier service but I just want to give
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.380]   him his flowers whenever possible because we really do appreciate him.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.260]   Well we are on BOH Sunday and so the message today is going to be talking about a role
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.700]   we can play in this grand scheme of what God has called us to do through BOH.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.700]   Let me tell you a bit more about myself. I think as the weeks have gone
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.660]   past it's always good to get to know each other. So most of you know I
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.380]   grew up here in Hong Kong. One of the privileges of growing up in this city,
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.300]   there's so many wonderful things but it is a busy cosmopolitan city and so we
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.820]   see a lot of trends come through this city. A while back I guess,
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.060]   sticker machines were all the rage and I think they're still kind of popular
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.820]   today but back in the day if you went on a date, in order to get a good
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.300]   date you take your date to the sticker machines and make all these cute
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.140]   pictures. You can change yourself into rabbits and all these
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.700]   different kind of things. Put little flowers and you have all those kind of
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.300]   stuff. So sticker machines were very popular. Frozen yogurt was very
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.700]   popular for a while. Do you remember when every other shop was FroYo?
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.500]   You could get FroYo here, FroYo there, FroYo was everywhere and then suddenly
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.540]   they all disappeared. I was a bit disappointed because
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.460]   they didn't all have to disappear. I thought there was a bit much but
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.900]   not all at the same time. It's hard to find frozen yogurt these days but FroYo
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.500]   was a trend for a while. One of the most interesting trends I think we saw
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.980]   in this city and it became such a big, it was not just a trend, it was like an
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.260]   industry in this city that generated probably millions and millions of
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:02.820]   dollars, was the counterfeit DVDs and computer games. Hong Kong was famous
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.100]   for this. I used to study abroad and my friends used to order fake
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.780]   DVDs and they would ask me to bring back to them. But they were
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.940]   everywhere. It was like an open secret. Just down the road there's a shopping
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.300]   mall, 298, that used to be dedicated to fake DVDs, fake computer games.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:27.060]   The system was pretty sophisticated. You walk into this room.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.420]   By the way, allegedly this is what you would do. As a good Christian boy I have
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:37.300]   never been to one of these places. This is all hearsay. Apparently what
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.300]   you would do is I walk into this room and there'd be a post, there'd be
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.140]   little pictures of all the DVDs and the games you wanted. You would
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:52.380]   write the numbers, you know, JN 15 5, TX whatever. You write them
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.660]   on a little piece of paper. They all correspond to the movie or the game you
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.020]   wanted and then you gave the paper to the man or the lady, whoever was working at
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.580]   the shop, the person working there. Then you come back 10 minutes later, they
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.180]   give you a little black plastic bag and there, voila, would be your entertainment
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.500]   for the evening. Like I said, never been to one of these places.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.460]   Certainly never been locked in one while the police were doing a raid and my mom's
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.100]   calling me on the phone saying "Find money!" I was like "I don't even know where I am right now!"
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.340]   This was back in the day. Any movie you wanted you could get in one
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.620]   of those places. The strange thing about these DVDs though, they were so
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:35.060]   obviously fake, yet everybody still wanted them. Even those computer games,
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.140]   half the time it wouldn't be the right game. So you think you'd buy one
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.580]   game, you get a different game. Half the time there was like a virus so your
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.660]   computer would get infected. So the games are always a mess. The DVDs though
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.820]   were the most interesting things. So again, back in the day there were still
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.580]   camcorder versions. You remember those? So someone would go into the
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.620]   movie and record it on a video camera and then reproduce it on a
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.380]   video disc and then you would buy that disc. So you'd be watching at home but
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.260]   then there'd be a head in front of you, moving around.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.620]   You'd hear the person coughing. It's just ridiculous. The most funny
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.060]   was sometimes the movie would be one thing but the subtitles would be to a
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.140]   different movie. So the movie would be like "Die Hard, Die Another Day,
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.420]   Bruce Willis, jumping out of planes, beating up bad guys" and the
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.060]   subtitles would be "Mean Girls, get in loser, we're going shopping".
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:33.780]   So it completely did not match the movie that it was supposed to be showing.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.740]   But why did they sell so well? Why were these so popular? Well because they
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:46.140]   were cheap, allegedly $150, you could get 10 movies for $150 Hong Kong dollars.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:51.540]   So 10 movies. In Hong Kong we speak they were "peng, lang, teng".
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:57.540]   Cheap, beautiful and good, decent enough. Now for things like DVDs and
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:04.140]   video games and things like that, there's a certain appeal to it.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.300]   But the danger of this sort of mentality is, especially us in a fast,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.780]   convenient city like Hong Kong, is that this mentality begins to seep into
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:18.180]   our faith and the way we begin to treat one another as well.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:25.300]   And so the question at hand for us as we consider BOH on this Sunday is this.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.860]   How do we know whether the love we have for each other is true or not?
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:38.020]   Or are we just settling for a cheap, easy, convenient form of loving each other?
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:43.340]   This is a crucial question we need to answer because as followers of Jesus,
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.740]   love sits at the very centre of our identity in Christ.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.660]   And we certainly don't want to be known as the kind of Christians that might
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.500]   appear to have real love on the outside, but if we dig a little deeper into our
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.740]   lives, we're like a bunch of fake DVDs with head shadows and wrong subtitles.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.220]   The kind of Christians that are only able to love when it's cheap and easy
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.140]   and convenient for us.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.020]   But Scripture tells us something different.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.660]   Scripture tells us there is actually a way to know what is real when it comes to
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.700]   how we love each other.
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.940]   1 John 3, 16 to 18 tells us this.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.580]   This is how we know what love is.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.620]   Jesus Christ laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.060]   brothers and sisters.
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.620]   If anyone has material possessions and see a brother or a sister in need but has no
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.540]   pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:44.820]   Dear children, let us not love with words or speech, but with actions as and in truth.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.780]   There's a confidence here to what John is writing.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.700]   This is how we know what love is.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.900]   John is telling us there is a definite way to know.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.940]   See, he himself, John knows this because he has learned these things firsthand.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.060]   He has firsthand experience through walking with Jesus, through living with Jesus,
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.540]   through doing ministry with his Savior.
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.420]   He knows what love is because he has seen and felt this love.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:18.540]   And ultimately, of course, he saw the way that Jesus Christ laid down his life for us
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.140]   on the cross.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.420]   This is how John knows.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.580]   And indeed, as we read through the Gospels, as we read Scripture,
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.580]   we get a picture of how Jesus lived his life.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.700]   And what do we see?
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.820]   Well, firstly, we see Jesus always teaching his disciples about the importance of caring
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:42.620]   for those who may have less than us, for the poor, for the weak, and the oppressed.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.980]   Luke 14, Jesus gives us an example.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.580]   "But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame,
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.620]   the blind, and you will be blessed.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.540]   Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.900]   of the righteous."
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:02.180]   Time after time after time, Jesus teaches us the importance of looking after those
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.420]   who have not, caring for the poor and the vulnerable, welcoming those who have been
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.060]   labeled as outcasts and strangers.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.340]   But it wasn't just talk, it wasn't just teaching that Jesus gave,
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.820]   but Jesus was always the one who was willing to actively do these things.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.620]   He was always the one willing to stand with the poor, the weak, and the oppressed.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.980]   Jesus was always the one willing to reach out to the outcasts of society,
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.540]   the sinners, and the prostitutes, the lepers, people that were deemed not worthy
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.060]   to be in community.
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.820]   Jesus was always the one who was showing care and provided for the ones who needed
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.500]   it the most.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.380]   And ultimately, Jesus showed that even though he himself was in a position
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:52.500]   of power and authority, he was willing to give everything up so that we could
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.780]   be set free.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.820]   Philippians 2 reminds us of this, "Having this mind among yourselves,
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.380]   which is yours in Christ Jesus," Paul says, "who though he was in the form
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.460]   of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.860]   by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men,
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.500]   and being found in human form."
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.660]   Listen, "He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death,
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.860]   even death on a cross."
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:24.260]   And we know beyond the shadow of a doubt that Jesus laid his life down for us,
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.540]   both in the way he lived his life on this earth, but also, of course,
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.900]   the ultimate sacrifice on the cross.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.340]   This is the foundation of our faith.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.100]   This is the part we know and love.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.380]   This is the part we want to rest in, right?
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.020]   This is the part that gives us comfort.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.260]   This is probably what made you fall in love with Jesus in the first place.
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.140]   A person that loved me so much that would die for me, a person that thinks that way
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.460]   about me, I could get behind this.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:55.660]   But hand in hand with that has to come a response from us.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.940]   There is responsibility.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:02.340]   There is a need here to respond in a real and tangible way.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.980]   And we've been talking about this throughout the year because it's an
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:12.700]   essential part of our relationship as identity, as a follower of Jesus.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:18.860]   In other words, if we really want to be like Jesus, this must mean living our
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.460]   life as he did.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:27.220]   And if Jesus laid his life down for us, the challenge is now that we ought to lay
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:32.060]   our lives down for our brothers and sisters.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.140]   Again, though, this asks us a question.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:40.380]   What does it mean to lay our lives down for our brothers and our sisters?
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.740]   So on one level, I think ultimately it involves literally laying our life down
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.340]   in a very real way.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:53.100]   Just as Jesus was willing to literally go to the cross and die for us, if it ever
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:59.180]   comes to that extreme moment, would we also be willing to die for others?
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.100]   If the call for martyrdom ever came on behalf of our brothers and sisters,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.060]   would we take that call?
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.260]   Now, we're fortunate enough to live in a time and place where perhaps most of us
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:15.100]   in this room don't have to worry about these things, although perhaps I think
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.980]   that there are people who have fled their homes in fear of persecution in their
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.260]   faith in Jesus.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:29.980]   But in some sense, I even think that a heroic moment of martyrdom is sort of
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.340]   easier to do in some ways.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.140]   You know what?
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.700]   If push came to shove, we would say, "I'd be willing to put my neck on the line
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.140]   for faith.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.580]   I'd be willing to go all the way for my family.
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.140]   I could do that."
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.660]   And that's good.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.140]   That's great.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:43.780]   That's brave.
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.620]   That's the kind of faith we always want to cultivate.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.500]   However, like I said, if we were going to keep it real, the majority of us will never
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.580]   really be called to take such a drastic action.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.900]   So does that mean this verse doesn't apply to us?
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.940]   That we don't need to do anything unless that very big and dramatic moment comes
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.300]   knocking on our door?
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.860]   What scripture is trying to teach us here is that laying down your life doesn't always
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.180]   have to mean literally giving up your life.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.780]   But laying down your lives is actually a much more down-to-earth,
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:23.660]   much more practical, and probably an even more challenging way to live.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.940]   John gives us very clear advice and expectations on what laying down our life
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.420]   for our brothers and sisters means.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:36.860]   And he's not talking about a dramatic death, a sacrifice of martyrdom,
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.100]   but rather it's a sacrificial life.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.460]   It's sacrificial living.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:49.260]   Verse 17, "If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:55.380]   in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?"
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:02.500]   In other words, the needs of this world is not for heroic acts of martyrdom so much,
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.860]   but more for heroic acts of material sacrifice.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.540]   And in a way, like I said, this is the harder thing to do because living like this
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.260]   means that we cannot just love each other in a cheap way.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.620]   Living like this means our lives are going to be disrupted.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.140]   We really have to have the love of Jesus in our hearts and not some fake pirated DVD
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.260]   cheap version here.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:30.620]   Jesus reminds us of the same concept himself, "Greater love has no one than this,
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.340]   than he lay his life down for our friends."
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.020]   To make it even more clear, Scripture says in James chapter 2,
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.140]   "Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.020]   If one of you says to him or her, 'Go, I wish you well.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.740]   Keep warm and well-fed,' but does nothing about their physical needs,
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.500]   what good is it?"
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:58.380]   Genuine love must be accompanied with tangible action and actual giving.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.020]   We cannot say we love God if we're not loving each other because if anyone says,
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.900]   "I love God," yet hates his brother, he is a liar.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.100]   For anyone who does not love his brother who he has seen cannot love God whom he
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.380]   has seen.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:17.060]   Love for God, providing for brothers and sisters, goes hand in hand.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.940]   I mean, think about it this way.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.580]   What if Jesus said, "I love you.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.900]   I'm here for you," but never actually did anything for us?
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:34.660]   Didn't go to the cross, didn't offer us a way out of our sin and darkness and shame?
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.620]   What if all you ever did was say to your friends and family, "Yeah, I love you.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:37.980]   I love you.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.060]   I love you," but never actually did anything to show them that love?
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:48.060]   Didn't provide for them, weren't there for them, didn't listen to them.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.780]   Would that really be love at all?
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:58.380]   And I contest to us, brothers and sisters today, the same has to apply to us here,
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.500]   this family, this community of followers of Jesus.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.100]   Because amongst us today, amongst our family, there most certainly are brothers
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.740]   and sisters who are in need.
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.620]   And perhaps the most vulnerable people out of all in our city, for those who are in
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.820]   need, our brothers and sisters in the refugee and asylum seeker community,
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.300]   they are our brothers and sisters who have become victims of human trafficking
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.620]   and forced labor.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.220]   I won't go into the facts and stats.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.580]   You know, you can look up for yourselves, but imagine yourself living in this city,
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.980]   not being able to work, not being able to earn money.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.420]   You can't even attend school or go on a course or anything like that.
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.620]   Living in one of the most expensive cities in the world, facing all kinds of racial
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:49.660]   and social prejudice, this is the reality that they face every day.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.620]   Imagine being coerced into coming to a big, strange city looking for a job so that you
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.700]   could provide a future for your family, only to find out that you've been
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.140]   exploited and abused.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.260]   Material possessions, food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, education,
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.620]   things we might actually take for granted, things that we have plenty of.
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.700]   If we see these needs in others and have no pity on them and don't actually do
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:18.060]   anything to help those who need these things, then we don't really have love
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.780]   inside of us.
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.580]   How can the love of God be in that person?
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.740]   The answer is, it's not.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:33.020]   Therefore, laying down our lives is a commitment we make to each other.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.980]   It's saying that because I love Jesus and because you love Jesus and Jesus loves
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.780]   you, that makes us brothers and sisters.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.940]   That makes us a body of Christ.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.180]   That makes us a family.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.420]   And when one part of the body hurts, the whole body hurts.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:57.220]   So yes, we're saying we're willing to go out of our way to help, to help meet the
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:02.700]   needs, to be made uncomfortable or inconvenienced ourselves so that others
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:08.500]   in need might have the life we live as well.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:15.260]   The bottom line is this, the way we show love must, it has to involve those who are
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:21.620]   taking care of those who are in need whilst we still have time on this earth.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.260]   It's not just something we talk about, but we have to practice it.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.300]   And this is going to mean using your resources, your talent,
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:36.380]   sacrificing yourselves, being inconvenienced to relieve the needs of others.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:42.260]   This church, what it looks like to love in action and in truth.
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.940]   Now, it all seems a bit overwhelming, right?
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.060]   You're feeling guilty right now, maybe feeling convicted.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.460]   You're, "Okay, okay, what do you want me to give?"
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.180]   Right?
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.180]   That's not what it's about.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.860]   Let me give us a starting point.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.940]   The first thing we need in this journey of sacrificial living for the others,
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.020]   the first thing we need is to open ourselves and allow the Holy Spirit
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.100]   to speak to us.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.180]   This has to be our starting point because remember, this is God's idea, right?
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.380]   We're not just talking about goodwill or charity.
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.700]   That's not what it's about.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.140]   It's about God's heart.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.660]   It's about doing what God has called us to do.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:25.420]   But when we are obedient in the way he wants us to give, if we're obedient in the
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:30.140]   way he wants us to sacrifice, and it might be very different in every single person,
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.700]   God's going to use that in a way that you could have never come up with yourself.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.260]   Let me give you an example by sharing this personal story with you.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.500]   A few years ago, my wife and I were on a Christmas outreach.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.300]   This was a few years ago.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.020]   We were out in the TST area, and the outreach was to meet ladies who were
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:53.940]   working on the streets in the sex industry to let them know about a Christmas party,
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.300]   a bazaar that they were hosting the next day.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.820]   And so we were walking around, and we talked to a few people, and the whole
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.660]   afternoon went pretty normal, like nothing super eventful.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.180]   We came across a few people.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.660]   We gave them an invitation, had a quick chat with them.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:15.380]   Nothing spectacular actually happened on that afternoon itself.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.980]   And soon enough, it came time for us to meet up with a big group again,
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.860]   and it was time to go home.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.700]   But on the way back, my wife Brittany said, "Hey, you know,
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.100]   let's just walk down this road one more time."
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.900]   This was on Moody Road in TST.
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.380]   I still remember it very vividly.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.900]   "Let's go the long way.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.940]   I feel like God's saying, 'Walk down this road one more time,
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.460]   and we'll see what happens.'"
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.300]   And so we did.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.340]   Very simple instruction God was giving.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.460]   We walked down this road one more time.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.420]   And as we walked down this road, we bumped into Donna.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.100]   And so as we did with the other ladies, we stopped, we chatted,
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.820]   and invited Donna to come to the event.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.740]   Now, we must have, you know, the whole team must have handed about like 50 or so
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.300]   invitation cards out that afternoon.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.420]   And we weren't sure what kind of a response we got.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.580]   And indeed, the response was quite low.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.220]   But one of the people who responded the next day was Donna.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.980]   So Donna shows up to this ministry center, and that was the moment we get
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:19.540]   to got to chat with her, sit with her, got to know her story a little bit better.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.460]   And Donna was from an African country.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.260]   She came to Hong Kong because she was promised a job as a caretaker for
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.820]   elderly people.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.780]   But of course, that was a lie.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.860]   And she ended up being a victim of human trafficking.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.460]   Her money soon ran out, which meant that she had to claim asylum.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.340]   And to make ends meet, she turned to sex work.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.660]   But through the support of the ministry, through prayer,
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.260]   through the community coming around her, through people giving sacrificially time,
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:54.100]   money, and resources to make sure she didn't have to go back on the streets,
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.660]   through providing her with new skills training, by the time she went back to her
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.340]   home country, Donna was like a new person.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.900]   And to this day, you know, we're still in touch every now and then.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.060]   She had learned baking skills while she was in Hong Kong.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.900]   So when she got back to her home country, she opened up a bakery.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.620]   But actually, in fact, her real passion was to educate children.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.140]   So out of the resources that she got from opening her bakery,
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:24.180]   she has now started three different schools in her home country,
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.580]   educating children, giving them a hope and a future as well.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.820]   There's evidence, there's pictures we could show you to see the amazing work God
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.300]   has done in her life.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:40.140]   Now again, what did it actually require of me that day?
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.620]   Not very much.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:48.300]   Giving up an afternoon, walking a few extra blocks in response to the Holy Spirit's
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:54.420]   prompting, but it was a response of action and of truth.
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.740]   It was a response of love and obedience.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:03.340]   It was a response of actually doing something that God had asked us to do.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.620]   And so in a minute, Alex, our executive director, branches of hope,
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:11.620]   beloved friend and colleague, will come here and share.
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.540]   He's going to tell you a little bit about the needs of VOH.
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.900]   And as Alex explains these needs to you, as you hear them, I believe that there's
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:25.740]   a response and an action that everyone in this room can take today when you hear
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.420]   about them.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.580]   For some, I pray it might be to write a big check and say, "Yes,
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.580]   I have the resources.
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.460]   I'm going to give generously today."
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.260]   For some, maybe it's, "I'm going to sponsor a family in the STAR program,"
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.660]   which we'll hear a bit more about.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.900]   For some of you, it might be saying, "I'm going to commit to making friends
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.980]   with someone in the refugee and asylum seeker community.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.380]   I'm going to volunteer my time.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.340]   I'm going to do community with them."
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:57.620]   Whatever it is, if we claim to have the love of God in our hearts,
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:02.260]   which I think all of us here do have the love of God in our hearts,
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:07.620]   then here's an opportunity to demonstrate it by the way we lay down our lives
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.380]   for each other.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.420]   So, ladies and gentlemen, would you help me in welcoming our lovely
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.100]   Executive Director of Branches of Hope, Alex.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.940]   - Thank you.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.020]   Thanks, Alison.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.420]   Hello, everyone.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:27.460]   It is always a moving experience to be here with you all in the Vine for Branches
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.100]   of Hope Sunday.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.700]   It is a real privilege to be given this space to tell you a little bit more
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:36.220]   about ourselves and also to invite all of you to walk alongside us.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:41.420]   Now, before I pick up where Pastor Alison left off, I'd like to show you two short
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.580]   videos just to illustrate the needs of the people that we're serving through the
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:49.660]   Road and Stop programs and as well to illustrate a little bit about the impact
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.220]   that we have at Branches of Hope.

[00:28:55.220 --> 00:29:00.060]   - My name is Ali.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.580]   I am from Yemen.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:09.420]   When I come Hong Kong, I need help for asylum seeker, for some homes,
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.980]   and how can we live here?
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:21.060]   The difficult government now give enough for rent, for food, everything,
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.820]   not enough.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.020]   This problem, and the asylum seeker cannot work.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:31.940]   If I go work, maybe I go jail, catch me police or migration.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.780]   This is problem.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.580]   And I worry for my family.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.860]   I have three baby here.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.180]   Yeah, because this big problem.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.700]   Some friend, he tell me, "You can go buy in charge.
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.020]   After I go, after.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.460]   Help me."
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:57.420]   I give extra money for rent, for something, for school, for...yeah.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:03.500]   Have class English because we're boring in Hong Kong, no work, no.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:10.060]   I am happy because help me.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:15.820]   The buying help for some money every month, we're fine.

[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:34.980]   - Now, some of you may have noticed that in his testimony, Ali actually didn't
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.140]   mention branches of hope by name.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.700]   He spoke of the vine.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:42.140]   And I think this is a beautiful symbol of just how closely aligned branches of hope
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.140]   and the vine are.
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.220]   And I'll come back to that in a little bit.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:51.180]   But what I want you to take away from the story is, you know, the sense of stifled
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:56.100]   opportunities that Ali and his family face, the limited resources that they have
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:02.780]   to deal with, and the endless waiting to find out what happens next, you know.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.260]   We walk together with asylum seekers like Ali and his family to meet these
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.900]   challenges head-on and to strengthen their sense of dignity while they're here
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.380]   in Hong Kong.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.380]   Now, let's have a look at another video.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.420]   - My name is Anna.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.500]   I'm from the Philippines.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:27.140]   I came to Hong Kong my first time in 2019.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:32.780]   I worked with my employer for four years and three months.
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.420]   I came here through my sister-in-law.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:39.620]   She helped me to come here.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:44.180]   I have been involved with criminal exploitation.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.820]   The police came in my employer's house and then arrest me.
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:56.220]   Some people, these people, I don't know, they use my name to use it in illegal,
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.500]   criminal, criminal what is.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.740]   That's why I'm involved with this case.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.220]   - That's why you lose your job?
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.220]   - Yeah, I lose my job.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:15.820]   I'm so grateful and blessed because I found my where to live because I don't have job.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:21.100]   I cannot afford to stay in the boarding house.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:27.340]   And then after that, my co-shelter introduced me about the stop.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:35.140]   I go to the office and then ask for help.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.580]   The basic necessities, they help us.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.460]   They help me.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:48.740]   And then I also share with my, I can also share some with my co-shelter.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:59.060]   Not only financial, also emotional, they are very, very kind.
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.260]   They help me a lot.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.660]   That's why I'm in good now.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:16.580]   I always thank God because even though I face this struggle, I'm about to face it because
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.940]   the people surround me, especially stop.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.380]   I feel, I feel not alone.
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.980]   We can always rely on them.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:49.740]   Sadly, Anna's story is also quite typical of the community we serve through the stop
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.740]   program.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:55.620]   In fact, you might have heard some parallels to the story of Donna that Alison shared,
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.620]   right?
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:03.620]   She's somebody who has left their family, their home behind in order to make a living,
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.260]   you know, which in itself is a very difficult decision.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:14.060]   Then only to end up in a situation where they're being exploited and in some terrible cases
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.100]   scammed into illegal acts.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.580]   So this is, again, indicative a little bit about the community that we serve through
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.300]   the stop program.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:27.580]   The support that we provided Anna and cases like her is what actually allows them to even
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.540]   begin to access justice, right?
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.060]   Because if they aren't able to sustain themselves more often than not, it's a short process
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:38.860]   for them and they're not actually able to see through and gain the justice that they
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.260]   deserve.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:49.060]   No matter how many times I hear stories like Ali's and Anna's, they move me deeply every
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.260]   single time.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:56.960]   I could not be standing in front of you all doing what I do if that were not the case.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   But here's the thing.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.860]   What I want you to think about, what I want you to realize is that these are only two
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:06.580]   stories, two voices out of thousands that have already been served by Branches of Hope
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.340]   since it was founded by the Vine Church.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:15.460]   And the thing is, there are multiple thousands more who we have yet to reach.
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.660]   If you're not familiar with Branches of Hope, Tony's introduction at the beginning of the
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.140]   sermon today was a great starting point.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.380]   But let me just briefly summarize what it is that we actually do.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:31.820]   We have a dedicated team of passionate professionals who work as part of our two programs, the
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:36.300]   Refugee Opportunity and Development Program, or ROAD, and the Stop Trafficking of People
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.580]   Program, or STOP.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:45.460]   Those two programs together serve refugees, asylum seekers, and those who are facing situations
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:49.820]   of trafficking or labor exploitation here in Hong Kong.
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.620]   What we do is we provide three main things.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:56.900]   We provide care, we provide empowerment, and we raise awareness.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.500]   We provide social change.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:03.180]   The way that we do that is by providing for the immediate material needs.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:08.220]   So we care for them, we provide shelter, food, medical referrals, whatever is in that immediate
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.180]   need that they might have.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.940]   We empower them to live a more dignified life while they're here in Hong Kong and give them
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.940]   hope.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:21.660]   That could be through some of our classes, some of our community activities.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:26.940]   And we raise awareness for the situations in which they're in.
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:33.500]   Because unfortunately, so often it's far too easy to overlook not just the situations in
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:37.180]   which they are, but the people in those situations as well.
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.500]   And they don't deserve that.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.740]   Nobody deserves to go unnoticed.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:48.700]   None of what we have achieved and nothing that we are ambitious about achieving in the
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:54.700]   future could be possible without you and this community and Jesus Christ.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.900]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.500]   Nothing we have done, nothing that we are going to do is possible without you and this
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.660]   community and Jesus Christ.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.180]   Can I get an amen?
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:14.100]   Every little act of faith adds together to be greater than the sum of its parts.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:18.740]   What I do, what you do, what every single one of us does, you can break it down into
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.700]   those little building blocks, but ultimately if God is moving among us, the outcome is
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.860]   far greater than what we could have imagined.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:32.420]   Like Tony said, social justice is part of the Vine's identity.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.540]   It's DNA even.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.860]   And with the Vine as our founding member, we share that DNA to this day as we strive
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:44.180]   to fulfill what we were called to do, and that is to be the justice expression of this
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.700]   community.
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.860]   This is why Ali, you know, in the video, not making a distinction between the Vine Church
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.340]   and Branches of Hope is so significant.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.820]   Because when it comes to the passion to serve, when it comes to that heart of service, we
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.980]   are one and the same.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:07.860]   That's not just reflected in today's sermon, but on many a Sunday here at the Vine Church.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:12.940]   Be it Carla preaching on Lazarus and the rich man, or, you know, promise of dissecting the
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:18.300]   church's role in reconciling humanity, or Andrew reflecting on the subversive act of
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.020]   generosity, the list goes on.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.300]   This is not something that we only do once a year.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:27.300]   This is a rolling theme for this church.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.220]   You know, something that has been bouncing around my mind when we, ever since we first
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:35.740]   started planning Branches of Hope Sunday for this year and started to kind of zero in on
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:42.180]   what we wanted the lineup to be, and finally decided to have Tony and Allison play these
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:47.300]   parts for us, is it's actually a very beautiful combination.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.300]   You all know Tony.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.300]   He's the founding pastor of the Vine Church.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:56.300]   You know, you can consider him the OG of the Vine Church in many respects.
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:01.900]   And in that capacity, he was also the architect behind the founding of Branches of Hope.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.220]   He was there from day zero.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.940]   And Allison, well, you know, he's gotten a bit older too.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.900]   He's not part of 180 anymore.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:10.900]   Let's put it that way.
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.260]   Let's be kind.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:19.740]   But he does represent a younger generation of spiritual leaders at the Vine Church.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.780]   And it just runs the full gauntlet, doesn't it?
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.300]   You know, from the very beginning until now, and to have these two generations, these two
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:32.780]   spiritual leaders of our church stand here on our behalf, supporting us, walking with
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:38.500]   us, pouring themselves out into the issues that we deal with, it means so much to me,
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:44.860]   to my team, and more importantly to the community that we serve.
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.860]   And here's the thing.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:55.220]   It also speaks to the resilience of this church and the values it was built around.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.220]   Did anybody here watch the Olympics?
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.220]   Yeah?
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.580]   A couple of you did.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.460]   Maybe just the opening or closing ceremonies?
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.460]   None of the sports?
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.460]   All right.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:10.220]   The important thing is, did you see the lighting of the Olympic flame?
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.220]   Iconic, right?
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.800]   That's what this feels like to me.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:22.220]   Though the years come and go, and the faces both behind the pulpit and in the chairs change
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:29.780]   over time, this church stays true to its mission and itself, passing on the flame of faith,
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:35.980]   of justice and righteousness from generation to generation.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.080]   That is what Branches of Hope Sunday is all about.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.380]   It's about sharing the flame.
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.180]   Some of you will have been coming to the Vine for many years, and you have kept our flame
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.900]   alight in all that time.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:55.260]   Please hear me when I say from the bottom of my heart, thank you so very much.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.260]   It is your faithfulness that has sustained us.
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:03.820]   You light the path that we tread on.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.300]   Others among you may have only been recently coming to the Vine or not have had the chance
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.620]   to become involved with Branches of Hope.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.820]   Well, you're lucky.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:17.940]   Today is your chance, not just to make a tangible contribution, but ultimately to become part
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:23.500]   of something bigger, to be a part of our impact, to be a part of this community, and fundamentally
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.140]   to carry that flame forward.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.220]   Now it can take many different shapes.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:35.100]   Alison already alluded to that previously.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:42.220]   At the very, very basic instance, what I'm asking from you all is your prayers.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:47.220]   As a community in Christ, I need all of you to be able to intercede on our behalf, to
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:52.900]   pray for the needs of our community, to pray that Branches of Hope has the talent, the
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.860]   grit, the resources to keep doing day in and day out what they are doing.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.920]   And believe me, there are challenges in this work.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:06.500]   We recently actually released a prayer guide through the community groups, and I invite
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.100]   you to have a look at that prayer guide.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.540]   If you don't know where to start, it's a great place to have a look at, get a sense
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:16.260]   of what it is that we do, but also to read about the prayer requests directly from our
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.660]   community.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.580]   So if there's one thing you want to do tonight, I ask you to pray.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.600]   For those who want to put their faith into action, come and volunteer with us.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.620]   We have a bunch of events every single year.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.580]   We've got the football tournament coming up in just a couple of weeks.
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.920]   We need your help.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.300]   Without volunteers, we're not able to make these things work.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.140]   We're not able to make it run smoothly.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.340]   Come and spend some time with us.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.040]   Come and help us out.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.300]   If you want to come to meet some of the communities that we serve, then go on an outreach with
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.300]   our STOP team.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.100]   They go on outreach to the migrant domestic workers on Sundays.
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.420]   Get to know them.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:00.700]   If you're connected somehow to the US or Canada, we would love for you to put us in
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:06.060]   touch with your networks, to those who could be potential supporters for refugees and asylum
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.180]   seekers when they leave Hong Kong.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.060]   The US and Canada are the only two places that we're actually able to help people get
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:20.420]   to and come back into a situation of flourishing, being able to enjoy the full rights and freedoms
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.900]   that we get to enjoy here in Hong Kong that they are denied.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.700]   But for the time being that they are here in Hong Kong, I invite you to invest in our
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.420]   STAR program.
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:35.740]   This is a monthly financial assistance program that we've set up that allows you to contribute
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:40.500]   to the financial stability of family members here in Hong Kong.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:47.100]   And believe me, even the smallest amounts make up a huge difference every single month.
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:51.100]   I invite you to explore all of these opportunities more just right outside the door after the
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.100]   service.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.420]   My colleagues are eager to have a chat with you.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.900]   But I want to be honest with you.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:05.140]   In this moment today, what I want to call you to do is to reflect on Ellison's message
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:09.220]   and respond to the love of Christ.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:12.100]   Ellison spoke of heroic acts of material sacrifice.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.300]   But let's face it, sacrifice sounds painful.
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:23.140]   So instead, what I am offering you is to become a part of a living, breathing act of faith
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:29.060]   that continues to do God's work in Hong Kong and has been sustained for the past decade.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:33.940]   It is with shameless audacity that I, like the friend knocking at your door at midnight,
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:38.460]   that I am calling on all of you to become a part of Branches of Hope and carry the flame
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.980]   forward.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:45.860]   If this is your church, if this is where you tithe, if you believe in the social justice
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:51.580]   mission of Divine Church and Branches of Hope, then I pray that the Holy Spirit moves among
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:58.400]   you to give and give generously out of compassion and conviction.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:05.700]   May God bless and multiply your offerings so that we may continue His work and together
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.420]   be a light that shines just a little brighter in the city we all call home.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:10.580]   Thank you.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:17.580]   >> Thank you, Alex.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:22.540]   Well, this is an opportunity now for us to respond.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:26.140]   And you will notice that we didn't take up our tithes and offerings in our usual way
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:32.020]   after our worship because we as a church wanted to create the space and also to say that we
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.300]   will give everything that is given today.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:39.700]   All the tithes, all the offerings, all the donations that is given will go directly to
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.260]   the work of Branches of Hope.
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:44.100]   So there are a number of ways that you can give.
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.700]   They will be showing on the screens.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:53.820]   The envelopes on your chairs also are available for you and our hosts will hand out the buckets.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.980]   At the same time, after the service, there will be an opportunity to meet with the incredible
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:02.540]   team outside and to hear about what they're doing, to buy some of the merchandise that
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:09.260]   is there and also to support the STAR program as well.
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:16.860]   So in this atmosphere, would you stand with me as we begin to worship in our response
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:23.860]   as we as a church declare that we are a church of social justice, we are a church that does
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:33.180]   more than just speak out, but actually our action is a witness to everyone in this city.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:39.020]   So let us respond and then we will come and one of our Arise community will be praying
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:52.300]   for the offering as I then close our service.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:57.220]   If you feel that during this week that you would also like to give, then please you can
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:02.380]   do it in the same way that we have showed in the various QR codes.
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:07.820]   Just we ask that you would put in the remarks that it is for BOH Sunday to make sure that
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:13.060]   we can forward all of that to BOH.
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.460]   And I would love to invite Mercy.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:21.220]   Mercy is from our Arise community and she is going to pray for our offering and as we
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.220]   close our service together.
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:31.020]   Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for all your blessing toward us.
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:37.060]   Thank you that you are loving Father who take care of all of us children.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:44.060]   We put our hope of faith in our trust in you to provide for all needs.
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:49.020]   You told us to seek your will in our first.
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.180]   Enter priorities walking according to your way.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:58.140]   As we do that, you promise to meet all of daily needs.
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.940]   We thank you for your promise toward us.
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:09.060]   Father, we lift up this offering that has been received through the generosity of all
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.220]   your people here today.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:18.340]   We have already been receiving from you and now it is our joy to freely give back to you
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.900]   for the work of bringing you kingdom here on earth.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:30.180]   Just as it is in heaven, thank you for inviting us to partner with you in this way.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:39.140]   We ask you to bless this offering and to give us wisdom as we stay with this resources of
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.140]   your behalf.
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:48.980]   May your will be done and your kingdom continue to grow in your lives in our city.
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:49.980]   We pray.
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:52.420]   This is the mercy of Jesus.
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.940]   In the name of Jesus, amen.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.940]   Amen.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:03.180]   Thank you everyone for joining and being part of our BOH Sunday.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:07.500]   Don't forget to check out the booths and to meet with the incredible staff.
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.500]   Well done, BOH staff.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.940]   You did an amazing job today.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:15.380]   Do check out what's going on there in the booths.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.220]   And of course, if you would like prayer, then please also do come forward.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.580]   We will have a prayer team that would love to pray with you.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.340]   It's been great to have you here in our service.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.380]   Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:28.620]   God bless.
[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:31.260]   Take care and we'll see you next week.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:31.780]   Bye.
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:59.780]   [Music]
