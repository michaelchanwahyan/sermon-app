[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   And I'd love to invite up one of our elders, Susannah Lynham,
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.500]   and she's gonna be with us today.
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.700]   And she's bringing the word, which we're excited about.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.600]   We're considering our series, A Different Spirit,
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.080]   This is Your First Time to the Vine,
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.360]   or This is Your First Time Into the Series,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.520]   particularly if you're watching online as well.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.000]   We started the series three weeks ago.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.540]   We wanna encourage you to go onto our YouTube,
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.760]   connect and catch up on this.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.760]   We're looking at such an important topic today,
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.340]   and one that I know is gonna be both challenging,
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.460]   but also healing for you.
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.960]   So why don't we stretch out our hands
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.240]   as we pray for Susannah.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.160]   Holy Spirit, we're grateful.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.440]   Grateful for what your word does,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.260]   that scripture comes and uproots,
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.000]   tears down, destroys, overthrows,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.580]   and yet also builds and plants in us.
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.000]   And so as Susannah comes with this word in her heart,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.780]   as we get to look afresh at Caleb and Joshua's journey,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.360]   Lord, I pray that you would just really uplift
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.940]   and uproot the things in us
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.040]   that you want us to be free of, Lord.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.040]   May we be a church that literally does walk
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.520]   in this time with a different spirit.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.960]   We thank you for this in your name, amen.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.560]   - Good morning.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.280]   A Different Spirit, this is a series we've been looking at.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.760]   And I remember when Andrew first sent me the email,
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.600]   inviting me to be a part of this series.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.320]   And I opened it excitedly and ran my finger down the topics.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.760]   Where's my name, where's my name?
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.600]   And beside my name, a different spirit, will we repent?
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.240]   I was thinking, did I draw a short straw
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.680]   that I didn't know about?
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.800]   But you know, sometimes the sermons
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.400]   that are the hardest to prepare,
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.640]   sometimes the sermons that are the hardest to hear
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.680]   are the ones we need the most.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.640]   I just want to welcome all the people
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.340]   joining us online today.
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.560]   You're not here by accident,
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.840]   and neither is anyone else in this room.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.520]   God knows us all.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.840]   A Different Spirit, will we repent?
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.120]   You know, the world has become indifferent to sin.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.640]   In fact, many have erased the concept altogether.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.200]   What people feel is right to do, to say, to think,
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.760]   that has become right.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.260]   I would say this indifference has crept into the church,
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.120]   but I don't think that's true.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.780]   I think it has boldly marched in and taken up residence.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.600]   We are indifferent because we've forgotten
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.400]   what sin invites into our lives,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.560]   what sin invites into our homes,
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.080]   our communities, our world.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.440]   Sin invites death.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.600]   In the story we've been looking at in this series,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.760]   A Different Spirit, we pick up the story
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.600]   from Numbers 14, verses 10 to 23.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.080]   And all the congregation said to stone them with stones,
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.960]   referring to Caleb and Joshua.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.480]   Now the glory of the Lord appeared
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.120]   in the tabernacle of meeting
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.800]   before all the children of Israel.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.560]   Then the Lord said to Moses,
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.940]   how long will these people reject me?
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.620]   And how long will they not believe me
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.480]   with all the signs which I have performed among them?
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.520]   I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.880]   and I will make of you a nation greater
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.560]   and mightier than they.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.320]   Moses said to the Lord,
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.840]   then the Egyptians will hear it,
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.280]   for by your might you brought these people up
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.160]   from among them,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.340]   and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.160]   They have heard that you, Lord, are among this people,
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.240]   that you, Lord, are seen face to face,
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.160]   and your cloud stands above them.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.000]   And you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.600]   and in a pillar of fire by night.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.000]   Now if you kill these people as one man,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   then the nations which have heard of your fame
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.600]   will speak, saying,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.960]   because the Lord was not able to bring this people
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.820]   to the land which he swore to them,
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.600]   therefore he killed them in the wilderness.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.680]   And now I pray,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.960]   let the power of my Lord be great,
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.920]   just as you have spoken,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.880]   saying the Lord is long-suffering and abundant in mercy,
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.260]   forgiving iniquity and transgression,
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.220]   but he by no means clears the guilty,
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.120]   visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.120]   to the third and fourth generation.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.220]   Pardon the iniquity of this people,
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.100]   I pray according to the greatness of your mercy,
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.880]   just as you have forgiven this people from Egypt
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.480]   even until now.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.060]   Then the Lord said,
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.040]   I have pardoned according to your word,
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.660]   but truly as I live,
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.260]   all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord,
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.660]   because all these men who have seen my glory
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.700]   and the signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.000]   and have put me to the test now these 10 times
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.260]   and have not heeded my voice,
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.060]   they certainly shall not see the land
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.560]   of which I swore to their fathers,
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.540]   nor shall any of those who rejected me see it.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.580]   The Israelite sin ultimately caused them to die trapped
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.900]   and wandering in a desert.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.700]   It also brought death to their promises,
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.380]   their dreams, their hopes.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.980]   Today many of us are wandering in a desert,
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:33.080]   stuck, frustrated, experiencing lost dreams,
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.380]   because we've invited sin into our lives.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.780]   We've not turned away from it,
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.580]   but instead have made room for it.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:48.660]   We've also become indifferent to the consequences of sin.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.240]   We say to ourselves, God will forgive me.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.740]   We go back to the same sin a second, a third, a fourth,
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.040]   a fifth time.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.860]   We tell ourselves, God will understand.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.800]   You know, the irony is, he does understand.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.040]   But what we often forget is that there are always
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.560]   consequences to sin, which we bear in our bodies,
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   our minds, our homes, our communities, and our world.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.040]   God forgave the children of Israel,
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.920]   but the consequences of their sin
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.880]   was that they lost their intended future.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.680]   They were literally on the doorstep of it,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.560]   but couldn't inherit it.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.040]   In Numbers 13, two, God says,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.960]   "Send men to spy out the land of Canaan,
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.300]   "which I am giving to the children of Israel."
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.960]   He says, "Which I am giving,"
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.920]   not that I'm thinking about giving.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.380]   He said that I am giving.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.380]   You know, when God first asked Moses
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.660]   to liberate the nation of Israel
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.660]   from the oppression of slavery in Egypt,
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.180]   God, Moses asked God,
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.300]   "What is your name?"
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.840]   He said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.800]   "and say to them, the God of your fathers
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.200]   "has sent me to you, and they ask me, what is your name?
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.880]   "Then what shall I tell them?"
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.960]   God says to Moses, "Ihir asher ihir,"
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.960]   I am who I am.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.120]   This is what you are to say to the Israelites,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.000]   I am has sent me to you.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.520]   The Hebrew alphabet gives a clue to the meaning.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.920]   This name begins with the first letter
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.320]   of the Hebrew alphabet, Aleph,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.960]   which speaks of the future tense.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.880]   Therefore, this name can be translated,
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.300]   I will be who I will be.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.700]   God is saying he's not only with us right now,
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.800]   but he goes ahead of us into our future,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.560]   which may be unknown to us,
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.660]   but is completely known to God.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.680]   God is saying, I will be whatever I choose to be
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.280]   in the circumstances you face in life,
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.640]   your healer, your deliverer, your provider, your protector,
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.080]   I will be that for you.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.600]   When God said, I am giving this land
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.200]   to the children of Israel,
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.720]   he was backing up his promise with his name,
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.120]   with the essence of who he was, with his character.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.040]   This is significant.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.920]   Let's look at what happens when the spies return
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.380]   from spying out the promised land.
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.940]   They share, we went to the land where you sent us,
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.420]   it truly flows with milk and honey.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.940]   But the people who dwell in the land are strong,
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.220]   the cities are fortified, and there's giants.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.020]   We are not able to go up against the people,
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.620]   they are stronger than us.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.980]   These spies give the children of Israel
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.460]   a bad report of the land,
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.100]   saying that the land devours its inhabitants,
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.300]   and we were like grasshoppers.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.420]   What just happened here?
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.580]   God said, I am giving this land to you.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:39.500]   The 10 spies say, we are not able, they are stronger.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.220]   These men were denying the word of God,
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.380]   the promises of God, they were denying God himself,
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.180]   his strength and his power.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.900]   They were saying, these people are stronger than us
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.820]   and our God.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.380]   God is not able to give us this land.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:02.300]   They lost sight of their own identity
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.980]   as the children of God,
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.420]   and they lost sight of God's identity.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.900]   I am.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.600]   They not only lost sight of it, they denied it.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.940]   They sinned by not trusting God's vision
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.340]   and rebelling against it.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.160]   When Caleb and Joshua tried to remind them
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.400]   of who they are and who God is,
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.260]   the Israelites don't even want to listen.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.480]   Numbers 14, 10 to 11.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.720]   And all the congregation said to stone them.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.620]   Now the glory of the Lord appeared
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.540]   in the tabernacle of meeting
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.260]   before all the children of Israel.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.880]   Then the Lord said to Moses,
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.980]   how long will these people reject me?
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.560]   How long will they not believe me
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.480]   with all the signs which I've performed among them?
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.220]   Furthermore, the 10 spies sin
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.520]   because they sway the whole community
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.880]   to reject God's words.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.620]   They sway them to lose sight of the grapes
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.380]   and only see the giants.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:17.540]   How much sin enters our lives
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.900]   because we lose sight of our identity and God?
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   And distrust God's words and deny his very character.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.100]   The other day I was going to catch the E41,
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.120]   which is the bus I take every morning to get to my school.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.460]   And if somebody had said to me that morning,
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.600]   look, when you get to your bus line,
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.360]   you're going to be second or third in line.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.020]   I would have said, great.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.560]   Because actually it doesn't matter
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.480]   where you are in the bus line,
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.100]   you always get a seat on that bus.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.320]   It's never full, there's always empty seats left over.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.200]   So as I approached the bus line that morning,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.480]   I noticed that there was one man lined up.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.660]   I was about five metres away from him,
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.640]   walking down the street towards him.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.200]   At the same time, I noticed that across the road
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.040]   on the other side of the road,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.300]   there was a woman who was heading to the bus line as well.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.560]   I recognised her as a regular traveller.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.240]   She was there every morning.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.140]   She was about 15 metres away from the bus line.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.600]   Now, if we continued as we were,
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.960]   I would have ended up second in the bus line
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.760]   and she would have ended up third in the bus line.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.900]   All good, right?
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.400]   Apparently not.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.560]   As she caught my eye, she began to run.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.000]   Now, she wasn't running to catch the bus,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.320]   it hadn't come yet.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.720]   She was running to be second in line.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.000]   Now, remember I said that if someone had told me
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.640]   that morning that I would be second or third in line,
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.920]   I would have said, "Great."
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.900]   But all of a sudden it mattered.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:13.000]   These were the strange thoughts that ran through my head.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.660]   She's trying to take second place from me.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.120]   Can't she see me?
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.600]   I'm right here.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.000]   Oh my goodness, she's running.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.180]   And then I thought, "Oh no you don't.
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.180]   Not on my watch."
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.980]   Now, thankfully I didn't break into a run.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.960]   I didn't want to be that obvious,
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.000]   but I hastened my pace.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.180]   The result was that at the exact same moment
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.160]   that this woman launched herself over the curb
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.960]   like she was finishing the 100 meter dash
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.760]   to take second place, I stepped around the man
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.280]   and slotted myself into second place,
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.320]   forcing the woman into third place.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.660]   It was a very uncomfortable moment.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.620]   There we were, the man, me, and the woman,
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.840]   shoulder to shoulder.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.200]   No social distancing.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.400]   I could feel the heat from her stare.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.080]   And I do what everyone does,
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.380]   I buried myself in my iPhone.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.640]   When I boarded the bus and sat down,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.680]   I started to think about what had just happened.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.560]   I hadn't cared about my order in the bus line,
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.600]   and then I had cared, so much so that I'd acted
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.040]   irrationally and embarrassed myself.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.560]   What had happened?
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.960]   I realized that I'd interpreted this woman's motivations.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.860]   I felt like she was saying, "I'm more important than you.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.760]   "You aren't valuable.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.300]   "I'm choosing to place myself ahead of you."
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.760]   Did the woman really think these things about me?
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.680]   Probably not.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.240]   She just really wanted to be second that day.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.620]   What drove her to it, I have no idea.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.620]   But then I examined myself, why had I reacted this way?
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.900]   The woman didn't know it,
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.720]   but her actions attacked my identity.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.600]   Instead of me realizing that her actions said nothing
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.700]   about my true worth and value,
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.060]   I lost sight of my true identity in God,
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.060]   and I reverted to my past one.
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.340]   Put up for adoption, unwanted,
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.700]   not valuable enough to be kept.
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.360]   In that moment at the bus line, I was proving myself,
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.280]   showing that I was good enough to be in second place,
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.820]   shouting loudly inside, "I am valuable."
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.540]   In that moment, my actions denied
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.340]   everything God has spoken over my life.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.420]   God has already shown me who I truly am.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.800]   I didn't need to prove my worth.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:24.100]   He's already shown me who I truly am in his eyes.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:29.380]   I sinned against that woman that day.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.840]   I didn't love her as myself.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.020]   I placed myself above her,
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.440]   and in my thoughts, I judged her.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.020]   I also dishonored God.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:45.520]   How do you see yourself?
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.840]   Do you believe what God says about you?
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.580]   God called the Israelites conquerors.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.620]   He said, "I am giving you this land.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.140]   "You will conquer it."
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.020]   When the Israelites lost sight of who they were in God
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:09.020]   and who God was, they saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.100]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.620]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.820]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.420]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.620]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.660]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.620]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.060]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.580]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.780]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.220]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.420]   They saw themselves as grasshoppers.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.260]   I'm not a good enough Christian.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.680]   You know, who would really miss me if I wasn't here?
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.580]   I'm a failure.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.780]   God doesn't show up for me.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.300]   He shows up for them.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.340]   He doesn't show up for me.
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.140]   I don't think he cares about me.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:05.700]   In this area of identity, the way we see ourselves,
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.420]   the way we see God, I believe many of us
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.580]   need to seek repentance and healing.
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.860]   Trusting in God's character,
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.620]   trusting in the truth of his words,
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.920]   and knowing your identity in God
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.560]   is vital to living with a different spirit.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:33.820]   If we don't, if we aren't secure in our identity,
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.940]   or we don't truly know who God is and trust him,
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.220]   we will act irrationally.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.660]   We will fight to be seen.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:49.300]   We will prove ourselves over and over again.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.860]   We will push ourselves in front of others.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.940]   We will hurt ourselves,
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.100]   and we will hurt the people around us.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.540]   Not only do the 10 spies sin
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.580]   by allowing the fear of the giants
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.540]   to determine how they saw themselves,
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.900]   and ultimately disbelieve the promised provision of God,
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.860]   they cause the whole congregation of Israelites
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.760]   to follow them in their sin.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.580]   They sway them with their words.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.840]   You see, words are powerful.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.820]   There are people sitting here today,
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.980]   and you have been damaged by words.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.140]   They still come back into your memory,
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.380]   things that have been said over you.
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:43.800]   Words are powerful.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.540]   The 10 spies' words shift the Israelites' gaze
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.020]   from a land flowing with milk and honey
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.040]   to a land flowing with oppression and slavery.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.280]   Sin invites death.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.960]   Look at what the people begin to say.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.640]   If only we had died in the land of Egypt,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.100]   or if only we had died in this wilderness,
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.600]   why has the Lord brought us to the land
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.340]   to fall by the sword,
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.500]   that our wives and children should become victims?
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.300]   Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.000]   They start speaking about death.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.340]   They start speaking of returning to a place
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.700]   where they were oppressed,
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.320]   where many of them had suffered and died.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.400]   They begin speaking the very opposite of God's promise.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.860]   Why has the Lord brought us to this land,
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.520]   not to give it to us,
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.980]   but that we would fall by the sword?
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:51.180]   How are we using our words?
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.840]   A person with a different spirit
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.020]   will always use their words to help people see God
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.580]   and their future with Him.
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.760]   A person with a different spirit
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.080]   will use their words to build people up,
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.720]   to encourage,
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.800]   to strengthen.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.560]   Caleb and Joshua say,
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   "The land we pass through and explored is exceedingly good.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.200]   "If the Lord is pleased with us,
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.720]   "He will lead us into this land,
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.080]   "a land flowing with milk and honey,
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.380]   "and He will give it to us."
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:36.160]   In this season of your life, this season in Hong Kong,
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.880]   what are your words bringing?
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.040]   Are they bringing life?
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.600]   Or are they bringing death?
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:50.260]   Are your words swaying people to give in to fear?
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.600]   Or are they encouraging people to lean into their faith
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.500]   and trust in God's presence?
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:05.000]   The Israelites were doubting God's love for them.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.360]   They were doubting that He would protect them.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.700]   They lost sight of their future.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.800]   They lost sight of their future in God,
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.700]   and they were staring back at their past.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.880]   Are we doubting our future?
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.080]   Are we doubting our identity, our value in God?
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.800]   The landscape of Hong Kong has changed, and it is changing.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:37.040]   Are we looking at the future with a trust in who God is,
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.840]   remembering His great love for us,
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.120]   or have the giants got us longing for the past?
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.540]   Do we need to repent?
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:55.380]   If sin invites death, repentance invites life.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:01.900]   In the Bible, God calls us to repent and live.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.380]   Repentance is the key to life.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.500]   It unlocks the door to fullness of life.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.220]   So what is repentance?
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.940]   Repentance.
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.940]   If the wages of sin is death,
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.960]   but repentance can undo this, what is it?
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:32.400]   Repentance is a personal, between you and God.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.760]   It's a personal and absolute, unconditional surrender
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.700]   to God as sovereign.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.420]   Though it includes asking for forgiveness
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.340]   and having genuine sorrow and regret,
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.300]   it is more than that.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:59.180]   In repenting, one makes a complete change of direction,
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:04.820]   180-degree turn toward God.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:10.780]   It is choosing to follow after God with all your heart.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.120]   Repentance is an act of faith.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.620]   Caleb had a different spirit.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.840]   Look at what God says about him.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.500]   But my servant Caleb,
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.860]   because he has a different spirit in him
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.820]   and has followed me fully,
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.860]   I will bring him to the land where he went
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.120]   and his descendants shall inherit it.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:39.120]   He has followed me fully.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.640]   True repentance is not a one-time thing.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.140]   It is a daily following after Jesus.
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:55.020]   I would say that we need to adopt a lifestyle of repentance,
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:26:01.200]   a lifestyle of turning back to God fully every day,
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.140]   a lifestyle of complete surrender,
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:11.060]   and a lifestyle of heeding God's voice.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:17.060]   To have a different spirit, we have to follow God fully.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.720]   This starts with an awakening to the sin in our life
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.880]   that we've become indifferent to.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.140]   We then surrender to God
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:35.480]   and turn completely away from the sin.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.900]   We need to understand what it costs God
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.940]   to be able to forgive us.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:48.100]   It costs him watching his son be nailed to a tree.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:53.740]   This was not the first time the people of Israel
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.580]   had sinned and disobeyed God's voice.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.020]   God says 10 times they've not heeded my voice.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:07.820]   When we like the Israelites keep returning to sin,
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.820]   keep inviting the same sin into our lives,
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:15.260]   turning our back on the plans that God has for us,
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.620]   the Bible describes it like this.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:25.420]   They again nail the Son of God on the cross.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.440]   For as far as they are concerned,
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.860]   they are treating the death of Christ
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.140]   as if they were not saved by it
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:40.820]   and are holding him up again to public disgrace.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:46.360]   When I read that, I started to cry.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.840]   I was really convicted by it.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:56.080]   And I asked myself, have I been picking up
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.660]   those nine inch long nails,
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.300]   pushing Jesus back onto the cross
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.460]   and banging the nails in with my thoughts and my actions?
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:19.300]   As I was preparing the sermon, I felt God say,
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.500]   following, not walking.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.840]   I didn't understand.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.060]   So I asked him to explain what it was
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.460]   he was trying to tell me.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.540]   He said, generally walking in a direction
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.780]   is different to intentionally following
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.340]   in someone's footsteps.
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.700]   Jesus said, follow me.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:50.060]   To follow someone, you have to see them.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.740]   You have to stay close.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.980]   Caleb had a different spirit.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.060]   He was following God fully.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.860]   Too many of us have been following
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.700]   in the general direction of Christ
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.620]   and we've lost sight of him.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.460]   We are no longer close to him.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:17.520]   Repentance keeps us close.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.480]   True repentance is turning away from sin
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.940]   and turning towards God's words for our life,
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.300]   aligning ourselves with what God says about us,
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.000]   choosing to trust in the nature and character of God.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.300]   Repentance isn't just seeking forgiveness,
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.300]   but it is that as well.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.180]   It's not just turning away from sin,
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.740]   but it is that as well.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.380]   It is then choosing to move in Jesus' direction,
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.140]   following in his footsteps.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.140]   Will we repent?
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:02.420]   I'd like to invite the musicians back.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.800]   Would you stand with me?
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.600]   We're just gonna take some time at the end of this service
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.560]   to heed God's voice,
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:36.300]   to listen, to hear what he wants us to repent of.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:42.740]   We have all fallen short.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.020]   There is no one in this room
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.140]   who isn't in need of repentance.
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.400]   There's just not one.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.920]   We have all fallen short.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:59.880]   I just wanna remind people here today
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.080]   that sin isn't just the things that we do.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.060]   Sin is also the things that we don't do,
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.960]   the things that we know to be right,
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.960]   the things God has called us to, but we don't.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.480]   Just close your eyes
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:26.360]   and open your hands in front of you.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:33.440]   On the way here, I heard a beautiful song,
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:38.440]   and it said, "I don't wanna miss one word you speak,
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.040]   "'cause everything you say is life to me.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:47.620]   "I don't want to miss one word you speak.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.840]   "Quiet my heart, I'm listening."
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.940]   I wanna encourage you to listen.
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.880]   God is speaking to you.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.900]   He's speaking to me.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.720]   Listen.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.420]   Still the noise in your head.
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:16.280]   Take this moment to be still in his presence.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.920]   (gentle music)
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.760]   Listen.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.440]   Hear what he is saying to you.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.840]   Some of you today, you know
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.160]   that how you think about yourself
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.640]   and some of the things you think about God,
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.480]   you know they're not right,
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.520]   and God is challenging you to repent.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.440]   Some of you today,
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.920]   you know the words that have been coming out
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.360]   of your mouth have not been bringing life,
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.640]   not to you, not to the people who hear you,
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.080]   not to the people in your workplace,
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.040]   not to the people in your family,
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.280]   and God is challenging you to repent.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.680]   Some of you today, you're so fearful of the future.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:14.120]   You've lost sight of the hugeness of God,
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.200]   of his power and his strength.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.600]   You've lost sight of your own future,
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.920]   and God would say, "Come, come close.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.440]   "Let me restore you.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.720]   "Let me help you to see again."
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:38.600]   Some of you today, you know you've been inviting sin
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.440]   into your life.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.040]   You've gone back a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth time.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.000]   God's heart is breaking.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.440]   He says, "Come, come, let me help you to turn away from it,
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:58.800]   "to walk away from it."
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.400]   (gentle music)
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.980]   (gentle music)
