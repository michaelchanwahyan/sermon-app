[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Imagine with me for a moment, a church.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   This is not a church in the singular, on its own and distinct,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   but a church in the plural, united across a nation, joined in purpose,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   focused on building up God's kingdom, one life at a time.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story brings.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   A church that sees salvation as holistic,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   transforming God's people for God's work,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   and equipping a generation to represent God's heart
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Imagine this church committed to seeing the family as integral
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   to all that it's called to be and do,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   involving intentional, committed, and authentic relationships across all levels.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It is the sort of place where both the young and the old feel cared for,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   supported and equipped.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions come to feel at home,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   a cultural mosaic that honors and embraces a richness in diversity
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   that marks us as the body of Christ.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   rooted in God's Word and driven with prayer.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   A church that does not make its Sunday services the exclamation mark of its existence,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   a time of service, love, and engagement
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   that inspires and emboldens all equally for the conversation that lies ahead.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   This is our city.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   This is our church.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   This is our home.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Good morning everyone. How are you doing?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It's one week to Christmas and you see the weather, it's finally right.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   We're finally in the right kind of weather, right?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Yeah, okay. Some of you enjoy it, I can see a few of you.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   The others are like, "Oh, it's too cold, it's too cold."
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   So if you feel it's too cold today, I hope you would enjoy the embrace of God in the house here today.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   All right, why don't we stand? Let's stand.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And all of you standing in the back, are you gonna like come and grab a seat?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Oh, okay. Anyway, we love you very much.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   But we're here to worship Jesus today. I'm so excited you're all here.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   We're gonna pray into this.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Like, "Oh, come all you faithful," right? Why don't we pray?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Father, we welcome your presence in this house today, Lord God.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   We are so excited that we get together as a church after a week apart.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And God, we just pray that today as we sing to you, as we worship you,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I pray that our focus will be solely fixed on you, Jesus.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   There's so much we brought here with us today.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   But God, today as we celebrate the season of Christmas, we want to be reminded once again, Lord God,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   we want our hearts to be turned to you.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So come, Lord, I pray that you would grab attention here in this house today.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Lord, let this time we will sing as we sing to you, Jesus.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Let we just spend time with you, focus on you.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Let us lay down everything else before you.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   God, we're here for you, and we're ready for you, Lord.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   In Jesus' name, everybody say.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   [Music]
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   O come.

[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Come and behold him, born the King of angels.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   O come, let us adore him.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   O come, let us adore him.

[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   [Music]
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   O sing, all ye citizens of heaven above.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Glory to God, glory in the highest.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   O come, let us adore him.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   O come, let us adore him.

[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   [Music]
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Yeah, Lord, we greet thee.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Born this happy morning, Jesus, to thee be all glory given.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Word of the Father, now in fresh appearing.

[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   We'll praise your name.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   We'll praise your name forever.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   We'll praise your name forever.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   We'll praise your name forever.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Christ the Lord.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   One more time.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   We'll praise your name forever.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   We'll praise your name forever.

[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Christ the Lord.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   O come, let us adore him.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   O come, let us adore him.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   [MUSIC - "I'M NOT GOING TO DIE"]
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   [MUSIC - "I'M NOT GOING TO DIE"]
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   [MUSIC - "I'M NOT GOING TO DIE"]
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   O holy night, the stars are brightly shining.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Long lay the world in sin and error pining
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   till he appeared and the soul felt his word.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Fall on your knees.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Oh, hear the angel voices.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Oh, night divine.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Oh, night when Christ was born.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Oh, night divine.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Oh, night, oh, night divine.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Truly, truly he taught us to love one another.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   His law is love and his gospel is peace.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Chain he should break for the slave is our brother.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And in his name all oppression shall cease its guide.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Let all within us praise his holy name.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Christ is the Lord.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Yes, you are.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   All praise his name forever.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   His power and glory evermore proclaim.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   His power and glory evermore proclaim.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Fall on your knees.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Fall on your knees.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Oh, hear the angel voices.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Oh, night divine.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Oh, night when Christ was born.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Oh, night divine.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Oh, night, oh, night divine.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Oh, night divine.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   >> I love that song.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   It's a Christmas song.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   But it sings about God's goodness to us and his love
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   towards us.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   What better way did he show us that than when he came.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   So, yeah, let's just worship him.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Amazing love.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Amazing love.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Amazing love.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Amazing love.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Amazing love.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   God, you're so good.

[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Behold the cross.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Age to age.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   And hour by hour.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   The dead are raised.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   The sinner saved.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   The work of your power.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   You're so good to me.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Yes, you're so good.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   You're so good to me.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I am blessed.

[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Fill with your power all the glory in Jesus' name.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I am blessed.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   I am called.

[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   And should this life bring suffering, Lord, I will remember.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   What Calvary has bought for me, both now and forever.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   You're so good to me.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   You're so good to me.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I am blessed.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I am blessed.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I am called.

[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   I am saved in Jesus' name.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Highly favored, anointed.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Fill with your power all the glory in Jesus' name.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I am blessed.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   I am called.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   I am healed.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   I am whole.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I am saved in Jesus' name.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Highly favored, anointed.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Fill with your power all the glory in Jesus' name.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Last time, God, you're so good.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   It's a lot.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   You're so good to me.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   I'm just wondering as we were singing, when we say these words
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   or when we sing these words, God is good, you're so good to me.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   I just want to do a survey here in this room.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   You can open your eyes right now.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   If these words, God is good or God is good to me,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   if that means something to you personally,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   can I have your hands raised all across this room?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   All right.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Okay, let's keep your hand up there.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Let's keep your hand up there.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   So this is personal to you, I assume, right?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Because you said that means something to me personally.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   If that's the truth, then what I want to do is we're going to sing
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   God is good one more time, and I want you to mean it like this is
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   personal to me.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   God, you're just so good to me, to me.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I love you, God, because you're so good to me,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   and I'm here to sing this praise to you.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   I'm here to worship you today because you are good.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Can we do this, church?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Can we do this one more time?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Let's do this.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Let's worship him all across this house.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Come on, church.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Let's give it up this place.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Let's do it.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Let's sing this, church.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   You're so good to me.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   You're so good to me.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   God, you're so good.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   You're so good to me.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   God, I thank you.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   You're so good, and your goodness has nothing to do with us.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Your goodness has nothing to do with how good we are.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Your goodness has nothing to do with how much we've done to earn it.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   God, you're just so good for who you are, and we praise you for that.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   We love you, God.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   We worship you today because you are just so good.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   With or without us, you are good forever.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Yesterday, today, you are the same.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   You are just that very, very good God, and we praise you, Lord.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   You are so good that when we are not good enough, you are not here to punish us,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   but you send your only son to die for us on the cross.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   So, God, forever, you deserve our praise.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   You deserve our worship, Lord God, and we're here to give you that praise and worship, Lord.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   We praise you.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   We thank you, Jesus.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   We love you.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   In your name we pray, and everybody say, "Amen."
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   All right.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Let's give it up to God, all right?
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   All right, now, we could be seated, but if you were here in the last couple of weeks,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   you know that this is Advent, and you see these beautiful candles in front of the stage.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Our worship has not ended yet.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   While we're seated, we are going to continue to worship God with something called liturgy.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   That is something that has been passed down for years or centuries in the church.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   So what we're going to do is every week we're reading some scriptures.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Someone is going to come up and lead us in a moment, and we have these candles that represent
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   hope, love, peace, and joy, and we're lighting it each week.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   So this week we have Deborah coming to lead us to read the liturgy, and also we'll be praying in a moment.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   So thank you, Deborah.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Jesus said, "I am the light of the world.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   The one who follows me will not walk in darkness, but have the light of life."
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   We'll light this candle as a sign of the coming light of Christ.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   [Lighting the candle]
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   We're praying for the fire of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Like I sometimes need to be shaken up before the fire could be released.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Okay.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Ah, it's coming.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Thank you for your prayer.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Why don't we continue.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Come, Lord Jesus, our light and life.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Until that day, let us walk in the light of the Lord.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Why don't we pray together, and thank you, Deborah.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   God, we thank you so much because you are that light, because you are here to bring light to us.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   So, God, I just pray as we are entering into this season of Christmas, God, I just pray that if there's still darkness in us,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   we pray that you would release your light in those areas of our lives.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   And may we continue to put our focus on you each day as we go about life.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Amen.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Amen.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Thank you.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   So, right now, we just want to say hello to some of us here who come for the very first time.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   If this is the first time you come and join a service, we would love to say hello to you.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   You could just let us know where you are, and we would love to give you a warm welcome.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Hi.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And you could also scan this QR code on the screen, and there's a very short form just to leave some basic information with us,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   and we will stay in touch with you.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   So, the code is there.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And today we are very happy because we have some special friends joining us.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   They came all the way from the United States or Hawaii.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   It's the YWAM team.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   They're here to lead our children today in K4C.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   So, why don't we also stretch out our hands to pray for our children.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   God, we thank you for children.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Thank you.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   They remind us so many things.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   They remind us of simple faith and a lot of things in our lives.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   But, God, today we want to pray for them.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   We want to bless them that they will continue to encounter you at K4C.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   I pray for the team.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I pray for our children.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I pray for a wonderful time for them today in Jesus' name.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Amen.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   All right, parents, you know where to go.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Zero to two at the back, three to five, or six to 12 over there on that side.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   If you're here staying here, why don't you turn to your neighbors and just share a few things with them.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   How's your week so far?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Like, let's have a chat with someone.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   [Music]
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   [Music]
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   [Music]
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   [Music]
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   [Music]
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   [Music]
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   [Music]
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Awesome, awesome.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Totally feeling the season so far, huh?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Great.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   As usual, we have a couple of announcements for you.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And we'll start with this coming Tuesday.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   We have a prayer meeting.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Actually, it's a monthly prayer meeting.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   We're having it every month on one of the Tuesdays.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   And it's in person.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   So it will happen here.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   The slide is coming up in the back.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   It starts at 8 p.m.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I almost wanted to say a.m., but we start at 8 p.m.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   So grab dinner and then come join us to pray, not just for ourselves or our church, but also pray for the community around us or the city we're in.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And then on the 25th, that's next -- what do you call it?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Not next Monday.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Do you call it next Monday?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Anyway, okay.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   You know next Sunday we have the Christmas Eve service?
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   But then on the 25th, like we've said before, we have the Christmas service.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   So 9.30 and 11.30 a.m. as usual.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   We'll see you there.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   We love to see you there.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   And after service, we have the cookie feast.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   And, yeah, so anybody else you can bake or you love cookies?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   No, none of you?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   I don't believe it.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   I know you're all secret cookies lovers.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Or, you know, we don't have to just eat cookies.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   You can bring in whatever, like from bakery, whatever pastries, whatever you love, we can bring and share.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   It's the spirit of the season to really share.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Nobody should spend Christmas alone.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Amen?
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Yes.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Okay, now enough feasting.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   I have something else to talk to you about.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   After feasting, after this whole season, in January, every year at the Vine, we do a churchwide annual fast.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   That is next year or next month.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   We start in January on the 8th all the way until 28th.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   It's about 21 days.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   And if you are asking the question, oh, why are we fasting?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   I do want to tell you that, you know, fasting has been something that Christians have been doing for centuries.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   You know, Jesus taught his disciples.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   When he taught his disciples, Jesus didn't say, "If you fast."
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Jesus says, "When you fast."
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   It means he assumes his disciples are doing it on a regular basis.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And if you're not doing that on a regular basis, it's okay.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   We still love you.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Jesus still loves you.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   But it's also a very great spiritual practice for us to start or to try.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And don't worry.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   It doesn't mean you're not going to eat for 21 days.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   It's not like that.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   There are many, many different ways to fast.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Complete or full fast is just one of the many ways.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Some people choose a partial fast.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Somebody does something like, what do you call it, a Daniel fast.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   For 21 days, they have a certain diet.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   They avoid certain things.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   So the main thing, it's not about what you eat or what you don't eat.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   It's about refocusing on God.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   It's about, you know, putting your focus less on yourself, less on what you want,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   less on what you need, but put your focus on God and say,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   "God, I want to humble myself before you.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   I want to tune in so that I can listen to your voice even more.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   And we want to worship you even more."
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And we're not just doing it as individuals.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   We're doing it as a church.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   We see stories after stories in the Bible when God's people join together in a fast.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   God will speak to them.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   God will do amazing things in them.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And at the beginning of the year, that's what we want to do.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   We say, "God, we want to dedicate this whole year to you."
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   And this is a posture.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   We want to come into a time of fasting to seek you together.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And again, food is just one of the many things you can fast.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Nowadays, there are so many things that are fighting for attention,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   that are stealing our attention from God.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And maybe perhaps you know what those things are for you,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   and those are the things that you can lay down for 21 days for Jesus.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Social media has been one of the very popular options recently.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   I'm not saying that you have to do it, but that's just one of the examples that I can give you.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   And so as we are feasting in the next couple of weeks,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   you can spend some time in your quiet time.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   "God, what would you like me to fast in January?"
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   That's a good time to think about it as well.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   In the next couple of weeks, we'll give you more updates about this.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Are you good? Okay.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Yeah? Hungry? That's okay.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Yeah, let's go and eat a feast before we start the fasting.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   But yeah, so now we're going to continue our worship with our offering.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   As volunteers, our welcome team are passing down the buckets.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   If you're using cash or checks, you may grab one of those envelopes on the seat,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   and you can write on them so you could get the tax receipt.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Or if you're using any digital means, they're all on the wall.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   QR code, scan it.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   We all are very used to it nowadays.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   It's such a beautiful time in Christmas, remembering when we give,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   when we're thinking what we can offer God,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   that we remember God has offered us his one and only son here to come on earth,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   to go through all the mess, right?
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   We're having this sermon series called "Christmas,"
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   and we're going to be going through all the mess, going through all the trouble,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and to die for us on the cross, a very horrible death,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   so that we could be with him, so that we can experience his generosity.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   So that's what this season is all about.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   So let's respond to that kind of generosity in our worship, in our offering.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Why don't we pray together?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Father, we thank you for your generosity, your ultimate generosity.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   You gave your one and only son.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   God, we know we can never outgive you, and we celebrate that.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   We celebrate the fact that we have a good, good father, a generous father.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   We know everything we need in our life, you already knew before we even asked.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   So God, today, as we come here, this is not just an act of generosity.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   This is an act of faith, knowing that as we put in these resources,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   as we give them back to you, as we put these in the buckets
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   or through online or whatever way, God, we know, first of all,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   you will continue to be our provider.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And we also know that you are going to multiply these resources
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   to bless so many other people around us.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   So God, we just pray your kingdom come.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   We pray that you will continue to grow that kingdom on earth
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   through our small partnership with you.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   God, we thank you, we love you.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Now, I am so excited to welcome to the stage our friend June.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   She is going to bring the message to us today.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   And where do you want me to put this?
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   It's here, it'll be fine.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Why don't we stretch out our hands and let's pray for June.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   God, we realize in the last couple of weeks as we talk about this Christmas,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   a lot of us, we are also sharing the mess in our lives as well.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   But Father, we know in our stories, in the story of the Bible,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   we saw how you always act and work in our midst.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   And so, yeah, Father, we just pray that today this mess we are sharing
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   will become a message in our lives.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   We just pray you would release your word in and through June
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   and to bless our hearts to change our lives.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Thank you, Chapman.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Welcome to Divine Yuen Long and let me introduce myself.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   I'm June. I'm one of the staff here.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Normally, well, actually my role is to look after the family and kids ministry.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And I'm honored today to share my story with you today.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   So, when I was young, well, actually right now,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   I don't really celebrate my birthdays because it fall on a festive day.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   And people are already having parties and stuff like that.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   So, I'm happily crashing their parties and make it my birthday party.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   And just to have fun and, you know, celebrate together.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   But one of the reasons why that is because, obviously,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   it was a festive day and people are already celebrating.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But another reason is that it might be because of one of the stories
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   that I had when I was young.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   So, when I was young, I'm not a very sociable person.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   I don't have a lot of friends. I have very low social skills.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And so, when I was in third grade, I already don't have a lot of friends.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   So, I decided this year I'm going to have my first ever birthday party.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   I'm going to invite the many numbers of friends that I have at school
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   and my cousins to come to my place and just have a good time.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   They don't know each other because some were from my home,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   some were from school, you know, they were in different parts of my life.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   But, you know, I don't know if they planned it together.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   One by one, they started to cancel on me on the day of the birthday party.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   So, at that time, I was heartbroken.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   I just sleep it off pretending nothing has happened.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   But actually, what I was feeling was rejection.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   And I didn't know it at that time.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   But as I grow, I realize that rejection is everyone's story.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   No matter you are a few months old or you are 900 years old,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   it is something that we have to go through every day.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Maybe you start your rejection getting rejected
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   when you want to go to someone's home and your parents said no.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Maybe you were rejected because you want to sleep at 10 o'clock tonight
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   and your parents said no.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Maybe you were rejected when you proposed to someone,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   maybe for your visa application.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   There are many opportunities where we would put ourselves out there
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   to be vulnerable and what we received was a rejection.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   Some rejections are easy to let go.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Sometimes we can just move on with our life easily.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   But there are emotions that are hard to let go.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   It's not because those are big incidents,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   those are big things that it's very hard to let go.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Sometimes they are just tiny things.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   But when we get rejected,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   it's not that they are rejecting the incident itself.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   It felt like they are rejecting me.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Me as a person and my worth and my worth to be at a certain place.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   The passage that we are looking at today
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   is about the story of Jesus being born in Bethlehem.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Unlike the perfect and simplified version of a children's nativity play,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   the details of the Christmas story actually revealed God's heart for us.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   How is that connected to my story of rejection?
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   When the angels and the hosts all celebrate and sing together
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   when Jesus was born,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   how can it connect that to my story of rejection?
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   So let's have a look at today's scripture together.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   It's from Luke 2, verse 1-5.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   That was the first census that took place
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   And everyone went to their own town to register.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   to Bethlehem, the town of David,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   because he belonged to the house and line of David.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   The story begins by setting the time, character, and location.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Luke not only describes the birth of Jesus,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   but also connects that with a historical event.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   The Roman Empire was ruling over Israel,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   and that with one degree, the whole world,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   meaning the whole Roman Empire,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   had to pack their bags and go and return to where they belonged to.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   So regardless of their social status
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   or what was going on with their life, they all had to go.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   So Joseph and Mary set off to their journey,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   and the journey described in the passage was not a short one.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   It would have taken approximately three weeks.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   So because if you look at it in the map,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   it would be a straight line from Nazareth to Bethlehem.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   But however, they couldn't go through Syria.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   They had to detour a little somewhere.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   So that actually took around three weeks.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   And not only that, the danger and the trouble of traveling so far
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   was actually really tough for both of them.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Well, I got a chance to visit Israel in August,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   and I had experience of hiking, you know,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   at the outskirt of the desert of Judea,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   and I actually hiked with my life,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   as if actually my life depended on it as I hiked,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   because it was so hard and so difficult and so treacherous.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   I remember as I-- normally when I hike,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   I would follow the guide very closely,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   because if I don't, I would get lost.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   I would not know my way around the world.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   But at that time, when I hike, I let go of the guide.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   I let go of the whole group.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   I'm just trying to stay alive.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   I had my water bottle with me.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   I'm holding it as if I'm holding my baby,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   and I just try to keep up and try to stay alive.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   And actually the hike was easy--
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   was hard for young individuals like you and I.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   But imagine, Mary at that time, she was pregnant,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   and had to travel from one place to another.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   And of course, there were many debates
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   over whether they start their journey in summer or winter.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   And probably most of the time, most of the debate,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   they were leaning towards winter.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   So they don't have to deal with the scorching heat
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   or the temperature, but what they had to deal with
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   was the extreme temperature differences,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   what they had to deal with was the rocks and the burglars
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   that were hiding and they were trying to overtake
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   or try to rob the passerbys.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   And there were lots of dangers along the way.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   In addition to their personal pressures,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Mary had to carry the burden of being an unwed woman
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   from the very beginning.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Throughout those nine months,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   she likely to face a lot of gossips and accusations.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   They faced disbelief and judgment and rejection
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   from those who doubt the story.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   The accumulated stress during those months
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   must have been overwhelming.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   They might have originally hoped for a quiet and private birth,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   but their plan didn't go expected.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   In the midst of all these pressures,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   they had to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   and with Mary physically pregnant and unable to hide it.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   Can you imagine what went through Mary's head?
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Maybe she would have thought,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   "God, didn't you told me the plan?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   "Didn't you get me, you know, the Holy Spirit,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   "pregnant me with a baby?
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   "Isn't it your dream?
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   "Give me the dream and vision for me to carry it for you?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   "Didn't you also said it to your husband
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   "that not to be afraid?
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   "How can your dream and your vision coming down like this,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   "into this mess like this?
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   "Aren't you the wonderful God who could help me
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   "and prepare everything for me that you gave me this vision
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   "and now everything seems to be a mess?
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   "How could this be?"
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   I don't know if you resonate with what Mary had experienced.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Maybe God has given you a dream or a vision
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   or something to work toward,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   but in the middle of it, it gets so messy
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   that you doubt if it ever going to happen
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   and doubt if God ever had spoken to you like that.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   But one of the things that this mess
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   was actually planned by God.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   We in our limitation can only see so far,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   but God with his unlimited resource,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   unlimited vision can see past our mess.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   This mess was intended so that we could experience him.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   It is not that the mess was something out of God's control.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   It is a mess that was planned so that we could experience God.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   So let's keep on looking at the next passage.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   From Luke chapter 2, 6 to 7.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   "And while they were there, a time came for her to give birth.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   "And she gave birth to her firstborn
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   "and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him on a manger,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   "because there was no place for them to be in the inn,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   "because there was no place for them in the inn."
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Having no place is a remarkable statement.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Why was there no place?
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Did Joseph not book a room in advance?
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Was there no hotel?
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Did he try Airbnb?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   He should. It's quite useful.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   However, as we mentioned earlier,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Joseph and Mary was not going on a trip.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   They were not travelling.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   They had to go back to where Josh Joseph came from,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   that going back to where he came from.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   And so it would probably be going back to his family,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   to his relatives, to his uncle and aunt,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   probably someone that he know.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   And so when they travelled back to Bethlehem,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   they would not go for an inn.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   They would not go for someone they don't know.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   They would have expected to go back to their family.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   They would have expected their family to open up their arms,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   to embrace them completely,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   especially for Mary,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   that she has been pregnant and is about to give birth.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   She would have anticipated a place
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   where the family would welcome her in
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   and just give her a place to stay
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   and to give birth in a safe environment.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   However, as Joseph going door to door,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   asking for a room and they say no,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   it was not because of the only innkeeper that was heartless.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   It was actually the community of where Joseph was from.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   And to add on to that,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   they did not just reject two healthy individuals.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   They were rejecting a woman who was about to give birth.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   If there are mothers and fathers in the room,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   if you've experienced the hectic and the nervousness
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   of your spouse giving birth,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   it would be hard to imagine
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   that when Joseph had to take Mary door to door
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   and all the answers was a no.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   No, you cannot stay here.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   No, even if giving birth is a life and death event,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   we will not make room for you.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   That you have to give birth where animals eat.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   The first Christmas is not of a picture perfect one.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   It was one about rejection.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   The saviour of the world was not welcomed at the beginning.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   No one was willing to make room for Mary to give birth to Jesus.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   And his rejection didn't stop there.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Time and time again, people rejected him.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   The Jews cast stones at him.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   The Christians at him.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   People at his hometown tried to throw him off the cliff.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   The religious leaders criticized him
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   because he hung out with the wrong people.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   He hung out with sinners and with people of the margins.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   His own disciples who followed him,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   who saw all his great acts,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   who had been loved by Jesus,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   one self-sought him out
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   and the other refused to acknowledge him, to know him.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   His friends, his family and religious leaders all rejected him.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Even ourselves.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Before we started to accept Jesus,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   we ourselves have rejected him.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   We did not regard him as our saviour.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   We tried to fix our lives with our own ways,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   hurting others and ourselves along the way.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Even now, when we have become Christians,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   we will fall into rejecting him when we kept him at bay,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   hiding from him, not acknowledging his sovereignty over us.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   Jesus fully understands the pain of being rejected,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   the hurt of not being recognized or heard,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   the isolation, the shame of not being included.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   He fully understands it.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   And that's why I know that he can fully understand me.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   I'm an only child and from a young age,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   I learned my social skills through observation.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   But instead of learning how to make friends,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   my mind started to collect evidence
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   of why people wouldn't want to be friends with me.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   My parents at that time were busy with work
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   and communication or affirmation was not their priority.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   And so all these have created a wall between me and people.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   I could think of a million ways or a million thoughts about me
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   why people wouldn't hang out with me or give me that opportunity.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   In my head, there were reasons why I'm not loved.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   In order not to be rejected, I reject other people.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   I start to collect evidence of why people wouldn't want to include me.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   So before I go for that position or I try to reach out to those people
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   or I try to join in that activity,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   I would think of reasons why I shouldn't do that.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   And I say, "Jun, you cannot do that.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   You are not accepted. You will not be loved.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Let's stay where you are."
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   And so with all these experiences and rejections,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   a rejection at myself and rejection at other people,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   I put that with my experience with my God.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   I project what I've experienced to how God would have loved me as well.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   I know that God loves everyone unconditionally, but then...
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   But then...
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   I know that God would love me, but how could He love me if I have all these faults?
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   I know God would love me, but He would love the good part of me.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   Let me fix my fault first.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   Let me fix my failures first.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   He would love this good part of me.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   And the parts that I have rejected myself, I'm just going to hide.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   I'm just going to stay where I am.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   And so for the longest time, I did not experience the love of God.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Because of how I've experienced my love in this world.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   I find that as I've rejected myself,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   I have rejected others' love for me and God's love for me.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   And because of rejection, I've isolated myself
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   and carried the burden of always living on edge
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   in the fear of more rejection.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   It felt like I'm walking on a tightrope.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   I'm longing to reach to the other side,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   to make friends, to be connected, to have that opportunity.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   But I'm also carrying this heavy burden of the fear of being rejected,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   of the fear that actually what I rejected myself is going to be used against me.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   And I've walked on this tightrope for the longest time.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   But Jesus understood all of that.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   Jesus understood the fear and burden caused by rejection
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   because He has been rejected.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   He understands my defense mechanism because He had lived in this world
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   and He understands my limitation as a human.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Jesus showed me through the story of His messy birth
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   that He is not looking for a grand entrance
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   to get all the glory and all the love from people.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   He is willing to be born in a smelly, disease-ridden place,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   showing me that He is willing to accept me,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   no matter how dark and rotten I feel I am.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   I've learned that the first step to be healed from the wounds of rejection
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   is acceptance.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   I have to accept that I am fully loved by God.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   To accept that with my flaws and all, I am worthy of love.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   And it is a decision I have to make before I feel anything.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   It's not that, "Oh, I feel the love of Jesus so I know that I'm fully accepted."
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   If that is the case, then I will be going around collecting evidence.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   "Oh, today I received this so Jesus loves me,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   but today I don't have that so Jesus doesn't love me."
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   And I will be comparing and I will be collecting evidence.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   I will never be filled because I'm looking at this realm
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   and I try to find that if I'm still worth it or not.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   So in order to be fully accepted, I need to make a decision to go,
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   "Hey, I decided that no matter what happens, no matter what I see,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   I accept that Jesus loves me unconditionally.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   He loves me as a person. He loves who I am, the person that He has made.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   He knows that I am worth it."
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   And so that is the first step for me to know that I am accepted.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   We can sing the songs of boundless love a million times
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   and it would only carry meaning if we could accept that the deep,
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   the depth and the width of His love on each and every one of us.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   There is no flaws and no brokenness and no imperfections
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   that can separate His love for you and for me.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Every time a sneaky, intrusive thought would come in to tell you that
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   there are reasons for you not to be loved,
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   there are reasons for you not to be accepted,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   but you've got to make a decision and let the Holy Spirit to lead you,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   to guide you to say, "But this is not true.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   This is not what the Bible says.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   This is not what God's love looks like."
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   And so with that thought, I began the journey of my restoration.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Because I'm accepted in Christ, fully accepted,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   I have the courage to show my authentic self to people around me.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   I allow them to see my flaws, my mistakes and my imperfections,
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   knowing that since the Most High has accepted me, I can have no fear.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Even though they can still reject me, I am always fully known and fully loved.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   You are fully known.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   All your things that you feel you're good at,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   all the things that you feel you're not good at or not enough,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   you are fully known and fully loved.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   This love is not because of how good you are.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   It is because of how deep His love for you is.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   So as I open myself to my community,
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   and specifically to community in Christ,
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   they show me that this love actually exists in this world.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   They show me that not because they are able to do that in person,
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   but because each and every one of them has received the love of God,
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   the grace of God, and they are extending it to the people around them.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   They don't make use of my mistakes as a reason to reject me,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   but actually they've stayed by me,
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   and even though I was about to run away.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   And I've seen this in this community.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   I've seen people walk the extra mile.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   I've seen people going out of their comfort zone to make friends.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   And I've got to say, to reach out and make friends or to be known
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   is a very risky thing, because you are putting yourself out there, being vulnerable.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   What if people say no when I say hi?
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   What if people just turn their shoulders?
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   What if when I try to say I want to join in their lunch, they would reject me?
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   But remember, because you are always fully known,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   you will always be accepted in Christ's community.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   You are also accepted and welcome if you want to sit at my stage.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   It's okay.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   So with that, I would love to extend my message to you
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   to tell you that God loves you very much.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   And I would like every one of you to stand up and just to receive the prayer.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   And would the band please come up as well.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   Today we talked about Jesus' unconditional love for each and every one of us.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   We've talked about how he understands us in our pain of rejection
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   and wounds that we have created because of the way we have experienced this world.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   We've shared about in the midst of all this messiness, God sees and understands.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   And he loves you.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   And I would like everyone to close their eyes.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   Maybe there are questions that you have in your mind about, you question about his love for you.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   Maybe there are experiences in your past that has caused pain,
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   but you have hid it and you have suppressed it.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   Maybe times that you've been rejected so much that you wouldn't want to come out
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   and the world seems very unsafe for you because you don't know if you'll be rejected or not.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   If you are struggling with that, if your friends are struggling with that,
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   I would like you to open up your hands.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   I would like to pray for you.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   If you long for healing from rejection, I would like to encourage you.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   Allow yourself to be accepted.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   You are safe in God's perfect love.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   There is no judgment, no condemnation.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   You are free to be yourself in God's love.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   It is when we are truly ourselves before him that our wounds can begin to heal.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   So come before him just as you are.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   Open up your hands as a sign of receiving this love.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   And I would like every one of you to be part of that.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   If you are ready to pray for other people,
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   I would like you to put your hands on their shoulder and just to pray for them.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   Pray for them to receive and experience God's boundless love for them,
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   to experience God's healing for them.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   So if you want to pray for other people, you can open your eyes and put your hands on
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   those that have opened up their hands.

[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Thank you, Father.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   Thank you, Father.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   We receive your love.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   We receive your unconditional acceptance and love and healing.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   May what you have planted in our heart today grow and prosper.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   May we walk out this room knowing that wherever we are,
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   however we might feel about ourselves, you always love us.
