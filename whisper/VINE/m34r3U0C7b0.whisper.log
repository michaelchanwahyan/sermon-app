[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Thank you, worship team, and (speaks in foreign language)
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.960]   God's blessings be with you,
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.840]   and may you be filled with the energy
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.600]   of horses and dragons, something like that, right?
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.840]   Anyway, it's happy new year,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.540]   and I'm glad to see it's an honor to be here this morning.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.480]   We're gonna be in Colossians chapter three,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.640]   so if you have a Bible,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.000]   if you wanna turn your attention to the screen,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.400]   Colossians chapter three is where
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.240]   we'll be talking about today.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.240]   I'm gonna read it first,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.960]   and then we're gonna carry on with the message.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.000]   It says this, this is the word of the Lord.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.800]   "Therefore, as God's chosen people,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.940]   "holy and dearly loved,
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.640]   "clothe yourselves with compassion,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.720]   "kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.960]   "Bear with each other and forgive one another
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.640]   "if you have any grievance against someone.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.120]   "Forgive as the Lord forgave you,
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.680]   "and over all these virtues, put on love,
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.400]   "which binds them all together in perfect unity.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.440]   "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.380]   "since as members of one body,
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.560]   "you are called to peace, and be thankful."
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.680]   So it is new year,
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.080]   and if you've been celebrating Chinese New Year,
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.680]   it's probably been quite a busy time in the past few days,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.520]   and the next few days coming up, right?
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.600]   Lots of visiting families, visiting friends,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.480]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.780]   Certain things just have to be done, right?
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.500]   You maybe had to do a good spring cleaning of your house,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.760]   lots of dinners.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.000]   We had our family over last night for dinner,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.080]   and great, we had some hot pots,
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.600]   but it isn't Chinese New Year
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.620]   until your mom starts singing karaoke really badly.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.880]   Actually, my mom's a decent singer,
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.400]   but she was singing William Fong,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.480]   and then I turned up the volume.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.640]   What was she singing?
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.680]   ♪ Da da da dee dee new fong ♪
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.960]   ♪ Da da da da da da ♪
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.320]   You know, all those kind of old Cantonese pop songs
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.840]   that she likes, so we had a good time last night.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.920]   But you know, you probably got your hair cut,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.720]   stuffing Lai Si, passing out Lai Si,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.720]   all these traditional aspects of Chinese New Year
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.640]   that we celebrate in this time.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.400]   And one of the quintessential things we do
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.940]   at Chinese New Year is wear new clothes.
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.240]   Buy new clothes and wear new clothes, right?
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.280]   Especially new red clothing.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.040]   It's a sign of blessing, it's a sign of the festive season.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.440]   We love doing these things, okay?
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.960]   So, what am I wearing today?
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.400]   This is Uniqlo, okay?
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.600]   It's not that new even, okay?
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.200]   But it is Uniqlo, okay?
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.380]   I'm a Uniqlo kind of guy.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.380]   They make good clothing for short, muscular Asian guys, okay?
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.920]   So I like shopping there, okay?
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.240]   But it's also kind of ironic.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.680]   Uniqlo, it's supposed to be unique clothing,
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   but because they make a thousand
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.040]   or a million of the same thing, right?
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.520]   You buy new clothes at Chinese New Year,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.880]   you walk out the street, everybody looks the same, right?
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.800]   We're all wearing Uniqlo.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.760]   There's nothing quite unique about it.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.160]   But they are new clothes, right?
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.320]   We buy new clothes at Chinese New Year
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.680]   as a symbol of the new blessings,
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.480]   the new things that we expect to come, right?
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.020]   This is why we get new clothes.
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.640]   So it got me thinking about clothing,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.840]   and not just Chinese New Year.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.040]   Like, you know, today we're all dressed in our best,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.360]   wearing red and all this kind of stuff.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.740]   But clothing, actually, we have a fascinating relationship
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.880]   with clothing and fashion, right?
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.080]   It's become a very inextricable part of our lives.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.600]   Interestingly, though, clothing was never
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.320]   a part of God's original plan, all right?
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.160]   Genesis tells us that Adam and Eve
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.260]   were naked and unashamed.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260]   The word in Greek, naked, means naked, okay?
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.140]   Naked and unashamed, right?
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.680]   It was only after they sinned that they realized
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.680]   that they were naked, and God clothed them, right?
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.440]   The Lord made garments of sin for Adam and his wife,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.440]   and he clothed them.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.000]   And just like that, God created the first fashion line ever.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.480]   Garments of sin, the fall edition.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.880]   (audience groans)
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.780]   You see what I did there, okay?
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.480]   And this is why, yeah, okay, thank you, Ken, thank you.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.320]   Every morning now, we have to go through
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.680]   the painful decision of picking out what clothes to wear.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.600]   But clothes are significant, right?
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.380]   Certain places we go have certain dress clothes,
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.200]   different seasons has different clothing, right?
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.780]   Clothing is very much a part of our cultural identity,
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.020]   like this I'm wearing today, right?
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.300]   Something a bit more traditional, a bit old school,
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.520]   but it's part of our cultural identity.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.480]   Helps us to represent our ethnic roots, right?
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.280]   Or think about going to a prom or an awards ceremony
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.120]   or a bride on a wedding day,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.880]   the exciting process of finding the perfect dress.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.680]   Right, clothing can also be sentimental.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.000]   A lot of us have the one T-shirt or that hoodie
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.940]   we've been holding on for like 25 years.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.960]   We just can't get rid of it because it means so much to us
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.780]   and it's so soft and comfy.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.760]   Clothing can even help to define history.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.920]   Victorian England, right, small waist, big shoulders,
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.480]   that was what it was all about.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.720]   '60s and '70s, all about peace signs and ponchos,
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.520]   that was the style back then.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.740]   '80s and '90s with the neon colors
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.940]   and the high-waisted jeans,
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.640]   which are sort of making a comeback these days, I see.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.080]   In the 2000s, I went through a phase
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.600]   where I thought I was a gangster rapper, okay?
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.640]   And so I would wear baggy jeans, the big T-shirts
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.160]   and the bandana around the front of my head like this, okay?
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.660]   Yeah, that was exciting, right?
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.000]   That was, okay, let me tell you about this, okay?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.500]   So I thought I was Tupac, okay?
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.840]   But I wasn't quite cool enough to be Tupac,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.560]   so my friends, true story, used to call me half-pack, okay?
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.240]   Because I was trying so hard to be like Tupac.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.320]   But you know, clothing is important.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.160]   That's what I was trying to say.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.040]   Actually, sometimes I think it gets a bit ridiculous.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.320]   We take it too far.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.480]   Right, you see a Wan Chai Market T-shirt,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.800]   $50, you can get a nice white T-shirt,
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.000]   but you put Balenciaga on it, okay?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.080]   And suddenly that T-shirt is worth $500, all right?
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.720]   They are shoes, handbags
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.200]   that cost literally more than a house.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.480]   I say all this just to make the point.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.720]   Clothing is significant.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.560]   It's significant because it marks us out
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.360]   and defines us in some sort of way.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.860]   As you think about new clothes and the Chinese New Year,
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.680]   the big question for us this morning is this.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.840]   How have we clothed ourselves?
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.640]   Like how does our clothing define us as a family?
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.520]   And when I say family, I mean us here today
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.880]   as followers of Jesus, that divine church in this community.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.960]   What is it that marks us out?
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.220]   How do we clothe ourselves?
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.160]   Like when people look at us from the outside,
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.000]   how do these people clothe themselves?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.600]   What defines them?
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.360]   What do you think people are saying?
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.960]   This is an important question to ask
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.440]   as we step into the new year,
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.040]   because we've been talking,
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.160]   we've come out of our January fast,
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.560]   we've just come out of the Exodus series not too long ago,
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.260]   and so we've been talking about a lot of concepts
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.160]   and all these kind of things,
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.000]   but it's time, I think, just from going,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.400]   we need to go from thinking and hearing
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.100]   to actually start doing and being, right?
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.760]   In this season where we've been talking about intimacy,
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.920]   we actually have to start living lives of intimacy
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.120]   rather than just hearing about it.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.280]   Lives are actually deeply connected and intimate
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.640]   with God and the people around us.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.240]   'Cause what I hope is that when people look at us
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.000]   from the outside, they're saying to themselves,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.640]   you know what, this group looks good.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.200]   I like what they're wearing.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.840]   I want to be a part of this community.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.620]   I wanna be like those people too.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.600]   So you could say this passage we're studying today
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.280]   is like the ultimate fashion guide for the church, okay?
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.640]   For followers of Jesus, this is the ultimate fashion guide.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.280]   Because in the passage we just read,
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.760]   Paul uses clothes and fashion as a metaphor
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.480]   to describe the certain virtues and character traits
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.120]   that we should put on as followers of Jesus.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.680]   He says this, first of all.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.580]   Let's pause right there for a minute.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.700]   Paul starts by reminding us about who we are.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.260]   So let's remind ourselves about who we are.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.820]   If you're sitting here today,
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.740]   or if you're listening online or in a podcast later on,
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.060]   and you've given your life to Jesus,
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.420]   you are a part of God's chosen people.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.780]   You are holy, which means you have been set apart.
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.220]   This is what the word holy means.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.340]   You have been wholly set apart by God,
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.420]   and he loves you dearly.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.440]   You are special to him.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.240]   This is who you are.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.600]   This is your identity.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.640]   So it has to mean something to you
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.640]   if that's what you want to embrace.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.300]   You are holy and dearly loved.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.160]   Pastor Andrew mentioned this last week
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.360]   when he reminded us it's out of God's intimate relationship
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.640]   with us that we can truly find our identity
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.240]   in who he's created us to be.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.440]   He loves you, and he wants you to love him.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.160]   You're set apart, which means you are different
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.060]   to who you were before you gave your life to Jesus.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.540]   You are different to those who don't know Jesus yet.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.860]   We're like people that have taken off
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.800]   the shabby clothes that we used to wear.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.380]   Paul defines this as rage, anger, malice,
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.620]   slander, filthy language.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.940]   These are things he says in the verses before this.
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.860]   We've taken off those old clothes
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.060]   so that we can put on new clothes.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.960]   This is our starting point,
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.220]   because it reminds us that we are being called
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.500]   into something not that we do
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.620]   with our own ability or power.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.380]   God starts this process of clothing us.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.220]   We are called into this not by our own ability,
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.900]   not by our own power.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.860]   We have been chosen by God not because we are good,
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.780]   but because God has been good to us, amen?
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.540]   We have been called holy not because we are perfect
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.420]   and sinless, but because God has given us his holiness.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.800]   We are loved not because we're lovable,
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.220]   but because God chooses to love us no matter what.
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.780]   This is the gospel.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.160]   This is the good news,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.860]   and this is our starting point for today.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.620]   We are chosen, holy and dearly loved,
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.360]   changed and renewed, which is why we must do this.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.740]   We must clothe ourselves with compassion,
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.180]   kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.120]   Just one more illustration.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.300]   Maybe you can think about it this way.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.020]   Imagine you've done some exercise,
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.500]   you've gone to the gym, gone for a run
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.740]   or something like that, you're all sweaty and gross,
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.940]   so you get cleaned up, you have a nice shower, okay?
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.900]   You're clean.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.220]   You're not gonna put on those sweaty clothes again, right?
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.320]   You're gonna go to your closet
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.400]   and put on new, fresh, clean clothes.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   And so in the spirit of Chinese New Year,
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.620]   these are the clothes that I feel like God's trying
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.420]   to encourage us, all of us, to put on
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.540]   as we step into the year of the dragon.
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.760]   First thing he says is this.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.180]   We have to put on clothes of compassion.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.640]   Now, if compassion was an item of clothing,
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.600]   it might be a soft, really soft, well-fitting T-shirt,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.360]   something like that, something that covers your body, okay?
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.460]   The word compassion actually translates
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.140]   as like the bowels of compassion, okay?
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.840]   It's something a bit more passionate than just compassion
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.480]   because in ancient thought, right,
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.540]   they thought that it's the bowels
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.340]   that's where emotion and feelings came from, right?
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.120]   And it sort of makes sense, right?
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.440]   Think about it this way.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.240]   When you have a strong emotional reaction to something,
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.000]   right, you feel it right here, right, in your gut,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   in the pit of your stomach.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.460]   That's why we say something, it's like gut-wrenching
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.400]   when we see it, right?
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.260]   You feel it right here.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.820]   So compassion is then when we're able
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.160]   to sympathize with someone.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.360]   We get that feeling.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.080]   We're able to sympathize with them so much
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.840]   that it affects our innermost being,
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.700]   that we have to do something about it.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.700]   You ever had that when you see something,
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.280]   see someone, you just get that feeling,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.180]   you know, it's like, this isn't right.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.960]   I'm feeling something and I have to do something about it.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.540]   It's what the Gospels tell us when it says
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.100]   Jesus was moved with compassion.
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.080]   When he saw people who were lost,
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.880]   when he saw people who were sick,
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.900]   when we saw people who were hungry,
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.820]   it was more than just that he felt the feeling,
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.260]   but it was more than that, right?
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.500]   This compassion led him to reach out,
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.680]   to love them, to heal them, and to feed them.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.040]   So church, have we put on compassion?
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.580]   Like when we look at the world around us,
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.020]   when we see people today who are lost and sick
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.180]   and hungry and helpless, mistreated,
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.740]   are we so affected by it that we feel that
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.700]   and we actually have to do something about it
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.280]   to try and make it right?
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.660]   The first thing we need to do, church,
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.740]   is put on compassion together.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.060]   We put on compassion so we're not just loving
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.020]   in word and tongue, but in deed and truth.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.660]   For this is what true compassion is, love in action.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.180]   Next thing Paul tells us, encourages us to put on is this,
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.240]   kindness.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.940]   Kindness as an item of clothing
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.440]   could be like a pair of gloves, right?
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.060]   Because kindness has to do how you reach out
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.300]   and react to others.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.020]   You could define kindness as having the attitude of Jesus
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.260]   towards people around you.
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.900]   And again, throughout scripture we see that Jesus
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.340]   is always kind to people,
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.900]   always ready to help in times of need,
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.140]   showing grace and mercy when he could have chosen
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.900]   wrath or anger instead.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.940]   It's interesting, right?
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.480]   The Bible tells us that it's the kindness of God
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.220]   that leads people to change.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.020]   It's the kindness of God that leads people to repentance,
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.480]   to recognize their sin and their need for him.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.080]   So in the same way, church,
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.060]   we've been encouraged to put on kindness.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.280]   We've been commanded even to put on kindness.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.380]   Because when we put on kindness, it's like saying
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.980]   we now have the mind of Christ towards others.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.820]   Because Jesus has been kind to us,
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.620]   we are called to be kind to everybody.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.340]   So when that person is on the MTR and is crowded
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.580]   and they bump into you, your reaction is not just
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.000]   you step on the back of the shoe a little bit
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.520]   so they trip as they fall, as they get up.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.600]   I don't do that, by the way, okay?
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.320]   I'm not teaching you guys anything, okay?
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.580]   But instead, you choose kindness.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.320]   And if kindness that truly leads people to repentance,
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.500]   then kindness is actually the number one thing,
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.260]   one of the best things we can do
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.960]   to reach people with the gospel.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.940]   When the world that's hurting and lost in sin comes to us,
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.340]   when people approach us with their messiness and their lies,
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.900]   how do we respond?
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.560]   Right?
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.080]   Do we bash them with the Bible, with rules and regulations?
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.340]   Yeah, I told you so.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.200]   It's because you haven't been doing this, this, this.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   Now look, you're a mess.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.560]   Is that our reaction?
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.260]   Do we shame them for their sin?
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.500]   Or which do you think will be more effective?
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.840]   Maybe it's reaching out in kindness
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.180]   to sit with them, to understand them.
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.740]   I would say that being kind is the most powerful thing,
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.860]   one of the most powerful things we can do.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.900]   When the world reaches out to us, we reach out in kindness.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:39.040]   Next, Paul tells us to put on humility.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.800]   So humility I see as like a sturdy pair of socks, right?
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.700]   Nothing fancy, but without them,
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.560]   your feet get stinky and sweaty, right?
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.880]   You know the Cantonese saying,
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.140]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.740]   If you wear socks without shoes, right,
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.040]   it makes your feet stinky and it's really gross, okay?
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.380]   That's basically what it translates to.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.100]   But I say this in the same way, okay?
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.900]   If we do anything without humility, it's gonna stink.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.980]   If we do anything without humility,
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.040]   no one wants to come near it.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.080]   People don't like hanging out
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.600]   with arrogant and proud people, right?
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.380]   Okay, maybe you can think about it this way.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.100]   If kindness is looking at others in a Christlike way,
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.140]   like I just said,
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.960]   humility is looking at yourself in a Christlike way.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.540]   C.S. Lewis puts it this way,
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.540]   "Humility is not thinking less about yourself,
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.040]   "but thinking about yourself less."
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.660]   So humility means that we're willing
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.340]   to give up our own rights
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.140]   so that others can have their rights.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.980]   But after all, this is what Jesus did for us.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.820]   Leaving his place in heaven,
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.660]   he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death,
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.780]   even death on a cross.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.580]   And humility is essential
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.120]   for your relationship with Jesus, first of all,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.940]   because how are you gonna follow somebody
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.140]   if you think that you know better than them?
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.140]   But humility is also essential
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.620]   for our relationship with each other,
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.540]   because how are you gonna sit and listen to each other
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.580]   when you're already looking down at them?
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.980]   So church, have we put on humility
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.460]   so we can walk out our relationship with Jesus
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.620]   and walk out our relationship with others?
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.380]   When we put on humility, we're saying,
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.440]   "There's no judgment here.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.340]   "You are welcome to be with us."
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.040]   We put on humility.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.220]   And then we have gentleness.
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.900]   You know, in the ancient world where Paul lived,
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.620]   gentleness was sometimes seen as something
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.860]   to be looked down upon,
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.740]   because it was seen as a weakness.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.860]   Nobody ever won wars and battles by being gentle.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.380]   Alexander the Great wasn't known for his gentleness.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.940]   He was known for his brutality.
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.260]   And in those days, and even now to some extent,
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.720]   brutality, force, anger is how you showed strength and power.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.160]   That's what gets things done.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.240]   But if you look at gentleness as like a scarf,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.400]   it might help us to put this in context a little bit.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.840]   Scarves are like a soft, fluffy piece of material,
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.200]   but when it's wrapped around you right,
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.000]   it protects you from the cold.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.040]   Even in the middle of a really cold snowstorm,
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.880]   if you have a scarf around you, it makes a big difference.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.980]   Helps you feel warm and safe and protected.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.840]   So gentleness then you can see,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.920]   it's like strength in disguise.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.120]   It's like a wild horse with all that power
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.060]   that's been tamed so you can control it.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.720]   Think about it this way.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.240]   When you get angry, when you get triggered,
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.760]   what's the easiest thing to do?
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.000]   The easiest thing to do is to react right then, then.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.200]   I'm learning gentle parenting at the moment, right?
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.040]   And it always talks about regulate yourself
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.000]   before you speak to your child, okay?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.360]   The easy thing to do for me though is just shout, right?
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.200]   Just to react.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.320]   Shut up, be quiet, go to your room, things like that.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.280]   Match your volume, their volume with your volume.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.080]   Match their anger with rage.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.700]   When you get hit in the face, the easier thing to do
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.580]   is to hit that person right back.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.040]   So you have to understand when Jesus says
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.880]   if someone hits you, you're supposed to
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.960]   turn the other cheek, right?
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.200]   Think about it.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.280]   That takes a lot more strength, self-control.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.540]   To restrain yourself.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.040]   That's not an easy thing to do.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.320]   That's not a weak thing to do.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.540]   But it is the gentle thing to do.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.620]   And so gentleness is essential within this community
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.980]   for without it, we would constantly be
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.300]   at war with each other.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.920]   Without gentleness, we would be dealing
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.220]   with each other harshly all the time.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.320]   Without gentleness, we would just bully our way,
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.480]   not considering others, but just doing whatever we wanted.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.940]   But the strength of gentleness,
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.460]   it's going to bring people together.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.220]   A community that shows gentleness to each other
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.700]   is one that reflects God's heart towards us.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.020]   A church that's known for being gentle
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.820]   is where people are gonna come and feel safe
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.420]   with their feelings, with their emotions,
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.300]   with their mess that we just talked about.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.100]   Because they know they're gonna be met
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.820]   with gentleness for their burdens.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.060]   But don't hear me wrong, church.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.960]   It's not a weakness.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.140]   It doesn't mean we just let people run over us
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.940]   and do whatever they want.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.860]   That's not the point.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.160]   Gentleness is about showing power and strength
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.100]   that does not condemn and put down and belittle.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.820]   But rather when we reach out in gentleness,
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.300]   we're able to reach people with love,
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.380]   draw people in so then they can receive
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.980]   the help that they need.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.660]   So we put on gentleness.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.260]   Next four says we have to put on patience.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.000]   Patience is like a pair of sunglasses perhaps.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.320]   You could think about it that way.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.940]   Right, when you put on sunglasses,
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.880]   it cuts out the harshness of the light
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.880]   so you can fully open your eyes
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.560]   and clearly see what's in front of you.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.640]   In the same way, right, we need patience
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.340]   in order to see things and people
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.560]   for what and who they truly are.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.000]   Patience is what's gonna help you stop,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.920]   maybe seek advice if that's needed,
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.360]   get into a good headspace
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.640]   before making a decision about something.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.440]   Patience is what's gonna help you stop
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.860]   and listen to yourself before simply just blurting out
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.460]   whatever comes to mind.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.960]   Patience is what's gonna help you wait on the Lord
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.320]   instead of just going ahead with whatever plans
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.620]   that you had for yourself.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.000]   Patience is what's gonna allow you
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.600]   to walk through seasons of endurance,
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.500]   refinement, maybe even suffering sometimes.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.520]   If it's for your own good.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.420]   So that's for you.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.120]   But patience is also a great gift and blessing
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.240]   that you can offer to others as well.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.840]   For if you have patience,
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.460]   it's gonna allow you to be able to sit in the valley
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.660]   with those who are hurt.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.900]   Patience allows you to never stop,
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.140]   cease praying for those around you
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.340]   as scripture calls us to do.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.020]   Patience will allow you to be able to hold a calm
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.780]   and civil conversation with someone
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.440]   even if you fundamentally disagree with them.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.900]   We are called to put on patience
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.040]   because God has been patient to us.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.620]   Scripture says this,
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.900]   the Lord is not slow in keeping his promise
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.980]   as some understand slowness.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.260]   Instead, he has been patient with you.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.300]   We're called to put on patience
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.500]   because the Lord God is compassionate and gracious,
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.100]   slow to anger and abounding in love.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.460]   So church, let's put on patience.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.500]   Finally, we have love.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.900]   Love is what binds everything together.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.820]   Love is like the big overcoat
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.900]   that protects and covers everything.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.580]   Paul talks about love often.
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.020]   He describes love as the greatest of all things.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.620]   He says when all things have faded away,
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.300]   the only thing remaining will be love.
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.860]   Love is the one thing that he guarantees will never fail.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.060]   This is also important because here's the truth.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.900]   As much effort as we do to put on these new clothes,
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.780]   we are not perfect people.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.660]   So we're gonna need to forgive each other sometimes.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.880]   If you take the illustration,
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:30.880]   sometimes we're gonna have a wardrobe malfunction, okay?
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.540]   Our patience runs out.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.980]   We might not be as kind as we hope to be.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.700]   We may respond in a harsh word
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.100]   instead of just taking the time to listen to someone.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.940]   We may fail to truly understand each other.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.340]   We act out of anger rather than kindness.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.340]   When this happens, it's our love for each other
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.620]   that's gonna allow us to forgive.
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.300]   It's our love for each other that's what's gonna ensure
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.740]   that we don't break apart when the hard times come,
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.220]   but rather seek to honor and encourage each other
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.640]   to strive forward to be better.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.820]   So love, therefore, is like the ultimate protector.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.780]   And without love, we would be nothing.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.140]   Finally then, Paul tells us this,
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.780]   that the peace of Christ rule in your hearts.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.860]   The peace of Christ you can see maybe as a crown
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.580]   that sits above the whole outfit.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.660]   Because the important thing is this, church.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.980]   These aren't just virtues we follow because they're good.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.180]   Good rules to be a good human being, right?
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.100]   That's not the point.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.580]   The point is not for us just to become good people, okay?
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.100]   Rather, we aim for these things
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.380]   because we know who we belong to.
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.260]   We put on these things, like I said in the beginning,
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.740]   because the peace of Christ, we are God's people.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.620]   The peace of Christ rules in our hearts.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.180]   We do these things because our hearts
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.540]   have been so captivated by Jesus.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.500]   He is the one we're trying to live like.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.460]   He is the one that rules and directs how we live.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.020]   That's what's gonna make the ultimate difference.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.060]   It's not just about being good people.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.600]   It's about being Jesus to other people.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.740]   That's what's gonna keep us together as one body, right?
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.380]   It's not just about looking good.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.900]   We wear these clothes because we are ruled by Jesus.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.820]   We belong to him, we follow him.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.360]   If you've noticed, all these things are things
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.660]   that Jesus lived out as he was on this earth.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.880]   They're simply imitating who Jesus was.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.880]   He is the one who rules our hearts,
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.460]   so he is the one we live for.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.120]   Because ultimately, it's this.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.320]   Fashion trends will come and go, right?
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.000]   Cargo shorts aren't cool anymore, guys, okay?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.600]   Because if we're trying to look like,
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.920]   if what we're trying to do is just look good, right,
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.820]   that's gonna go out of fashion someday.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.560]   But what we're trying to do, if we look like Jesus,
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.600]   if we're trying to be like Jesus,
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.480]   that's never gonna go old.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   That's never gonna run out of style.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:17.380]   So, that let the peace of Christ rule in our hearts.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:23.720]   And then Paul says this, be thankful.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.920]   Now, on a day like today, I wanted specifically
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.280]   to end with these words because I think it helps us
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.920]   to keep a good perspective on Chinese New Year.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.760]   Like I said, this is when I started,
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.680]   Chinese New Year, we step into this season,
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.520]   and it's very much about blessings.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.800]   Actually, it's more than just blessings.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.600]   It's really about getting rich, right?
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.640]   Gong yei fat choy, you know?
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.320]   I hope you get rich, I hope I get rich,
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.120]   and we hope everybody gets rich, okay?
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.600]   That's the sort of general mindset
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.640]   we step into this season upon.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.160]   And therefore, when we just keep thinking
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.360]   about blessings all the time,
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.000]   when we keep on thinking about blessings
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.560]   and blessings and blessings, if we're not careful,
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.680]   as Pastor Andrew reminded us a few weeks ago,
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.880]   it's easy for this to interfere
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.600]   our relationship with God and others.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   We start to want things of God more than God himself.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.040]   And then when it comes to these things,
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.600]   we feel like we wanna look good sometimes,
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.880]   just so we look like, oh, you know,
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.000]   I've been doing all these things,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.040]   I've been a good Christian, God, bless me more.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.600]   Give me more, I've been following all the rules.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.440]   But like I said, it's not about that.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.680]   And one of the best ways we can guard ourselves
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.160]   in that mindset is to be thankful.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.280]   It's impossible to be resentful and thankful
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.360]   at the same time.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.400]   And as followers of Jesus, we don't need to go
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.860]   to Wang Dai Hsin or Tze Kung Miu to spin the wheels,
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.160]   to ask for those gods, to burn incense
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.600]   for good fame and for good fortune, right?
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.240]   We don't need someone else to tell us
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.800]   what our fortune is gonna look like for the upcoming year,
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.600]   because we follow Jesus, and that's enough.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.860]   Because we are thankful for the things
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.360]   that God has given to us, and we can be content,
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.320]   and that's enough.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.520]   And if you wanna remind of how thankful we need to be,
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.120]   just take a look around you, church.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.520]   These are your brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.760]   your family, your friends in Christ,
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.000]   sat around you, gathered here today.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.840]   This building, this space we have right here,
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.640]   is a sign of God's faithfulness throughout the years
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.680]   that he's blessed us with already.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.320]   We just need to stop and think for a minute,
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.640]   and help us to be thankful.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.560]   Do we see fellow children of God gathered together today,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.400]   dressed in the best of God's clothing,
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.600]   not just literally, but in the ways
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.320]   that we talked about just now?
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.400]   So as a family, church, I wonder if we could spend some time
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.880]   blessing each other in this way this morning.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.400]   One of the things we do at Chinese New Year
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.000]   is to visit friends and family, to bless them,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.200]   to pray with them, to spend time with them.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.080]   So we're actually gonna set aside some time
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.240]   to do that right now.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.880]   Now, there's a lot of people in this room,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.760]   and if you're out in the overflow watching online,
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.560]   you can try and do this too.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.960]   But maybe you came in with friends or family today,
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.880]   maybe there's people around you.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.420]   Stop and take a moment right now.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.580]   Remember those things that we just talked about,
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.720]   that you're clothed in.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.640]   And then as you look around you,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:34.180]   ask God, okay, how can I bless this person today?
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.140]   Maybe there's a word of encouragement,
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.520]   maybe it's a prayer, maybe it's a blessing
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.560]   you can say over them, something God places in your heart,
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.880]   or something that you think would be a blessing
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.440]   to your family in Christ right now.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.080]   Okay, the band's gonna play softly.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.360]   We're gonna set aside about five, 10 minutes to do this.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.680]   Okay, so church, just take a moment, think about it.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.880]   All right, and then start interacting
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.000]   with the people around you.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.320]   Spend some time with your church family this morning
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.600]   in order to bless them, to pray for them, to encourage them.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.800]   Let's bless each other by praying for them.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.880]   Let's bless each other by showing compassion,
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.960]   kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.480]   and see what God has to say to us
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.280]   as a community this morning.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.720]   So come on, church, I encourage you.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.600]   The band's gonna play.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.680]   We're gonna spend a little bit of time doing this,
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.040]   and then I'm gonna come and pray for us
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.520]   in just a little while, okay?
