[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen, amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Thanks, Tim.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   You know, as we come into this, oh, thank you, that's nice.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.280]   As we come into this final week of this first series of the year, I want to bring a word
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.440]   to you that's both kind of very personal, but also one that I hope and pray will be
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.680]   quite prophetic for us.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.280]   It's personal because the topic we're going to be speaking about together here today is
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.080]   one that I've had to wrestle very deeply with.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.360]   It's one that's caused a lot of frustration in my own life, one that's caused me actually
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.720]   quite a bit of pain and hardship, but equally is one where I felt the restoration and the
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.700]   work of the Holy Spirit, perhaps in some of the most profound ways.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.680]   But I also hope that the message is prophetic because the topic that we are going to talk
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.000]   about I truly believe has the power to really liberate us, set us free from many of the
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.920]   things that hold us down and kind of wear us down and kind of come upon us and restrict
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.680]   us from perhaps moving forward in the ways that God wants us to move forward.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.080]   And as I was praying for you and myself as I was putting this together today, I really
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.680]   felt a strong sense that many of us in this room were carrying burdens, were carrying
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.600]   anxieties, were carrying frustrations, if anything like me, just stuff that is deep
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.560]   down inside and as you're stepping into this new year, you're kind of carrying these things
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.560]   with you and those things kind of weigh us down.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.400]   And I really felt like what the Lord wants to do today is to liberate you from the impact
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   of them.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.000]   Now, I want you to hear my words really clearly here.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.360]   I did not say necessarily liberate you from them, but liberate you from the impact of
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.560]   them because the reality is so often the circumstances and situations that we struggle with in life
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.080]   â€“ we pray for those things to change, but they don't always change.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.000]   Quite often we might find ourselves in really tough moments in life.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.720]   We might have those desperate prayers, "God, release me from this really hard situation."
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.200]   And for whatever reason, it seems like God doesn't release us from that situation.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.240]   And so it would be wrong for me to stand here and say God is going to release you from whatever
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.960]   situation or circumstance that you're perhaps struggling with as you enter into this new
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.960]   year.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.520]   But what I can promise you is that God always has a heart not always to change our circumstances,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.600]   but always to change us.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.680]   And although we may remain in our circumstances, God always wants to liberate us from their
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.080]   impact.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.100]   And so that's what I want to kind of share a little bit about with you today.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.680]   And so if you're coming into this service, coming into this year, struggling with some
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.320]   of those burdens, anxieties and things there, I hope that what we look at over the next
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.240]   30 minutes will be liberating for you.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.800]   Now, to frame this, I want to tell you a little bit about what happened for me on my sabbatical
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.880]   last year.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.480]   So here at The Vine, we have a sabbatical policy for all of our staff.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.840]   And when our staff work for a complete seven years of full-time work here, on the completion
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.600]   of their seventh year, they're eligible for sabbatical and everybody gets it.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.480]   And so I got my first sabbatical back in 2019.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.080]   And then our policy is that every five years after your first one, you get it again.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.400]   So I had it last year.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.800]   I had four months off from work.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   And I have to tell you, I was desperately in need of the break.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.520]   If you can imagine what's happened in Hong Kong since 2019, all the way through to 2024,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.600]   protests, social movement, everything that was involved with that, the NSL getting that
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.680]   pass and all the impact that that had in our city.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.560]   Then COVID came and you can imagine what it was like to lead a relatively large church
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.160]   here in Hong Kong through all of those pretty big crises that have taken place over the
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.460]   last five years.
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.520]   So the fact that I was exhausted spiritually, physically, desperately in need of a break,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.020]   wanting to get away, was the reality of just the burden and the things that I had held
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.360]   on behalf of all of the community that I was trying to serve and the weight of that and
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.480]   just needing some space to better deal with some of that stuff.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.660]   And I know that when I'm kind of dealing with burdens and anxieties, the thing that manifests
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.300]   most of my life is insecurity.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.360]   And I was feeling myself more insecure around my leadership, more insecure around being
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.760]   a pastor, more insecure about being a husband to my wife, a father to my daughter Mia, and
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.960]   I was wrestling with all of those insecurities as well.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.200]   That doesn't make me a healthy leader.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.040]   So I knew that I needed to have some sort of break to connect with the Holy Spirit on
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.040]   those things.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.680]   The other thing that was going on is that I realized that in just a few months' time
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.400]   I was going to turn 50 years old.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.240]   Oh my goodness.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:48.200]   I suddenly realized that I was old and that I was going to die soon.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.400]   And I was, you're like, "50's nothing."
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.520]   50 felt like a lot for me, okay?
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.320]   And I was struggling with turning 50.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.240]   I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so old."
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.800]   And like the average age of people across both the Vine Yuen Long and the Vine Wan Chai,
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.040]   do you know what the average age of the people who come to the Vine is?
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.220]   29 years old.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.280]   And so I was wrestling, who's older than 29 here?
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.280]   No, don't do that.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.280]   That's fine.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.080]   But I was wrestling with this anxiety of like, "Oh my gosh, maybe I'm past my use-by date.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.840]   Maybe I'm not relevant for the young people anymore.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.960]   Maybe I'm trying to be cool for the young people, but they don't think I'm cool anymore."
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.160]   And all of this was going on in my mind.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160]   Insecurities, needing a break, feeling 50 and old.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.080]   So I went on the sabbatical, first day of sabbatical, and I took out my journal, which
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.800]   also happens to be my phone.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.760]   I took out my phone, and in my phone on the notes app, I wrote down a bunch of questions
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.920]   that I was going to pray about and bring to God.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.720]   I want to read you some of these things from my journal.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.420]   So the first question was this, "How much longer do you want me to be a pastor?"
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.440]   So I was wrestling with the idea of maybe I shouldn't be doing this for that much longer.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.440]   "I'm 50 years old.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.440]   I'm old.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.520]   Maybe it's time for me to hand over to the next generation."
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.160]   So one of my other questions was this, "How much longer should I lead the Vine for?
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.480]   Maybe there's some young person that should take on the reins of leadership.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.840]   Maybe that's the right thing."
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.800]   I was asking questions like this, "When and how should I hand over the church to the next
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   generation?
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.920]   Those incredible young people that God has blessed me with."
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.000]   Now that raised a really challenging further question, which was this one.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.680]   Notice this, "What the heck will I do for my living if you take the church away from
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.000]   me?"
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.640]   That was an honest question, because I was like, "This is how I make my living.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.040]   I don't do it for the money.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.520]   I just want you to hear me, okay?
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.720]   I don't do it for the money.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.040]   I do it because I love people, and I love the job I have, and I love being a pastor
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   and all that."
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.680]   But I'm like, "If God, you call me out from being a pastor, how can I provide for myself?
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.080]   How the heck, excuse my language, but will I do for a living if I'm no longer doing this?"
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.800]   And then the final question, the most important one that I was wrestling with, "Why am I still
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.440]   so filled with insecurity and self-doubt?"
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.920]   Some of those things that were really working on me.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.120]   And then there was one more, one that I really was wrestling with.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.400]   It was this one, "Do aliens really exist?"
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.480]   I needed the Holy Spirit to speak to me on that topic.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.600]   Okay, that one was not true.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.480]   But the rest of them were in my journal, okay?
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.440]   And I was wrestling with these questions, and I was bringing them into my sabbatical.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.040]   And about a month into my sabbatical, God came, and I'd been praying and praying and
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.160]   praying on these sort of things, and I heard nothing at all.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.440]   And God came, and He's like, "Andrew, those things are not on my heart for you at all.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.000]   You want to know what's on my heart for you, Andrew?"
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And I was like, "Yes, I do."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.680]   He's like, "It's just three things, your relationship with me, your relationship with yourself,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.400]   and your relationship with your wife.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.840]   Those are the only three things that actually I really care about for you in this time.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.180]   And your sabbatical is going to be about strengthening your relationship with me, about believing
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.680]   and knowing and understanding who you are in a greater level than you've ever done before.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.880]   And most importantly, you're going to restore and renew the love and the relationship that
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.160]   you have with your wife.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.480]   Those three things are all that matters."
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.900]   I wonder if you've ever had a situation in your own personal prayer life where you've
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.200]   sat in the tension between all the things that you want to pray about and the things
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.520]   that actually God wants to talk to you about.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.880]   Have you ever been in a situation where it feels like you're praying and you're praying
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.440]   and you've got some important things that are sitting on your heart, but it doesn't
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.640]   seem like God is responding to that.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.560]   It doesn't seem like God is moving or answering anything that perhaps you have.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.440]   And that's kind of a frustrating place to be, isn't it?
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.840]   And sometimes as Christians, I think when it feels like God is not answering the things
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.020]   that we desperately want Him to answer, we can feel like He's upset at us.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.020]   He's angry at us.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.680]   We can feel like He's distant from us.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.120]   And we kind of go through the list of all the problems that might be there between us
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.800]   or between Him, because it doesn't seem like He's responding in the way that we want Him
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   to respond.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.120]   Anyone else ever felt that way?
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.400]   Or is it just me?
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.080]   Okay, we all feel that way, don't we?
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.960]   You see, I think there's a tension at times between the thing that are on our heart to
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.840]   pray about and the things that are actually on God's heart to speak to us about, that
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.280]   He wants us to know about.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:22.600]   There's a tension sometimes, because often I think those two things are different.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.280]   Everything that I want God to reveal to me and answer to me and actually the things that
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.040]   are on His heart, just your relationship with me, your relationship with yourself and your
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.160]   relationship with your wife.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.040]   If you've ever felt this tension, you're actually in really good company, because here's the
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.560]   crazy thing.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.100]   Jesus, the Son of God, also felt that tension.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:50.520]   The Son of the living God in His prayer life also felt that tension.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.760]   The tension between having things on His heart that He wanted, that He desired, that He was
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:02.160]   looking for, and the reality that God at times had different things that God was going to
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160]   do.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.200]   So if Jesus has struggled with this at times, that should be great comfort for all of us
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.960]   as well in the tension that we feel in the reality of our prayer lives.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.240]   And perhaps if we could take a look at how Jesus navigates this tension, it might help
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.560]   us to navigate it too.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.040]   And perhaps the breakthrough of all of those anxieties and concerns and burdens and worries
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.820]   that I mentioned at the start could be liberated as we see what Jesus does in walking this
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.480]   beautiful way of praying and yet submitting.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.840]   And so I want to show you this.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.440]   This is in one of the most famous moments of Jesus' life.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.600]   It's right at the end of His life.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.640]   It's about a week before He goes to the cross.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.320]   And He's just shared in the meal with His disciples in the upper room.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.320]   He's in Jerusalem.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.320]   He's had this crazy meal with them where He's taken the wine and the bread and He's created
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.040]   this idea of communion that the church would continue from that point on.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.800]   He's taken the water and the towel and He's washed His servants' feet and He's blessed
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   them.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.000]   They then gone out to the Garden of Gethsemane, otherwise known as the Mount of Olives, which
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.840]   sits up on the hill in Jerusalem, still there today.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.200]   And He goes there with His disciples and this is what happens.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.720]   Let me read this to you.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.520]   Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives and His disciples followed Him.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.520]   On reaching the place, He said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.120]   He withdrew about a stone's throw.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:33.680]   Beyond them knelt down and prayed, "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.560]   Yet not my will, but your will be done."
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.320]   An angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:45.240]   And being in anguish, He prayed more earnestly and His sweat was like drops of blood falling
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.860]   to the ground.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.360]   When He rose from prayer, He went back to the disciples and He found them asleep, typical
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.640]   disciples, exhausted from sorrow.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.280]   "Why are you sleeping?"
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.280]   He asked them.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.160]   "Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.960]   It's a really significant moment in Jesus' life here.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.400]   Right after this, He's about to get betrayed by one of His very own disciples.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.680]   A kiss brings betrayal as the army comes to arrest Him.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.280]   He then goes to trial.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.280]   On that trial, He's accused of things that He did not do.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.080]   Out of that trial, He's sentenced to death on a Roman cross, the most painful thing that
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.360]   will ever happen.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:28.680]   And He's standing or He's kneeling in this moment and He's praying and He's praying honestly
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.720]   and fervently that God would change His situation.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.400]   Now I want you to really understand the history and the context of this.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.800]   A few years ago, I had the privilege of actually traveling to Jerusalem and I traveled to Jerusalem
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:47.400]   with a film crew and we actually made a film series around the life of Jesus.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.560]   And as part of that series, we went up to the Mount of Olives to where this very place
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.600]   is that Jesus would have knelt down in this moment.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.600]   And I reflected a little bit in that place on what I think is happening here in this
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   prayer.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.640]   So I want to show you just a short extract from that film.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   Let's have a look.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:10.480]   The Mount of Olives is a mountain ridge east of and adjacent to Jerusalem's Old City, named
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.960]   for the olive groves that cover its slopes.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:19.240]   For 3,000 years, it has been used primarily as a cemetery and currently holds around 150,000
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:32.360]   graves, making this soil soaked in the history of the people of this land.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.080]   It is here that Jesus added his own input into that history.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.080]   This is the very mountain ridge that he walked over as he entered into Jerusalem on the praises
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.420]   of his people.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.040]   He would have taught his disciples amongst the trees here.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.400]   Under their shade, he would have rested and prayed.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.240]   But most importantly of all, this is the place where a betrayer's kiss would kickstart the
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:10.120]   events that would ultimately lead to his death on a cross.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.920]   Luke's narrative of the death of Jesus is designed to ask the one central question that
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.640]   his whole gospel has been chipping away at.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.400]   Who do you think Jesus is?
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.440]   Mirroring the creation story itself, it begins in a garden, this garden.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.080]   It's here that the disciples with Jesus have retreated after they finished the Passover
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.760]   meal in the upper room.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.000]   And they've come here to sit around these trees and pray.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.760]   And as Jesus is praying, he's completely overcome with what is ahead of him.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.960]   He understands he's about to be arrested.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.840]   He knows he's going to trial.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.320]   He knows that he's going to take the weight of the sin of the world upon his shoulders.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.400]   And in the anguish of the moment, he offers one of the most powerful and most humble prayers
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.480]   that we have in all of scripture.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.000]   He says before his father, "Father, if you can, take this cup from me.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:19.620]   But not my will, but your will be done."
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.720]   Take this cup, your will be done.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.560]   Fear and faith side by side.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.780]   These two themes will sit over the rest of the narrative of Jesus's death.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.220]   And Luke is doing a beautiful play on imagery here.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:40.100]   Because like Adam and Eve in their garden, Jesus faces huge temptation and anguish in
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.640]   his garden.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:47.760]   But unlike Adam and Eve, Jesus overcomes those temptations through obedient submission to
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.880]   his father.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.160]   And this concept of submission speaks to the very roots of what it is to be a follower
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.400]   of Jesus.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.640]   And submission then becomes the key to what discipleship is all about.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.520]   In fact, it becomes the central idea of the cross and the resurrection.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:14.120]   And to understand that more, I need to take you to another hill in Jerusalem.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.200]   Well I'm not going to take you to another hill in Jerusalem right now.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.880]   But I hope that just gives you some of the imagery of where Jesus is having this moment
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   with his disciples.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.760]   It was exactly in that place that I was just sitting under one of those olive trees in
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.760]   the film.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.480]   And I want you to get a sense of what Jesus does here.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.000]   At the beginning of his prayer, he prays this.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.280]   He says, "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me."
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.240]   Well, of course, what he's talking about there is all the events that are about to happen.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:50.320]   The arrest, the trial, the execution, the painful execution on Roman cross, the reality
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.880]   that he needs to go to the cross to pay the price for our sin and the weight of that on
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.960]   his shoulders.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.600]   And I love what he does here.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.000]   This is one of the most beautiful moments of Jesus' humanity that we have in all of
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Scripture.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.040]   He actually comes to his father and he says, "Father."
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.760]   And there's intimacy in his expression of using that word.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.600]   He's saying, "Father, we know each other so well.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   I'm your son.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.960]   You are literally my father.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:22.240]   If there's any other way, if there's any way that you can take this reality of the burden
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.400]   and the anxiety and the fear that I'm feeling for having to go to the cross and take the
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:32.720]   whole world's sin on my shoulder, if there's any other way, I ask you, I plead you, I'm
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.200]   asking you to change the situation."
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.760]   When he says, "Take this cup from me," in the Old Testament, the cup always represented
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.520]   the wrath of God.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.800]   This idea of God's judgment for the sin of the world.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.360]   So what he's saying is, "Take your wrath from me."
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.040]   Like I don't want to sit under the reality of having to take the whole world's sin on
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   my shoulders.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.800]   If there's any way for us to change that, would you please change it?
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:02.360]   And what I love about this part of the prayer is that Jesus is demonstrating to us that
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.400]   there is always space to express your heart and your emotions to him.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:12.560]   You see, there's always place for us to come to God and say, "This isn't right.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.880]   This is hard.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.960]   This is not working for me.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   This is difficult.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.800]   I want something different.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.400]   I want to change in my circumstance.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   I want everything to..."
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.880]   See, the beautiful thing about the relationship that we have with our Father is that he creates
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.400]   space for us to lament.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.840]   He creates space for us to ask for the impossible.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.480]   He creates space for us that when the world seems to be really hard and our circumstances
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:42.320]   seem to be really tough, he makes space for us to ask him to step in and do the impossible.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:50.040]   I love that Jesus here is asking his Father to do something for him, which seems really
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   simple.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.520]   But think about this for a second, because if Jesus, as the Son of God, understands what
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.440]   has to happen, why is he doing this?
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.960]   Because I think it's this beautiful moment of human expression of the pain and the anguish
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.000]   that he's wrestling with, but he's demonstrating that it's always okay to bring your needs
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.440]   to your Father.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:16.680]   Even if your Father doesn't do those needs, it's still right and healthy for you to bring
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.680]   your needs to him.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.640]   He cries out in anguish.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.200]   He cries out and he asks.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   Notice what he asks for.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.520]   He says, "If you can take this cup from me..."
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520]   Sorry, he doesn't say that.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.520]   Let me say it properly.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.920]   He's saying, "If you're willing, take this cup from me."
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:39.320]   In other words, even in Jesus's great fear and his great anxiety, he still has faith.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.680]   I know that in the times of my life when things are not going well and I've got anxiety and
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.120]   fear, I feel my faith levels often drop down.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.720]   Maybe yours do too.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.600]   But notice, in this great moment of Jesus's anguish, he's so much in anguish that he sweats
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.600]   blood.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.200]   So this is a real thing that he's going through with real emotions he's struggling with.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.800]   Even in there, he says, "You could change my circumstance.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.160]   I believe that you could.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.360]   I believe that you could move in power and change this circumstance."
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.240]   He says, "Take this cup from me because if you're willing, it's possible.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.280]   You could speak to the mountain and if you want the mountain to move, the mountain will
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   move."
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.760]   So even though he's under great pain, he's expressing great faith.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.440]   Do you see that?
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.320]   And there's something about that space that is created in all of us when we're facing
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.640]   hard times and we pray those prayers of God stepping in, there is a place for us to not
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.000]   only express the pain but also express the faith.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.960]   "Lord, I believe that you can do this."
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.280]   A few years ago, I had my own Garden of Gethsemane moments.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.000]   Maybe you've had some of yours over the years as well.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.280]   In mine, at the age of 30, my wife and I had decided that the Lord was calling us into
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.360]   full-time ministry in different ways for me to become a pastor, for her to go into counseling
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.520]   and become a therapist.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.400]   And so we quit our jobs here in Hong Kong.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   I was in the finance world.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.760]   Chris was in the childcare world.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.640]   And we quit our jobs and we moved to New Zealand together, which is where Chris is from.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.340]   We went to seminary, this place called Laidlaw College in Auckland, New Zealand.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.420]   And as we went there, we felt the Lord say very specifically to us, "It's time to start
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.720]   for a family," which is something that we had had on our hearts for many years.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.160]   We got married at the age of 23 and 22.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.200]   We were now 30.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.800]   We had waited a while, but this was the time to start our family.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   And I'm going to cut a very long story short, but we started to try for our family.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.720]   We quickly discovered that we weren't able to get pregnant.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.120]   We did a whole bunch of tests and procedures.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.840]   It was discovered that I'm actually infertile.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.800]   And I have this condition called azuspermia.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   Now, azuspermia literally means that I have no spermia at all, no sperm.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.720]   We're friends here, so I'm just going to get very honest with you.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.840]   So I have azuspermia, which means that I have no sperm at all.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:58.020]   Now, a man is determined to be infertile if he has less than 40 million sperm in an ejaculation.
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.960]   Less than 40 million and you're determined to be infertile medically.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.180]   I have none whatsoever.
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.360]   And so we discovered this.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.880]   Now, here was the tension in my life.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.440]   Number one, I felt like God had said to Chris and I, "Now's the time to start a family."
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.840]   I had always carried in my heart a desire to want to father children.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.360]   Chris and I had spoken for years about, "Oh, I hope they have your hair and oh, your nose."
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.560]   And you know, all that talk that you have about biological children happening.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.640]   And so we had prayed about it.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.660]   I had felt God had spoken to me about it.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.000]   And now I discovered that God had created me in a way that I could never do it myself.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.120]   Are you with me?
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:42.440]   This was a Garden of Gethsemane moment for me because I was upset at God for what he
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.680]   had done.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.880]   I was upset that he had asked me or given me a heart for children and then made me in
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.640]   such a way that I could never do it.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.000]   I was feeling shame because I'd always wanted to give Chris the gift of having a child.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   So I was wrestling with shame.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.680]   And so I came to God in the desperation of that moment.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.160]   And here was my prayer.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.040]   And this will sound funny, but this was absolutely my prayer.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.160]   My prayer was this, "Father, give me one sperm.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.920]   I don't need 200 million sperm like every other man in the world.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.960]   I just need one sperm, one that can do the job.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.160]   That's all I'm asking for.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.480]   I need one sperm."
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.520]   And I actually got all of my friends and mentors to fast and pray.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.600]   I remember reaching out to Nigel and Jill.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.800]   Nigel at the time would visit Auckland for business and we'd connect together.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.840]   I remember reaching out to them and other people in our church community at the time
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.860]   and say, "Would you fast with us?
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.400]   Fast and pray because we're believing for a miracle."
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.800]   See, I had the anguish and the shame.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.560]   I was carrying the anxiety of what was happening.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.400]   But this was my, "Lord, if you're willing, take the cup from me" moment.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.240]   This was me saying, "Lord, if you're willing, one sperm."
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.120]   I'm not trying to be greedy here.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.240]   I'm just asking for one that swims really well and does the job that it's required to
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   do.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   That's all I'm asking.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.160]   But this is what I'm asking for and I'm expressing.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.200]   You've created the space for me to express this desire to you.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.840]   Lord, give me one sperm.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.800]   Some of you in this room, you're perhaps in a Garden of Gethsemane moment in whatever
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.320]   is going on in your life right now and that resonates with you.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.520]   It's weird because sometimes as Christians, when we get into these kind of situations,
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.700]   we actually reduce our prayer life rather than increase it.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.340]   We actually hold back from praying some of those bold prayers, some of those prayers
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.200]   for God to step in and do something miraculous, knowing that you cannot change your situation
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.800]   and you're asking God.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.600]   Sometimes weirdly, we step back from that.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.800]   Maybe we're fearful that God may not reply.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.920]   Maybe we're worried that he's not listening to us.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.040]   Maybe we judge ourselves and we think that we're not worthy to receive a miracle that
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.320]   would be needed.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.480]   And so as Christians, sometimes we can hold back from praying the desperate prayers for
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.400]   God to step in and do what only he can do.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.520]   Are you with me?
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.240]   And what's beautiful about Jesus here is that he's having a real moment of anguish himself,
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.680]   but he does not hold back from going to his father and saying, "I don't know what you
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.480]   want to do here, but if you are able to do this, this is what I'm asking for and I have
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.240]   the faith that you can do it."
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.880]   And I feel like for some of you, as we end this series, that's what God's looking for
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.880]   you.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   He's looking for the faith in you to believe that he can actually come and do the things
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.360]   that you're longing for him to do.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:33.400]   Some of you have been shy and it's time for you to move into a place of greater boldness.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.960]   But I want you to see also then what Jesus does next, because it's really quite beautiful
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.880]   how he marries this together.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.760]   He's just plead out in faith that God would change his circumstance, but then he says
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.880]   straight away, "Yet not my will, but yours be done."
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.480]   It's very famous, isn't it?
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.800]   But I want you to sit in the process that Jesus is demonstrating for us here.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.080]   He goes, "Yet not my will, but yours be done."
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.960]   Which doesn't contradict the first part of this prayer and I want you to see this.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:09.400]   See it was absolutely right for Jesus to say, "Take this cup from me."
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.200]   But notice, if all he ever did was say, "Take the cup, take the cup, take the cup," and
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.720]   not move to the second part of the prayer, here's what might happen for Jesus.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.160]   He might start to not like his father anymore.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.280]   He might start to wrestle with the reality of, "Well, why isn't God replying to me?
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.680]   Why doesn't God do what I ask?
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.520]   Why does God feel so distant?"
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.120]   And Jesus understands that he's sitting in a tension where if all he does is say, "Give
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:38.360]   me, give me, give me," he's basically praying me-centric prayers all the time.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.200]   And Jesus understands that there's nothing wrong with the expression of what we want
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.640]   God to do in our lives, but if that's all we're doing, then essentially we're just me-centric
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.640]   in our prayers.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.680]   You follow that?
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:55.760]   So he marries it with this second part where he says, "Yet not my will, your will be done."
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.600]   That's basically Jesus saying, "I have some me-centered things that I believe you could
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.680]   do, but ultimately I want a God-centric world.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.520]   I want ultimately God to be the one who will make the decision.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.280]   I want ultimately God's will to come.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.360]   Your will be done."
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.800]   Which is a really interesting phrase because this is not the first time that Jesus has
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.200]   said this phrase.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.360]   To understand what Jesus is saying in the second half of the prayer here, you actually
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.520]   have to rewind the story about four months prior to this moment.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.280]   Four months prior to this moment, the disciples come to Jesus and they say, "Rabbi, teach
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.120]   us how to pray because we've noticed that your prayers are different from what we see
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.520]   in the temple.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.840]   We notice that your prayers are free prayers."
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.400]   You see, prayers in the first century in Judaism at that time were all written prayers.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.560]   And he noticed that Jesus didn't pray written prayers.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.760]   He didn't pray the Psalms like the other Jewish people were in the day.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:56.280]   No, this Jesus, this rabbi, had the courage and boldness to pray directly to the Father.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.380]   And so they come to him and say, "Teach us how to pray like that."
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.860]   And Jesus teaches them what we've come to call the Lord's Prayer.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.080]   Everybody knows the Lord's Prayer.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.480]   Whether they're Christian or not, people kind of know the Lord's Prayer.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.960]   But you have to also understand that the Lord's Prayer has a context as well.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.440]   The Lord's Prayer's context is the Exodus of the Old Testament.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.440]   We don't have time to look at this today, but it's a fascinating Bible study to do at
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440]   some point.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.160]   But the whole of the Lord's Prayer is connected to the story of the Exodus of the Old Testament.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.440]   You know when it says, "Give us today our daily bread?"
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.840]   Manna, right?
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.560]   So the whole thing, the language, the way it's written, the whole thing connects back
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.040]   to the most profound moment of God's deliverance and power in the Old Testament for the Jewish
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.320]   people.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.800]   What Jesus is saying in the Lord's Prayer is, "Pray to the God of the Exodus.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:48.840]   Know that your God is a liberating God, that your God has the power to change circumstances
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   and scenarios.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   Know that He's ultimately in control of everything in the universe.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.680]   If you're going to pray at all, you're praying to the God of the Exodus, the one who steps
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.760]   into the slavery of this world and liberates His people from it."
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   And so I want to just show you what He prays in Matthew 6 when He does the Lord's Prayer.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.200]   Matthew 6, verses 9 and 10.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.760]   "Do not belay them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him."
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.040]   Notice that, your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.080]   So then this is how you should pray.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.280]   "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:28.120]   Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:32.640]   When Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane is facing His great moment of anguish, sweating
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:38.800]   blood, He's actually leaning back on the Lord's Prayer, the thing He taught His disciples.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.160]   "Your kingdom come, your will be done."
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.160]   In other words, the heart of prayer for the Christian is not me-centric, it has to be
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.480]   God-centric.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.520]   It has to be this prayer that's asking for God to come and do what only God can do.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.160]   Asking God to come and bring His kingdom on earth.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:02.040]   When we pray for God's kingdom to come, we're basically prophetically saying that my kingdom
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.760]   is not what I want.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.760]   Notice this, church.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   Follow the logic here.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.680]   See, when we take the Lord's Prayer seriously and we say, "Your kingdom come, your will
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.800]   be done," what we're saying is not, "I don't have emotions and feelings."
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   No, we have emotions and feelings that we can express to God.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.240]   But in that prayer, we're saying, "Ultimately, what we want in this world is God's reign,
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.280]   His power, His work, His life."
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:31.760]   The prayer of the Lord's Prayer is a release from the brokenness of our own will, and it's
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.880]   a placing of ourselves into the power of God's will.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:42.680]   It's us saying, "I recognize that in my sin and my brokenness, my will, my desires are
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.120]   not always the ones that God wants.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:51.520]   And while it's good for me to express what's on my heart before Him, ultimately, if I don't
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:59.160]   then submit myself in trust and love to Him, I'm just going to be a bull of frustration
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.760]   rather than a person of faith, working on behalf of the kingdom in the here and now.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:13.080]   I need to move at some point from the "take this cup from me" to the "but your will be
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.080]   done."
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.160]   Are you following?
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.480]   And Jesus, what He's doing in the Garden of Gethsemane is He's processing this.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:24.080]   He's showing us the process that if we don't let go, we're going to end up frustrated and
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.080]   weighed down.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.720]   But if we can move from an expression to a place of trust, then God can actually begin
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.800]   to do what only God can do.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:41.340]   About three months into me praying, "God, give me one sperm," and asking many people
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:47.760]   to fast and pray, God comes to me about three months in and He speaks to me very clearly.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.400]   And it was one of those moments where you know when God steps in and says something
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.000]   and it's not what you thought you were going to hear, it's not what you were hoping to
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.440]   hear, but you know it's Him as soon as He says it.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.920]   I want to read you what I wrote in my journal that time.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.400]   "Andrew, let me teach you something about prayer.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   Your prayer should not be, 'God, give me one sperm.'
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.520]   Your prayer should be, 'God, make me into a man who's content whether I have children
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.120]   or not.'"
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.380]   That was about as far away from what I was feeling or thinking as possible.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.140]   But I want you to hear God's heart here.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.520]   He wasn't saying I wasn't going to have children.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.600]   He was saying, "Andrew, I don't want you so frustrated over here with this me-centric
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.740]   give me, give me, give me."
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.160]   But actually, here's what I want to do.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:35.840]   I want to come and I want to form and shape you into a person who's not dependent on whether
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.000]   your happiness and your joy is based on some circumstance in your life.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.760]   I want you to be so liberated from the realities of tough and hard circumstances in life that
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.920]   you're able to be content whether you are still without children or whether I give you
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.000]   children, whether that happens or not, that's in my hands.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   But here's what I want for you.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.320]   I want to make you into a person who's not dependent on whether your prayers get answered
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.880]   in the ways that you want them to be answered.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.040]   Because I tell you what, you're going to pray much more powerfully.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.400]   You're going to lead much more powerfully.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:13.360]   You're going to speak much more powerfully if you're content with your will be done in
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.220]   your life.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:21.160]   And so this call on me when I was at Bible school was to realize that although I wanted
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.600]   kids and I wanted God to heal me and I wanted the miracle and I didn't stop praying the
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:31.400]   miracle, I kept praying the miracle but I added something on after the miracle prayer.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.120]   I kept praying God give me one sperm but then I said but Lord make me into a person who's
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.760]   content whether you move in a miracle or not.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.500]   Because ultimately I'm here to serve you.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:48.880]   What Jesus is doing in the Garden of Gethsemane is exactly the same thing.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.960]   He's showing us that it's right to have the take the cup from me prayers but we are to
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.760]   marry those with the your will be done prayers.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:03.440]   And when you bring the two of those together in prayer, that's a bold prayer.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.280]   That's a courageous prayer.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.480]   That's a prayer that actually changes things in my mind.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.680]   And like I said at the beginning of the sermon, not necessarily changes our circumstance or
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:18.360]   situation, newsflash, I never fathered my own biological children to this day.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.220]   Now if God gave me the miracle, I would probably have a problem with it.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.280]   Back those days I wanted the miracle.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.560]   Now probably less so as I turn 50.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.280]   But we have an amazing 14 year old girl Mia who we adopted and we've got a family and
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.280]   it's amazing.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   It's not how I thought it was going to happen.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:38.280]   God has provided not in the miracle per se that I was specifically asking for but in
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.320]   the realities of him knowing what was on my heart and what was on his heart.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:48.880]   Your will be done is always going to bring your life into greater flourishing than this
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.440]   is what I demand.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.600]   Are you following this?
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:59.000]   And when we kind of walk in this space, we get this glorious idea that we are to be called
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.800]   from a give me type prayer life to a make me type prayer life.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.760]   And it's fascinating because you can do a study in scripture and you can see a lot of
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:14.160]   people in scripture move in this direction from give me to make me.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.680]   One of the most profound examples is the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.160]   That's a very famous parable for all of us.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.720]   What happens at the beginning of the parable of the prodigal son?
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:28.260]   The son, the young son comes to his father and says, "Give me my inheritance now."
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.200]   It's a me-centric prayer that he had.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.400]   Give me my inheritance now.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.040]   But out of the place of going give me, he then goes through all the things he goes through.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.680]   He goes through all the challenges of his life.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.360]   He goes through all the things that turns his world upside down.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.280]   Off the back of that, he then comes back to his father and notice what his prayer is when
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:49.660]   he meets his father for that first time after going away and squandering all his money.
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.200]   He comes back and he says, "Make me like one of your hired servants."
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.720]   In other words, I would rather serve in your household than be rebellious outside of it.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   He goes from a give me to a make me heart.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:08.560]   And Jesus, as he's sweating blood on the Mount of Olives, he's wrestling with this and he
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.280]   shows us the beauty of going from a give me, make me, "Lord, take this cup, but your will
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.280]   be done."
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:20.680]   "Make me into a man," I think he's praying, "that is going to be able to walk to the cross.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.000]   And although it's going to be hard, and although it's going to be painful, and although I'm
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.780]   going to feel all those emotions, but I'm going to be able to go there in the confidence
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:34.780]   of a person who's been set free because I'm no longer in the temptation of trying to make
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.860]   my future what I think is best.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:44.040]   But I've released myself into the contentment of a future based in you."
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:50.280]   You see, this is why Jesus, it's quite interesting in this passage, twice he says to the disciples,
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.760]   he says, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.200]   What is Jesus saying there when he says to them, "Pray so that you don't fall into temptation."
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:04.440]   Here's what I think he's saying, "The temptation to try to control everything ourselves.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.600]   The temptation to try to stay on that one side and think we know what's best.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:15.300]   The temptation to only ever pray those give me kind of prayers."
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.400]   Jesus says, "Be careful that you don't fall into that temptation."
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:23.260]   And then he goes away and he admits that he is also struggling under that temptation with
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.260]   his God.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:29.300]   "Take this cup from me," but then he moves beyond it, "Your will be done."
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.100]   And then he goes back to his disciples and says again, "Be careful you don't fall under
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.460]   that temptation."
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.540]   And here's what I sense is on God's heart as we finish this series at the beginning
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.540]   of the year.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.980]   He's saying to you, "Don't fall under that temptation."
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:42.980]   It's absolutely right.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.980]   Don't hear me wrong.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.580]   I'm not saying stop those prayers.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.740]   Remember, Jesus prayed the prayers, "Take this cup from me."
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:52.460]   There's nothing wrong with expressing our heart and demanding God and believing for
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.460]   a miracle.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.360]   Those prayers should be prayed for us.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.180]   But if that's all we're doing, we've missed the point.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.400]   We pray the prayers and then we come to him and say, "But ultimately it's your will.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.740]   In my brokenness, this is what I see.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.800]   This is what I want.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.780]   But God, I'm submitting 100% of my heart to you."
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.300]   That breaks control.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.780]   That breaks anxiety.
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.140]   That breaks concern.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.340]   That breaks burden.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:20.840]   Because even though if our circumstances don't change, something has changed in us.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.100]   Something has liberated us.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:32.340]   And it may still be really hard, but suddenly the anxiety, the pain, the frustration has
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:37.560]   gone and what has been in its place now is a liberated love.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.240]   A peace that can only come from the hand of God.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.140]   A place of saying, "Your will be done.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.480]   And if this continues, then I trust."
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:52.400]   What Jesus does here is he basically shows us that we let go of control through an embrace
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.920]   of trust.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.860]   That's what the "Your will be done" prayer is all about.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:02.240]   And so for you at the start of this year, that's the journey I think is here in this
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.860]   moment for you.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:10.320]   As we finish a series on being bold in prayer, this is the call that I think Jesus models
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.840]   for us.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:18.280]   The space to ask and to plead and to believe that God can change the circumstance, but
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:24.320]   the desire that even if he doesn't do that, you will still serve him, love him, look to
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.880]   him, be faithful to him and trust that he has it all in his hands.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.320]   Like the three that went into the fire, I think God's going to deliver us from this
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.320]   fire.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:38.160]   But even if he doesn't, we're not bowing down to the God you want us to bow down to.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.080]   Your will be done.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.320]   So if you're carrying frustrations, if you're carrying anxieties, if you're starting this
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.440]   year with some pretty big prayers and you found yourself getting drained because you're
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:54.040]   doing all the "give me" prayers, but it doesn't seem like God is answering, maybe the invitation
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:40:00.520]   here is to shift, to hold in your heart those prayers, but to add the "make me" bit.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.240]   Make me into a person that can stand up to this trial.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.560]   Make me into the person who's going to serve your will no matter what you do.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.600]   I want that too.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.000]   And I want to pray for that for you in this moment.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.440]   So I wonder whether we could just close our eyes and as we close our eyes, we invite the
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.280]   Holy Spirit just to come.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:25.360]   Lord, we thank you that your presence has been here throughout this service so beautifully,
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.360]   so tenderly.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:32.640]   And Lord, I know that there are many people here in this room that, Lord, that their prayer
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.960]   life has perhaps been in this place of frustration.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:43.280]   Perhaps there's something big that's happening and they're desperately in need of your word,
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.120]   your voice, your help.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:51.080]   Just like Jesus who says, "Take this cup from me," they're crying out and asking you, God,
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   to do the impossible.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.280]   Father, we want to pray for anyone in this room right now where that's their case.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:04.800]   We want to ask, Lord, that you would come alongside of them now.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.000]   That you would come alongside of them now by your grace and your beauty and you would
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.800]   meet them just in the anguish, the sweating of blood of their garden of Gethsemane, whatever
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.500]   that might be.
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:25.280]   And Father, as you meet them there, I want to pray that the whisper of your love and
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:30.800]   your grace and your shalom, your peace, your liberation would come.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.960]   Lord, we pray to the God of the Exodus in this moment, the one who has the power to
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.720]   liberate and to set free.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.840]   And Father, we pray that for each person here that they would come under now in this moment,
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:47.800]   the God of the Exodus.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.880]   And Father, I believe that you want to take some people here in this room from a give
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.200]   me to make me moment.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.340]   I believe that as they walk out of here in a few moments time, they're going to walk
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:03.480]   out of here different to how they came in, liberated from the burden, the anxiety.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.680]   And Lord, you may or may not change the circumstance, but in this moment, I believe you want to
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.440]   change them.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.440]   So if this has been helpful to you in some way here this morning, here's what I'd love
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.600]   for us to do is just very calmly and easily just to open your hands where you're sat.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.960]   You know, here at the Vine, we do this posture a lot when we want to respond to what it is
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.200]   that the Holy Spirit is ministering to us.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.480]   By opening our hands, it's just a simple way of us saying, "Holy Spirit, would you come?
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.400]   Father, this is for me.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:42.360]   Lord, I want to receive in this moment."
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.760]   And this won't be per se for everybody, but there'll be some people here where you're
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.760]   knowing this is a word for me in season right at the start of the year.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.000]   And I need to go from a give me to a make me.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.080]   I want to be liberated.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:59.600]   I want to feel thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.920]   Lord, give me the trust.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.320]   Give me the faith.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:12.000]   And that's you just want to encourage you just to open your hands as our eyes are closed.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.100]   And I want to just invite the Holy Spirit to come and minister to every person whose
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.100]   hands are open.
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:21.440]   Thank you, Lord, that you love them so much.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.760]   And so whilst you're sat there with your hands open, if that's you, in a moment, I want to
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.200]   encourage the people around you whose hands are not open, and they're going to start to
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.200]   pray for you.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.520]   You know, there's power like we did with June earlier with the laying on of hands and the
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.760]   stretching out of hands.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   And I believe that many of you in this room will want to be prayed for a minister to now.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.280]   And so as well as the people standing around you, if there are pastors, leaders here, they
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.360]   can also go and pray for people as well.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.320]   Maybe we can just begin to do that.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.040]   So if you want to receive prayer, perhaps for anything that the Holy Spirit has been
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.560]   speaking to you about, just open your hands.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:00.640]   And then if your hands are not open, then in a moment you can look around you and maybe
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.600]   see if there's somebody around you that's got their hands open and you can begin to
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:10.960]   pray for them and just begin to invite the Holy Spirit to minister to them, to strengthen
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:18.360]   them, to meet them in their place of anguish or challenge and to bring a liberation through
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.800]   God's grace.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   So let's do that now.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.480]   We're going to just take some time to do this in our service.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.760]   So hands open if you'd like prayer.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.720]   Otherwise, please be thinking about who you can be praying for in this moment.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
