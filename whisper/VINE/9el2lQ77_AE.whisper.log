[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   Imagine with me for a moment a church.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.440]   This is not a church in the singular, on its own and distinct, but a church in the plural,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.000]   united across a nation, joined in purpose, focused on building up God's kingdom one
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.540]   life at a time.
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.900]   It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA the grand narrative of the redemptive
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.640]   story of Jesus Christ, and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.960]   brings.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.160]   This church is not constricted by the walls of a building, but actively engaged in the
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.160]   community it is planted in, desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.400]   soil.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.800]   A church that sees salvation as holistic, transforming God's people for God's work
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.600]   and equipping a generation to represent God's heart to the poor, the weak, the oppressed
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.680]   and the persecuted.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.760]   Imagine this church committed to seeing the family as integral to all that it's called
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:19.060]   to be and do, involving intentional, committed and authentic relationships across all levels.
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.040]   It is the sort of place where both the young and the old feel cared for, supported and
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.040]   equipped.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.960]   A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions come to feel at home, a cultural
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.000]   mosaic that honors and embraces a richness in diversity that marks us as the body of
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.200]   Christ.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.540]   It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively, reflecting the
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.880]   boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.240]   A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God and passionate to see this
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.280]   invade all aspects of their lives, where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.320]   faith rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.320]   A church that does not make its Sunday services the exclamation mark of its existence, but
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.120]   instead the comma in its ongoing sentence, a time of service, love and engagement that
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.400]   inspires and emboldens all equally for the conversation that lies ahead.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.720]   A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.920]   This is our city.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.240]   This is our church.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.000]   This is our home.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Good morning everyone and welcome to the Christmas Day service.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It's so good to have you.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.540]   We have lots of reason to be thankful and joyful.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.840]   We have a lot of exciting things planned, but before we do that, I want to invite you
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.600]   to turn to your neighbor and say Merry Christmas.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.080]   Yes, Merry Christmas everyone.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.640]   Well, I want to invite everyone to stand and I'll pray for us and then we'll sing joyful
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.640]   Christmas songs.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.640]   Let me pray.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.960]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for sending Jesus.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.720]   Jesus, we thank you for coming to us because you love us to rescue us, to show us your
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.200]   love, to lay down your life for us so that we can have joy, that we can know you.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.160]   And today we just want to lift up these songs and give you praise and say thank you Jesus
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160]   for coming.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.800]   Thank you that you love us.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.520]   Thank you that you give us new life and that we can know that.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.280]   Thank you that you give us peace that we can experience.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.280]   So we pray all this in your name, Jesus. Amen.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   The herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.280]   Peace on earth and mercy wild.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.280]   God and sinners red with blood.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   The herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   Joy the triumph of the skies with the jubilant hosts proclaim.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.280]   Christ is born in Bethlehem.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   Christ my highest heaven adored.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   Christ the everlasting Lord.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   All on high behold him come.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.280]   Offspring of the Virgin's womb.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.280]   Held in flesh the Godhead see.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   Held in mind a deity.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   Christ the Spirit meant to dwell.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   Jesus our Emmanuel.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:34.280]   Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:46.280]   Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king.

[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:28.780]   Yes, Jesus, you are worthy of it all.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.780]   We praise you and we thank you that you have come because you
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.780]   love us, to rescue us, to give us new life,
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.280]   to put us on a different trajectory,
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.280]   to give peace where there was no peace,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   to give hope where we had lost hope,
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.780]   to give comfort where we felt like nobody could comfort us,
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.280]   and also to remove any shame that we are carrying.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.780]   So we thank you for your love.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:57.280]   We celebrate you today on Christmas that you have come,
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.780]   which is the greatest sign of love.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.780]   So we pray all this in your name, Jesus.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.780]   Amen.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:07.780]   [applause]
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.780]   Good morning.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.780]   You may all have a seat.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.780]   You may all have a seat.
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.280]   So I know that last time when Pastor Tim preached,
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   he gave you guys a pop quiz.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.780]   And I'm just going to follow up that tradition and give you guys
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.280]   a pop quiz as well, okay?
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.780]   I know that last time Pastor Tim gave you guys a pop quiz,
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.780]   and so here it is.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:30.280]   How many sheep were there when the angel showed up to the
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.280]   shepherds?
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.280]   How many were there?
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.280]   Take a guess, take a guess.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.280]   99, I heard someone say.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.280]   Three, three.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.780]   Any other guesses?
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:44.280]   How many?
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.280]   Five, five, five.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.280]   Okay, so in a minute you are going to hear very biblically
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.780]   correct -- no, I'm joking, no.
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:57.280]   You are going to watch a really excellent performance by our
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.280]   fantastic kids at K4C.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.280]   Let's give them a round of applause first.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.280]   [applause]
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.280]   They have worked really hard, so during the show,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.780]   please sing along with them, please clap along with them,
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.780]   give them the encouragement that they deserve.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.780]   And I hope that whatever happens,
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.280]   we're all going to have a great time.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:21.280]   And now, without further ado, let's introduce our amazing kids.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:36.280]   [applause]
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.280]   Greetings all.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.280]   Now please take a seat.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   We'd like to give you a small Christmas treat.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.280]   This play is about Christmas.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.280]   We'll do it in a rhyme.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.280]   Some people have lines while others will rhyme.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.280]   So don't forget cameras.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.280]   Please take a snap and always remember to sing with us and clap.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.280]   Our play will begin with a girl who's called Mary,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.280]   a lovely girl who heard something scary.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.280]   [baby crying]
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.280]   Mary, you are going to have a baby boy,
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.280]   and you will call him Jesus.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   Wow, what an exciting day.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:21.280]   [laughter]
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.280]   Meanwhile, Caesar and Rome made a decree.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   You must all go home.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.280]   For Joseph this month off to Bethlehem town,
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.280]   so they rode on their donkey all the way down.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.280]   Everyone has to go back to their hometown.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.280]   [applause]
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.280]   Where's the star?
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.280]   There's supposed to be a star, right?
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.280]   When they got to Bethlehem, the birth day was looming,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.280]   but they couldn't find any hotel with a room in.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:21:13.280]   [background chatter]
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.280]   Do you have any room?
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:24.280]   My brother has a room.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:36.280]   You can stay in my stable.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   He's here, Joseph said, and Jesus was born in a cold,
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   cattled shed.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:56.280]   [singing]
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:06.280]   [singing]
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:16.280]   [singing]
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:31.280]   [singing]
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:38.280]   [applause]
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   So now we see heavenly angels appear to shepherds
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   who were worried and shaking with fear.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   The angel said, hurry, I bring you good news.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.280]   Quickly, get moving.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:57.280]   No time for a snooze.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   I bring you good news.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   Today in Bethlehem Jesus is born.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:14.280]   You will find him in a manger.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.280]   Glory to God.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   Glory to God and peace on earth.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:43.280]   [applause]
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.280]   Three wise men lived far in the east.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:51.280]   They followed the star to get to the feast.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.280]   Let's visit the newborn king.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   We need to get him gifts.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.280]   Let's follow the star.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:28.280]   It will take us to the baby.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:38.280]   They all gathered around.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.280]   The new baby boy.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   Everyone welcome to share in the joy.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.280]   From angels to donkeys, from shepherds to kings,
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   share in joy.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.280]   Everyone shares the joy that he brings.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.280]   No one snapped out no matter how small.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.280]   Happy Christmas to one and to all.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.280]   [applause]

[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   We all sin against God, so our relationship with God is broken down.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.280]   We say hurtful things to each other,
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.280]   so there's a lot of breakdown in relationships with other people.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.280]   And even our relationship with creation is broken down,
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   because we were called to be stewards of creation,
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:37.280]   but yet we treat God's beautiful creation as just something we can do whatever we want to with.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   And so what I want to do is I want to actually set things in the larger story of the Bible.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   So first, this is a story in four acts.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.280]   It's a mini overview.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:57.280]   The first one is God says he created the world, creation,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.280]   and that it was good what he created.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:05.280]   And he also said that when he created humans, that it was very good.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   It was the pinnacle of God's creation, because they're made in God's image.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:16.280]   But then we're told that sin enters the world.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.280]   It's known as the fall, where people rebel against God,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:25.280]   and they struggle to trust God, that God really means it well with them.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   And so they did what God asked them not to do,
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.280]   and that's what we know as the fall, the sin fall.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:40.280]   Now, as already shared, this sin has impacted everything, every fabric of society.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   And it's not just that we ourselves sin,
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   it's also that there are sinful structures that cause people to be oppressed and suffer and injustices.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:56.280]   And so when we talk about Jesus bringing good news and being the Savior,
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.280]   he has come to rescue us from our brokenness, from our sin.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.280]   And God's Word also says that we ourselves cannot do it.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.280]   We can't do it out of our own strength.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.280]   There's nothing within us.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.280]   We can't try harder to be a better person.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   It's not about putting in that little bit more effort.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.280]   God's Word says you cannot do it.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   You cannot fix your sin issue yourself.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   Now, some of us might wonder, am I even a sinner?
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   What is that?
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.280]   So I want to say a little bit more about that.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.280]   Sin means missing the mark of what God desires of people.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.280]   And that means it can be even things we do in our heart.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.280]   It's not just that we murdered someone or something like that,
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   though that also, of course, is a sin.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.280]   But it can be like having judgmental thoughts, envying other people,
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   acting selfishly when we know what is good.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   And so Jesus has come to rescue us from our sin, to forgive us our sins,
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.280]   and to invite us into his family.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:04.280]   And that's why we celebrate Christmas and we're like, "Wow, this is amazing."
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   The King of Kings humbled himself, became a little child to start his rescue mission
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   so that we can move from being estranged from God to become family of God
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:23.280]   and be in that relationship and experience this peace, this joy, this life
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:28.280]   that Jesus only gives.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.280]   Jesus really puts us on a different trajectory.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   Before we know Jesus, we're enslaved to sin.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.280]   That's what God's Word says.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.280]   But when Jesus comes, he rescues us from sin.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.280]   He breaks us free.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.280]   And then we can learn to live a different way
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   because of Jesus being at work in our lives.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   And we can rely on him.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   He gives us the grace and the strength to become more loving people,
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.280]   become the people he created us in the first place to be.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.280]   And so this is the incredible news of Christmas.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.280]   So there is room in God's family for all people.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.280]   It's for everyone.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.280]   Nobody is too far away.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:14.280]   Nobody is too broken or too messed up that they are outside the scope
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.280]   of Jesus' rescue and love.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.280]   Nobody.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   So that means that Christmas is also good news for every single person
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.280]   because we can receive this gift of salvation, this gift of new life
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.280]   that Jesus gives when we place our trust in him and believe in him
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.280]   and turn away from our way of living apart from him.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.280]   Now, I was watching Instagram.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.280]   Anyone?
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.280]   Scrolling.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:51.280]   Sometimes you get stuck in that endless scrolling to another thing.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.280]   And there was an image that I want to leave us with.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   There was a family that asked this little boy to unpack a gift.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.280]   And so he unpacks it.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.280]   He opens up the package, and he gets out a picture frame.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:10.280]   And on the picture frame was a family picture, but he was not in it.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:16.280]   And then there was a note that said, "Next year, we want you to be part
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.280]   of this family picture."
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.280]   And so the kid was trying to figure out what this meant, and it was like,
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   his name was Connor.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   "Connor, we want to adopt you.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.280]   We want you to be part of our family."
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   Now, on Christmas, what Jesus is saying is, "I want you to be part of my family.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.280]   I want to adopt you.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.280]   I want to welcome you in because he loves us, and there's room for every
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.280]   person in God's family."
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   And so that same gift is extended to us, and it's just up to us, you know,
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.280]   whether or not we receive it.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:01.280]   So this, indeed, is the great news of Christmas, that Jesus has come,
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:07.280]   that he has addressed our sin issue, that he forgives us, gives us new life,
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:13.280]   and that he invites us to be part of his family because he wants you to be
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.280]   part of his family picture as well.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:21.280]   And so as we celebrate Christmas today, as you celebrate with friends and
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:27.280]   family, I want to encourage you to take some time to just express thanks,
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.280]   if you know Jesus, to what Jesus has done, or to talk about Jesus if you
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.280]   don't know Jesus yet and what Jesus means.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   And to, yeah, thank God for the greatest gift of all.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   And so what I'd love to do is pray for you, but I also want to invite the
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   worship team to come back up as well.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.280]   So let me pray for us.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:57.280]   Jesus, we thank you so much that you didn't leave us stuck in our sin,
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.280]   but you chose to come in a way that we can receive you as a child, as a
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:07.280]   little baby, vulnerable, though you are the King of kings.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   And you came to ultimately to lay down your life on the cross for us and to
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:19.280]   rise from the dead so that we can be forgiven and become new creations in you.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   And so we thank you, Jesus.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   We worship you, and we are just humbled and moved and touched by you,
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   that you love us so much.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:34.280]   And we thank you that you make us part of your family, that you give us a new
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:39.280]   family to belong to, and that we can know your love, your acceptance, and
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   also the new life that we have in you with peace and joy and hope that we do
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.280]   not know without you in the same way.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   So we give you all the glory, and I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.280]   Amen.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:39:18.280]   [Piano music]
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   So what better way would it be to wrap this Christmas up, this Christmas
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.280]   service with another carol?
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.280]   And I think as we were singing "O Come All Ye Faithful" earlier, I was just
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:36.280]   really moved when we were singing "O Come Let Us Adore Him," and we'll
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.280]   praise his name forever.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   So let's all stand.
