1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Actually, church, before we really get started,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,120
 Rebecca, please come back.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,400
 Everyone, this is Rebecca.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,960
 You've probably never actually seen her,

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,700
 but she's gonna put that microphone down and stop hiding.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,580
 She's gonna come and join me up front,

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,240
 which she has absolutely no idea what's happening,

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,560
 but it's okay.

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,660
 Come on over, Rebecca.

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,660
 (audience applauds)

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,400
 This is Rebecca, her first,

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,980
 so I hired her a few years ago,

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,420
 and fun story, even though I hired her

14
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,600
 and I interviewed her and read her name,

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,800
 I kept calling her Rachel,

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,760
 and so people in this organization

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,200
 called her Rachel for a long time,

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,840
 but her name is actually Rebecca.

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,040
 I just thought it'd be good to bring Rebecca up here.

20
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,560
 This is actually her last Sunday on staff with us.

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,980
 Many of you don't know what Rebecca does,

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,220
 but you wouldn't be able to hear anything

23
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,980
 if she wasn't here.

24
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,880
 She has been a part of our,

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,800
 she's actually run our production team,

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,960
 her and Benjamin, but her focusing mostly on audio.

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,860
 She was the brains behind helping us

28
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,540
 completely change our system.

29
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,000
 She's been helping us with our recording of,

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,840
 did I just say that out loud?

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,760
 Recording of some songs for the church.

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,040
 She's been doing quite a lot behind the scenes,

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,640
 and you never really get a chance to see her,

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,800
 so before she leaves,

35
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,580
 I just thought we could tell her thank you.

36
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,420
 So if we could just give her a round of applause, everyone.

37
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,420
 (audience applauds)

38
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,720
 Because we do appreciate you,

39
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,120
 and we're super grateful for the years you've spent here,

40
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,620
 and if you will stretch out your hands,

41
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,120
 we're just gonna pray for Rebecca.

42
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,440
 Jesus, we thank you for Rebecca,

43
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,240
 and for her life, for her being in this community.

44
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,640
 We know she's not leaving the Vine.

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,960
 She's staying here with us,

46
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,200
 serving on team, being a part of our community,

47
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,320
 but as she steps off staff and continues to

48
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,480
 use the gifts you've given her in other places,

49
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,720
 Holy Spirit, would you just be her guide?

50
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,880
 Would you be her help?

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,120
 Would you lead her?

52
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,840
 Would you be with her?

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,760
 Would you protect her?

54
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,800
 Would you help her discern?

55
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,360
 Give her guidance where she needs it?

56
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,300
 I pray that she will feel the support from this community.

57
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,900
 We love her, and we thank you that we had

58
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,940
 just such a great season with her,

59
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,920
 running all these things,

60
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,500
 and being a good friend to all of us.

61
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,420
 So bless what she goes into.

62
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,540
 Give her faith and courage,

63
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,500
 and provide all that she needs,

64
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,340
 that she will make lots of money doing what she does.

65
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,660
 In Jesus' name, amen.

66
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,500
 Amen?

67
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,420
 All right, amen.

68
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,260
 Thank you, boss.

69
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,060
 (audience applauds)

70
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,900
 All right.

71
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,100
 Couldn't put that in the rundown, 'cause she would hide.

72
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,020
 Great.

73
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,080
 Well, everyone, I am going to tell you

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,720
 some things about me today that I'm gonna need you

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,320
 not to judge me on.

76
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800
 I've got lots to share with you

77
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,320
 about relationships and friendships.

78
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,560
 So I'm gonna start off by telling you about me back in 2013.

79
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,560
 Back in 2013, I was young, I was fit, I was stronger,

80
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,320
 I looked good, my jawline was more chiseled.

81
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,140
 You talked about this before.

82
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,680
 I looked really nice back then.

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,680
 I was full of faith, but I was also dead broke,

84
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,120
 and I came to Hong Kong in 2013 dead broke,

85
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,280
 with not really any money,

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,040
 but I came to Hong Kong with a confidence,

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,300
 knowing that God had called me to come to Hong Kong.

88
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,280
 I couldn't tell you why.

89
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,080
 I don't know why I really believed this,

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,840
 but I had prayed, and I was sure God wanted me in Hong Kong.

91
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,700
 So I came to Hong Kong, but let me tell you,

92
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,320
 my time in Hong Kong was not without its set of challenges.

93
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,840
 The first major challenge being,

94
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,200
 I'd never been to Hong Kong before.

95
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,480
 So I moved here after never having ever stepped foot here.

96
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,320
 Zoom out a little bit.

97
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,520
 I moved here, I'd never been to Asia before.

98
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,000
 All right, so you know, when you're 23,

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,840
 you're bold and young.

100
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
 I came out here anyways, and I'll have to be honest,

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,960
 again, please don't judge me,

102
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,280
 but my understanding of what I thought Hong Kong

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,980
 would be like, I couldn't tell you where it was on a map,

104
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,480
 but I expected sesame chicken,

105
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,000
 I expected teriyaki chicken, I expected fortune cookies.

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,800
 I had this very Panda Express on every corner mentality,

107
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,020
 and I was severely disappointed,

108
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,880
 but Chasu Bao's are great, so it's all right.

109
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,560
 It's made up for it.

110
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,800
 But yeah, I had this perspective,

111
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,400
 and I will say, the one thing I take pride in

112
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,060
 is I'm not like all the other Americans.

113
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,040
 I did know this one thing, that Hong Kong is not in Japan.

114
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,460
 Okay, I knew that, I knew that.

115
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,440
 When I was home this Christmas,

116
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,520
 all the people that were like, so how's Japan?

117
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
 How's Japanese?

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,300
 I'm like, oh my goodness.

119
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,480
 So I knew that much, which is good.

120
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,600
 I'm proud of it, it's a low bar, but I'm proud of it.

121
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,400
 I know all I really knew about Hong Kong, this is honest,

122
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,680
 was the movie Rush Hour, Lee and Carter.

123
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,040
 That is all I knew.

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,440
 I knew nothing about this place,

125
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,300
 but I knew God wanted me here, so I came.

126
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,760
 I moved over to Hong Kong, and let me just say,

127
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,560
 there were quite a few challenges, guys.

128
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,320
 I moved here with 10,000 Hong Kong dollars in my account.

129
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,760
 Now, this was only a few years ago, what, 2013?

130
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,920
 10, 12, 11 years ago, I can't count.

131
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,660
 $10,000 did not get you very far in 2013.

132
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,160
 I didn't realize this, 'cause being a young

133
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
 university student, I thought 10K was just enough

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,400
 to get me where I needed to go.

135
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,600
 I get here, and 10K's not enough to get you a flat.

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,320
 So let's just say I had some major challenges

137
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,840
 trying to figure out how do you stretch $10,000

138
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,320
 to lead you into the things of God.

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
 I couldn't afford anything.

140
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,320
 I couldn't afford groceries, I couldn't afford living.

141
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,080
 I couldn't, like month to month was a proper challenge,

142
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,240
 and so I found myself in this position

143
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,240
 where on one hand, I knew, I had prayed,

144
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,040
 I had felt that God had called me to move here

145
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,720
 for some very particular reasons.

146
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,580
 I stood on that conviction, I knew I needed to be here.

147
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,200
 On the other hand, that $10,000,

148
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,960
 that wasn't gonna get me very far,

149
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,560
 and I found myself in that position of wrestling

150
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,080
 when you don't really know what do you do

151
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,320
 when God calls you into something,

152
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,080
 but the challenges are overwhelming.

153
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,960
 You find yourself convicted

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
 that you know where you're supposed to go.

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,820
 God has called you to move forward,

156
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,720
 but what do you do when the resources aren't there?

157
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,880
 If you, anything like me, you've been in that place

158
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,680
 where you felt that tension before,

159
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,040
 where your conviction and your resources don't line up,

160
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,800
 where your conviction and the things that you need

161
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,600
 just aren't really harmonious.

162
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
 This was me back in 2013.

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,520
 I knew God wanted me here.

164
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,720
 I was convinced of it.

165
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,740
 No one could tell me any different,

166
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,280
 but I also didn't know how I was supposed to follow God

167
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,080
 into a city I'd never been into before,

168
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,200
 into the unknown, really confused,

169
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,900
 really flustered, overwhelmed.

170
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,240
 I think I look back at that time

171
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,160
 and I recognize I had the right start.

172
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,160
 I made the right choices.

173
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,880
 I wore the right clothes,

174
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,200
 but if we have three of these things

175
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,960
 and we're missing one very critical, important aspect,

176
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,440
 I think we can oftentimes start in the direction

177
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,220
 that God wants us to go,

178
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,960
 but we will find it ridiculously challenging

179
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,620
 to remain there.

180
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,040
 Perhaps God is calling us to consider

181
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,720
 if we have the right people with us.

182
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,280
 See, we've been in the story of David so far

183
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,920
 in 1 Samuel, and we've seen

184
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,120
 that David's calling is incredible.

185
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,800
 He's been anointed to be the next king of Israel.

186
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,040
 He'd be the second king,

187
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,760
 and it wasn't because of his looks.

188
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,840
 He wasn't particularly tall or strong

189
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,480
 or anything on the outside

190
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
 that would give you this understanding

191
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,680
 that he should be king,

192
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,520
 but he'd been anointed

193
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,560
 because of his heart's posture towards God.

194
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,960
 So things are going pretty good for him.

195
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,600
 He goes into Saul's court,

196
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,960
 and not expecting to,

197
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,400
 he's now given the job of playing the harp

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,720
 and the lyre to help calm down King Saul, right?

199
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,960
 And when he would play his harp and his lyre,

200
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,280
 there would be a soothing that would happen to Saul,

201
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,880
 and even though he was possessed

202
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,380
 and haunted by these evil spirits,

203
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,220
 it would soothe him,

204
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,320
 so David finds himself soothing the king,

205
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,320
 and while he's doing his regular responsibilities,

206
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,320
 a season arises where a man by the name of Goliath

207
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,720
 is threatening the people of God,

208
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,480
 and nobody from the army,

209
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,920
 nobody feels that they have the courage to stand up.

210
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,180
 I mean, these are God's people,

211
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,160
 but no one has the strength

212
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,600
 and the ability to say, "I'll take him on."

213
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,440
 And what does David do?

214
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,280
 David steps up.

215
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,440
 He decides he will go and fight Goliath,

216
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
 and he's given this great honor where Saul's like,

217
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,600
 "Here, well, if you're gonna fight Goliath,

218
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,960
 "if you're gonna stand in front of the people,

219
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,360
 "here, wear my stuff,"

220
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,720
 and David rejects that, takes it off,

221
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,800
 and he stays dressed in the expectations of God.

222
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,320
 If you were here last week, that would make sense to you.

223
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,400
 We get the fact that Saul ends up loving David

224
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,480
 for what he's doing at that time.

225
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,680
 David's life isn't too bad.

226
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,480
 You're anointed to be king, and things are going well.

227
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,320
 He fights Goliath, and he wins against all odds, right?

228
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,300
 So, so far, he's starting off pretty well,

229
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,440
 but as he's about to find out, this is not enough.

230
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,960
 He's been authentically himself.

231
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,420
 He's been doing things the right way,

232
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,680
 making the right choices,

233
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,440
 but this wouldn't be enough to sustain him

234
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,960
 in what was to come next, right?

235
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,200
 He would realize that he would need the right people

236
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,900
 being their authentic self around him

237
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,360
 in order to continue going down the path

238
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,800
 that God had for him, and it's as we think about this,

239
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,680
 we reach a new character in the story,

240
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,200
 Jonathan, Saul's son.

241
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,540
 So I'm gonna take us here to 1 Samuel 18,

242
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,760
 verses one through four.

243
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,600
 It's on the screen.

244
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,480
 You can read with me.

245
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,120
 After David finished talking with Saul,

246
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
 Jonathan became one in spirit with David,

247
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,320
 and he loved him as himself.

248
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
 From that day, Saul kept David with him

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,400
 and did not let him return home to his family.

250
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,840
 Jonathan made a covenant with David

251
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,160
 because he loved him as himself.

252
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,080
 Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing

253
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,040
 and gave it to David, along with his tunic

254
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,780
 and even his sword, his bow, and his belt.

255
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,860
 So what's happening here?

256
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,640
 Why are we given this story?

257
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,680
 David has just come off of this mountaintop experience

258
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,560
 of defeating Goliath and destroying the Philistine army,

259
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,040
 cutting off the head of this giant

260
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,560
 and baking Israel in a place where it's victorious

261
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,040
 and no longer in danger again,

262
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,620
 and we get this random story of David

263
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,740
 and this relationship that Jonathan has.

264
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,700
 David has impressed the king, starts off saying,

265
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,080
 Saul is like, who is this kid?

266
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,160
 Like, how does he go from being a shepherd boy

267
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,220
 to now fighting a giant and winning for the whole nation?

268
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,560
 Who is his father?

269
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,400
 What family?

270
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,440
 He is impressed.

271
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,880
 Something about David, everything about David

272
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,960
 has now caught his eye,

273
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,080
 and it's also caught the eye of his son, Jonathan,

274
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,360
 who is like, wow, what is this guy?

275
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,760
 And he ends up committing himself to David.

276
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,600
 He ends up befriending David.

277
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,060
 It says that David is now gonna be stuck with Saul

278
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,900
 for a while.

279
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,040
 He's not allowed to go back home.

280
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,840
 So I reckon David was probably glad

281
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,880
 someone probably around his age

282
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,540
 to be his friend in that space.

283
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,720
 I'm pretty sure that was a bit of a relief for him.

284
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,000
 But here, David has two options.

285
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,480
 In front of him lies two people.

286
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,880
 There's Saul and there's Jonathan.

287
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,600
 And it's not so easy to recognize who is who

288
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
 when it comes to who are the right people

289
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,600
 to have with you as you move into the things of God.

290
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,080
 And so what we're gonna do is we're gonna evaluate

291
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,080
 both Saul and Jonathan and see how some words are similar,

292
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,500
 some actions are similar,

293
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,260
 but actually only one of these guys

294
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,620
 is the right type of people for David

295
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,740
 to be able to move into the things of God.

296
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,180
 Are you guys with me?

297
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,340
 All right, let's look at this.

298
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,220
 Saul, the first thing we know about Saul

299
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,260
 is it tells us that the spirit of God had left Saul.

300
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,720
 Now, you don't have to be a biblical scholar

301
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,060
 to recognize that in your setting,

302
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,060
 if the spirit of God has left somebody,

303
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,300
 pro tip, they're probably not the right person.

304
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,140
 All right?

305
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,960
 If the spirit of God,

306
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,380
 it said that because of his disobedience to God,

307
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,260
 the spirit of God had left him in what?

308
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,940
 An unclean spirit, an evil spirit,

309
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,180
 a demonic spirit had entered him.

310
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,820
 This should be our first indicator

311
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,140
 without us having to be scholars

312
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,780
 to recognize something's off about Saul.

313
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,580
 But I think for David,

314
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,620
 it probably wasn't that easy to recognize.

315
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,220
 So for us, we're reading it back

316
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,700
 and we're getting the narration.

317
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,940
 For David actually tells us that Saul loved David.

318
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,720
 So David's in this position to discern this man loves him.

319
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,620
 I mean, think about what he did last week, right?

320
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,720
 So he offers him his kingly gear, his armor,

321
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,860
 to be the best, to have the best stuff,

322
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,660
 to look the best part in order to fight Goliath.

323
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,660
 From the naked eye, it looks like Saul is for David, right?

324
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,060
 Those seem like good things,

325
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,520
 but think about how in order for Saul

326
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,780
 to even do this, give David his stuff,

327
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,060
 he first has to be abdicating his responsibility as king,

328
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,340
 because it's the king's job to defend his people.

329
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,100
 He is hiding.

330
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,860
 He's not actually living as God has called him to live,

331
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,560
 fulfilling the responsibilities.

332
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,700
 And so even though he's offering this good stuff

333
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,140
 done from the wrong place, it's rejected by God, right?

334
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,740
 And so David is able to put those things down

335
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,980
 and not take it with him.

336
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,260
 Although Saul gives him this great honor,

337
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,740
 his motives are unpure,

338
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,180
 and so God does not find it acceptable.

339
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,860
 Let's look at Jonathan.

340
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,580
 We only get four verses to really get an idea

341
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,420
 of who Jonathan is.

342
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,440
 We don't get much of a backstory before that,

343
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,520
 but what we see about Jonathan

344
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,140
 is we learn about his love for David.

345
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,160
 That's the first thing we get.

346
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,240
 Two times across these three verses,

347
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,460
 we hear that Jonathan loved David.

348
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,900
 See, the right people are committed in love, right?

349
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,740
 So think about this.

350
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,380
 It says it two times, and I think for us,

351
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,880
 as we read scripture in our basic discipleship,

352
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,200
 something we should keep in mind,

353
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,980
 when we are reading the scripture,

354
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,500
 and a phrase or a word reappears multiple times,

355
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,180
 the biblical author is intending for us

356
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,580
 to catch on to something.

357
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,020
 He's emphasizing something.

358
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,980
 And so we have to ask ourselves,

359
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,620
 what is he actually saying?

360
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,580
 Slow down and read the text here.

361
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,940
 He's showing us the posture,

362
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,540
 the true posture of Jonathan's heart towards David.

363
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,180
 Because again, Saul loved David.

364
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,700
 Says it once, and we see that things were not right,

365
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,700
 but we get a repeat here that Jonathan loved David, twice.

366
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,380
 Now, I think it's something we have to ask ourselves.

367
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
 This is pretty interesting.

368
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,580
 When I thought about it,

369
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,220
 if you're the king's son, if you're Jonathan,

370
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,380
 and your dad brings home this other kid,

371
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,420
 or young adult, however old they were,

372
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,860
 brings them home, and him doing his job so well,

373
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,900
 it soothes your dad's soul,

374
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,340
 probably like, "Whoa, what's going on?"

375
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,740
 And then he stands up and he defeats

376
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,160
 the biggest threat to your nation,

377
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,380
 representing God even greater than the king does.

378
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,700
 You're probably like, "Whoa, what's going on?"

379
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,900
 Now he's gonna be stuck in your house, in the king's court.

380
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,660
 I think for many people,

381
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,740
 the legitimate question would be,

382
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,380
 "Is this dude trying to take my place?"

383
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,580
 Right, that's a fair thing.

384
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,380
 That's a logical sequence to take, right?

385
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,720
 If someone is showing up doing all the right things,

386
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,220
 kind of in your space,

387
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,660
 jealousy would be the natural response.

388
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,460
 I'm not sure of too many people that would say,

389
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,360
 "Yeah, let me align myself to this person.

390
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,760
 "Let me love them like I love myself.

391
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,540
 "Let me value them first, let me prioritize."

392
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,020
 That is not the natural response,

393
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,900
 so this is what we find in Jonathan towards David.

394
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,600
 Most of us would have a hard time loving a potential threat.

395
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,100
 I mean, just think about Instagram.

396
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,940
 Most of us, we go on social media

397
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,660
 and we see that people have all these things that we want,

398
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,460
 things that we desire, and it's not really love.

399
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,920
 I mean, we press the heart button,

400
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,680
 but it's not really love that we feel towards them, is it?

401
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,740
 A lot of times, when people are doing well,

402
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,300
 our natural tendency is jealousy.

403
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,500
 But I think we learn something here from Jonathan,

404
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,180
 that we're called to love.

405
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,400
 His love for David was as he loved himself.

406
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,340
 I think if we're not careful in our jealousy,

407
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,260
 in our natural predisposition, we end up envying others.

408
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,280
 We end up jealous of others.

409
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,420
 We end up coveting our neighbor

410
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,700
 instead of loving them like we love ourselves.

411
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,940
 But Jonathan loves David.

412
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,780
 That's what we get.

413
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,820
 The scripture tells us again and again,

414
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,580
 Jonathan loved David as much as himself.

415
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,580
 So when I looked at this, I immediately thought about

416
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,820
 where else does this take place?

417
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,640
 And this is a good practice for all of us.

418
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,180
 When you read something like that that's repeated,

419
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,780
 again, yes, you're meant to focus on those phrases,

420
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,300
 but that phrase, as much as he loved himself,

421
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,140
 where else does this also show up in scripture?

422
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,740
 Right, I went straight to Matthew chapter 22.

423
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,460
 Matthew chapter 22 is a great passage

424
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,180
 because Jesus is standing there

425
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,340
 and one of the top teachers of the law approaches Jesus

426
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,740
 with the desire to test and trap him.

427
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,820
 And he says, "Jesus, good teacher,

428
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,960
 "of all the commandments that are out there,

429
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,380
 "which is the greatest one?

430
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,200
 "Which is the best?

431
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,580
 "Of all the commandments of Moses,

432
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,680
 "which is the best one for us to follow?"

433
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,740
 Jesus looks in the eye and goes,

434
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,220
 "You shall love your God with all your heart,

435
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,180
 "with all your mind, with all your soul,

436
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,780
 "with all your strength."

437
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,320
 And I'm sure dude was like, "Okay, good job.

438
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,620
 "No blasphemy there, check."

439
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,740
 Then Jesus goes, "And,"

440
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,240
 which I'm sure is through everybody else off

441
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,740
 because a question like that, which is the greatest,

442
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,500
 is meant to come with only one answer.

443
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,800
 Jesus says, "Love the Lord your God

444
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,100
 "with all your heart, soul, mind, strength, and,"

445
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,620
 he adds an extra thing and I'm sure they're all like,

446
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,280
 "What is he about to say?

447
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,620
 "What else can there be?

448
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,380
 "Loving God must be the only thing.

449
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,620
 "It must be the top thing."

450
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,060
 Jesus says, "And love your neighbor,"

451
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,960
 what's the phrase?

452
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,960
 "As you love yourself, as much as you love yourself."

453
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,600
 Jesus would say that all of the laws of God

454
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,640
 hinge on these two things.

455
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,240
 If you love God with all your heart, holy,

456
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,280
 and you love your neighbor as yourself,

457
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,760
 love your brother as yourself,

458
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,720
 love those around you as you love yourself.

459
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,480
 First John would tell us that if you don't love others,

460
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,520
 the love of God is not in you.

461
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,480
 It's a bit of a harsh way of putting it.

462
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,840
 But this is Jonathan's love, right?

463
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
 That term, as he loved himself.

464
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,800
 This is the way that Jonathan loved David.

465
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,680
 It's a costly love because it puts him in this position

466
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,080
 where he values David the same, if not more, than himself,

467
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,040
 which is a bit unnatural, right?

468
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,040
 Like who loves other people more than they love themselves?

469
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,520
 No, Jonathan's love for David

470
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,680
 was that greatest commandment kind of love.

471
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,320
 And all of our examples of love in scripture

472
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,600
 is this others-centered love.

473
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,560
 It's caring for those around us.

474
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,040
 It's giving our lives on behalf of others around us.

475
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,840
 And it's great because Jesus says this

476
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,200
 thousands of years later,

477
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,320
 but David and Jonathan are living this out way beforehand.

478
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,800
 So we're meant to kind of see that bit of a hyperlink

479
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,760
 between the two concepts, others-centered love.

480
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,680
 And I think when we see this,

481
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,320
 we should be asking ourselves, of those in our community,

482
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,480
 if we are asking, who's the right people?

483
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,560
 I'm torn between this and this.

484
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,360
 Is there others-centered love visible?

485
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
 Because that's actually meant to be

486
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,520
 what marks us as disciples.

487
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,160
 It's meant to be a key characteristic

488
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,200
 of anyone who chooses to follow God,

489
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,800
 that yes, they would love God wholly,

490
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,000
 but also they would love their neighbor as theirselves.

491
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,440
 See, the right people are committed to this kind of love.

492
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,960
 And the thing is that this kind of love

493
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,280
 is not a result of trying really hard.

494
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,960
 It's not a result of, oh, it's Jethro and me.

495
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,240
 That's great, that's the right kind of love right there.

496
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
 This kind of love is not a result of trying hard.

497
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,800
 It's not a byproduct of just mustering up

498
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,440
 all your strength and energy.

499
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,840
 No, if we actually go back to what we see in Matthew 22,

500
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
 there is an order.

501
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,440
 Jesus says, first, you love God with all that you have.

502
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,520
 And from that flows the ability

503
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,680
 to love your neighbor as yourself.

504
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,960
 He doesn't say love your neighbor as yourself

505
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,320
 and then try and love God.

506
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,000
 He also doesn't say just love God.

507
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
 He gives us this command that we must first love God.

508
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,640
 See, the people in your life cannot truly love you

509
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,960
 as much as they love themselves if they don't love God.

510
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,520
 It's impossible.

511
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,560
 So what we need in our lives when it comes to community

512
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,320
 aren't just people with the same hobbies as us,

513
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,960
 as much as that's good.

514
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,560
 What we need in our lives are not just people

515
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,320
 who work in the same field as us

516
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,000
 or who are same-mindedness or same ideology as us.

517
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,640
 No, we need people who choose to love God wholeheartedly

518
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,400
 because it's only from that place

519
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,240
 of wholehearted love to God

520
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,120
 can you have the ability to love others

521
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,720
 as you love yourself.

522
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,000
 This is the mark of a true disciple of Christ.

523
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
 This is what we're all aiming to be like,

524
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,640
 to love God with all that we have,

525
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,880
 all our heart, with all our soul,

526
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,440
 with all our mind, with all our strength.

527
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,920
 And if we're going to walk into this year

528
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,320
 that God has set for us,

529
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,560
 we need people who are gonna walk with us,

530
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,920
 who carry this characteristic of love for God

531
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,360
 before everything, which naturally flows

532
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,320
 into love for others.

533
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,080
 In the next couple of verses,

534
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,400
 we see more similarity between Jonathan and Saul.

535
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,600
 This time it's not just in their actions

536
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,920
 or in their words of love, it's in what they do.

537
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,280
 So I'm gonna read for us 1 Samuel 18, four, says this,

538
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,000
 "And Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing

539
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,880
 "and gave it to David, along with his tunic

540
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,400
 "and even his sword, his bow, and his belt."

541
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,520
 If you were here last week,

542
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,120
 you've been tracking with us through this series.

543
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,600
 Last week was all about the clothes, right?

544
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,880
 Pastor Andrew wore like the oversized jacket

545
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,960
 that was terrible on him, the one that kind of fit.

546
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,440
 It was all about what you wear.

547
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,680
 And his whole idea is, Pastor Andrew was showing us

548
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,120
 how Saul had offered David his stuff.

549
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,240
 He had done almost the exact same thing.

550
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,960
 He had taken his clothes and put it on David.

551
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,440
 And Jonathan is doing the same thing.

552
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,040
 The biblical author was trying to get us to think,

553
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,840
 to see the connection, right?

554
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,200
 You've got Saul who did this, you've got Jonathan

555
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,600
 who did the exact same thing,

556
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,040
 yet what's implied are two different results.

557
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,040
 For Saul, he's dodging responsibility, right?

558
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,520
 Because Goliath is still ahead of them.

559
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,920
 He gives him his armor before he goes to fight Goliath.

560
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,040
 But think about when the Jonathan story occurs.

561
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,680
 This is after the battle.

562
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,920
 What is the purpose of giving someone all this stuff

563
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,880
 after the battle?

564
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,240
 He doesn't have another giant to go and fight yet.

565
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,760
 He's actually, everything is good.

566
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,800
 Everyone's pleased with him.

567
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,040
 We're all celebrating that.

568
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,360
 The Philistines are no longer threatening our existence.

569
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,480
 Our nation will live.

570
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,320
 We are okay.

571
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,520
 We're not made their slaves.

572
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,360
 Everything is good.

573
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,040
 So why would Jonathan start giving him this stuff?

574
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,080
 What would be the purpose?

575
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,880
 It's very different from what Saul was doing.

576
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,760
 So I'm gonna actually read this to you

577
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,360
 'cause as I looked through this,

578
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,960
 I found very deep perspective that is not my own idea,

579
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,600
 but it's something for us to consider,

580
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,880
 and it really helps us understand what's happening.

581
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,640
 So just play as close attention as you can.

582
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,280
 Scholars would say that the word used here for robe

583
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,000
 often denotes a royal robe.

584
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,880
 Ancient Near East texts would speak of this special robe

585
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,240
 as the robe worn by the crown prince.

586
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,000
 So if Israel had the same planned customs as other nations,

587
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,080
 that would mean Jonathan would have been renouncing

588
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,320
 his claim to the throne by giving David that robe.

589
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,880
 This represents, or this along with the bow

590
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,040
 and daily garments given from Jonathan

591
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,560
 may very well represent his willingness to give up

592
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,800
 and transfer his particular position

593
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,080
 as heir apparent to the throne of Israel.

594
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,680
 He was thus expressing loyalty

595
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,760
 and possibly submission to David.

596
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,840
 So, sit on that for a minute.

597
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,120
 Jonathan, simplify this concept.

598
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,160
 Jonathan is offering David a sacrificial friendship,

599
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,960
 one that's not characterized by competition,

600
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,160
 one that's not characterized by just seeing

601
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,600
 what's on the outside or by insecurity.

602
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,840
 It's characterized by sacrifice,

603
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,560
 one where the other person lays down

604
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,760
 the essence of their life.

605
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,440
 We know that scripture says,

606
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,800
 "Greater love has no one than the one

607
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,920
 "who lays down their life for a friend."

608
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,200
 Yes, that's talking about physical life and death,

609
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,720
 but I would ask how much greater is it

610
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,200
 when your life leads to the throne,

611
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,160
 to the highest position in the land,

612
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,720
 to give up your actual destiny,

613
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
 to give up the thing that's probably

614
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,600
 the most desirable thing in your nation,

615
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,880
 to give up the top spot.

616
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
 I mean, he was gonna be king.

617
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
 The second king of the nation.

618
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,600
 This is where you wanna be.

619
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,080
 This is the position you wanna be able to inherit.

620
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,080
 And he is willingly, sacrificially laying that down

621
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,200
 in order to display sacrificial friendship.

622
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,200
 See, because Jonathan loved David the right way,

623
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,240
 his actions are gonna support David.

624
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,880
 Those who are committed to Christ-like love

625
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,400
 are committed in Christ-like actions.

626
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:47,960
 Had his love been for himself,

627
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,920
 Jonathan could have done lots of other things

628
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,480
 and not laid down his crown.

629
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,520
 Had his love been for himself,

630
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,440
 Jonathan would have tried to self-preserve.

631
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,040
 But from his action, we can clearly see

632
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,120
 that he truly is living in a sacrificial relationship

633
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,480
 where his love looks a lot like the love of Christ

634
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
 that we see.

635
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,240
 I mean, I find it wild

636
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,480
 because this isn't normally how the world works.

637
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,080
 Imagine with me, just for a minute,

638
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,120
 pretend that we lived in a world

639
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,600
 where this is how people treated one another.

640
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,240
 Imagine if your friends were friends with you,

641
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
 not just because you benefited them,

642
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,800
 or only friends with you until you had disagreement.

643
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,920
 Imagine if people came into your life

644
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,120
 to support you fully in godliness.

645
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,520
 Imagine if the community around you

646
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,120
 had no self-interest in mind,

647
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,360
 if they were willing to give up everything,

648
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,800
 not so that David could have like, be cool and be king,

649
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,800
 but so that David could walk into following God,

650
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,480
 into what God had for him.

651
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,400
 Imagine a world or a community,

652
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,040
 and I guess to an extent,

653
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,000
 I'm not chewing us out,

654
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,320
 but I guess to an extent it's sad

655
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,400
 because that's actually meant to be

656
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
 the community that we live in.

657
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,240
 This is meant to mark the church.

658
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,360
 This is meant to be how we live with one another.

659
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,400
 Relationships like this, where it's not about me,

660
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,040
 where it's not about my self-interest,

661
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,920
 but I care enough about the person next to me

662
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,240
 to do whatever I can

663
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,080
 to help them walk into the things of God,

664
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,960
 into godliness.

665
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,640
 Not harboring jealousy

666
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,120
 because maybe they got the promotion and I didn't.

667
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,520
 Not being mad because they can afford a good holiday

668
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,720
 and I can't,

669
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,240
 or they have the perfect relationship,

670
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,600
 or the perfect house, or the perfect car,

671
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,640
 or the, they have, whatever it is.

672
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,480
 Not just living by sight,

673
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,400
 but truly discerning,

674
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,000
 living by the Spirit,

675
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,360
 and actually cooperating,

676
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,160
 working alongside the things

677
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,480
 that God is doing in the life.

678
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,880
 In the lives of others.

679
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,280
 That is actually the purpose for community.

680
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,720
 That is why we exist.

681
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,120
 Man, these kinds of people will definitely

682
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,800
 make you feel good about yourself.

683
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,120
 But beyond that, they will help you

684
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,960
 walk into the things of God.

685
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,560
 They encourage and they will support.

686
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,600
 They are present, they are active,

687
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,640
 and they are intentionally engaged

688
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,360
 in helping you reach the things of God.

689
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,560
 And what Jonathan does here is not just symbolic.

690
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,160
 Yes, he takes off these garments

691
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,920
 and passes it to David,

692
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,880
 but it's actually followed up with some action.

693
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,120
 If you look at the next three chapters

694
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,840
 from 19, 20, and 21 of 1 Samuel,

695
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,320
 you will see in the narrative

696
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,240
 that David goes from everything's not that bad,

697
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,560
 to running for his life,

698
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,120
 to fleeing, to hiding.

699
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,040
 There's a certain point where he's in a cave

700
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,680
 while still waiting for the promises of God.

701
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
 He is running, he is desperate.

702
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,960
 He is almost an outlaw in the kingdom

703
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,200
 that he's been promised.

704
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
 And you recognize that it's at that point

705
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,880
 that God had done something incredible.

706
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,920
 The very thing David needed to be able to sustain

707
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,800
 in the promises of God

708
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,600
 was not just found in his good heart.

709
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,520
 It would be found in this relationship.

710
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,920
 See, what Jonathan would do is remarkable.

711
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,480
 He would lie to his father,

712
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,960
 to the king who had the right to kill him,

713
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,080
 but also to his father, his father, right?

714
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,440
 He would lie to him, he would deceive him,

715
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,120
 he would go against the king of the nation

716
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,160
 in order to help David.

717
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,120
 There's one point I thought was very interesting.

718
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,480
 It said that when this evil spirit would possess Saul,

719
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,760
 there was one point where Jonathan made him so mad

720
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,360
 in trying to save and protect David

721
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
 that Saul lunged a sphere at him

722
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,200
 to try and kill him, it said with the intent to kill him.

723
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,840
 So it wasn't just a symbolic,

724
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,200
 okay, yes, you can become king and I'm gonna support you.

725
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,360
 Dude backed it up with the way he lived.

726
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,040
 He put himself, he put his life on the line

727
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,720
 to help this man walk into the things of God.

728
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,560
 Y'all, that is unreal friendship.

729
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,600
 That is sacrificial friendship,

730
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,200
 sabotaging your dad's plans.

731
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,240
 Now, I obviously, I come from the US

732
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
 and the culture I come from

733
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,000
 has a very individualistic society.

734
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,960
 And so whenever I read through this,

735
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,000
 you know, growing up or over the years,

736
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,200
 it never really stuck out to me,

737
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,160
 but I had a greater appreciation reading this

738
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,640
 after being in Hong Kong for the past 11 years

739
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,280
 because in this culture, we value family a lot.

740
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,880
 We operate as a unit, right?

741
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,120
 And the idea of going against your family

742
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,240
 is not something you just gloss over

743
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,920
 and get to the fun part of the scripture.

744
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,280
 That makes you halt and you steps, right?

745
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,640
 The idea of sabotaging your family

746
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,360
 in order to help the things of God in another place,

747
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,400
 that's wild, especially here.

748
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,080
 Push it even further, the idea of going against your father,

749
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,520
 that definitely brings some sort of tension.

750
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,160
 So much so, because again, I've not grown up in Hong Kong.

751
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,400
 So I talked to someone who did,

752
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,520
 the girl who did these slides, her name is Veronica,

753
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,840
 and I was asking her about what does it make you feel

754
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,360
 when you zoom in on the idea

755
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,080
 that Jonathan had to resist, shrug off,

756
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,080
 lie to, lose, push back, disagree with his father?

757
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,320
 How does that make you feel in your context,

758
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,480
 even your story, even your life?

759
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,960
 And she was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's tension,

760
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,200
 it's all those things, it feels awkward.

761
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,720
 And it's like, oh, I could never do that.

762
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,680
 But what was even greater was the next day,

763
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,280
 came back to work and she was like,

764
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,000
 dude, thinking about that, I had dreams about it last night.

765
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,920
 It caused me that much distress

766
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,520
 just thinking about what that would mean,

767
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,720
 that it seeped into my dreams last night.

768
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,640
 Like this is the level of sacrificial friendship.

769
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,000
 Like I give you that example to show you

770
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,360
 just how sacrificial of a friendship

771
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,400
 Jonathan had with David.

772
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,520
 And even greater, David is this man of God,

773
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,720
 David is doing all the things right.

774
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,640
 And I feel like maybe it's something

775
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,520
 we need to specifically keep in mind.

776
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,480
 He's able to slay giants,

777
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,560
 he's able to be anointed as king,

778
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,080
 he's able to soothe Saul's soul.

779
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,880
 But in order for him to properly

780
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,640
 step into what God has for him,

781
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,760
 the destiny and the promises of God,

782
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,320
 even with God's help, he needs a friend.

783
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,880
 Think about that.

784
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,400
 Even with God by himself, David needed a godly community.

785
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,520
 He needed a true spiritual friendship.

786
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,080
 He needed sacrificial people who were in his life

787
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,760
 willing to help him follow and go where God was leading.

788
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,600
 I think for you and I,

789
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,680
 we're not that much different from David.

790
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,280
 We also have obstacles in where God is calling us to be.

791
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,840
 The things that God has for you this year,

792
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,280
 where he's hoping to develop and grow you,

793
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,920
 there will be things that prevent us from that.

794
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,520
 And having the right people are critical.

795
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,560
 And every time I preach on community here,

796
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,320
 I recognize that it's a bit of like a preaching

797
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,040
 to the choir, because I think in theory,

798
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,440
 we all recognize community is good, right?

799
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,000
 No one's like, "Boo, community, we hate it."

800
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,960
 No, especially not with Pastor Jennifer,

801
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,000
 our community group pastor here.

802
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,440
 We definitely don't say that.

803
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,640
 But there is this basic temptation

804
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,600
 that we do have to resist.

805
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,520
 There is this passive pattern that we step into

806
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,760
 where yes, we know this is important,

807
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,360
 yet we unfortunately believe

808
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,360
 and live out the lie that we can do it on our own,

809
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,480
 or that we actually don't need others.

810
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,760
 It's a passive belief.

811
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,440
 I don't think most of us are trying to cut people out.

812
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,480
 It's not an active belief,

813
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,320
 but the consequences are still as dangerous.

814
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,160
 We are tempted to not recognize that we genuinely need.

815
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,120
 It's not really an option.

816
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,440
 We genuinely need the right people.

817
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,280
 We're tempted to think that

818
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,160
 if we just make the right choices,

819
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,880
 if we just start the right way,

820
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,280
 if we just wear the right clothes, we'll be okay.

821
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,080
 But our biggest help is ignored

822
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,640
 when we don't realize that we desperately

823
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,800
 also need the right people.

824
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
 But here's the thing, God knows.

825
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,720
 He knows that you need support to keep your faith strong.

826
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,120
 He knows that when things get hard,

827
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,200
 you need help to be emboldened

828
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,800
 to withstand whatever obstacles are in front of you.

829
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,720
 He knows that you need strengthening

830
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,440
 in the days and the weeks ahead

831
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,480
 to resist the insecurities

832
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,960
 and to resist spiraling into fear.

833
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,360
 My question is this,

834
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,480
 what if God is saying that the very thing you need

835
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,360
 is only gonna be found as a byproduct

836
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,000
 of investing in relationships with the right people?

837
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,960
 What if that's the only option?

838
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,160
 What if that's his only way?

839
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,200
 It's not like a plan A, plan B.

840
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,600
 What if that's the only plan?

841
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,800
 What if this is God's way of actually providing

842
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,360
 the help that we need?

843
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,880
 I mean, that's certainly what he did with David.

844
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,480
 We can find ourselves thinking

845
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,160
 that we need to pray the right prayer,

846
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,920
 attend the right amount of services,

847
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,240
 join the right teams, read the right passages in Scripture,

848
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,200
 go to the right self-help person,

849
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,440
 do all the right things, wear the right clothes,

850
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,000
 have the right belief system, attend the right classes,

851
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 and God is saying, "Stop praying the right prayer.

852
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,600
 "I've given you the right people."

853
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,560
 Like, this is our biggest help,

854
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,200
 and he's provided so many of us.

855
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,480
 I mean, just look to your left and your right.

856
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,240
 When I speak of the right people,

857
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,200
 you guys are it, right?

858
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,400
 Also, you guys as well, not just this time.

859
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,760
 Perhaps that's the reality.

860
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,960
 God has designed it this way.

861
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,920
 He's designed it intentionally to be this way.

862
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,200
 And perhaps the things of God

863
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,680
 are not actually meant to be attained in isolation

864
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,440
 because the things of God are not just for us.

865
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,320
 Maybe that's why he won't let you do it by yourself.

866
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,760
 Maybe that's why he wouldn't just let David

867
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,960
 get to where he needed to go by himself.

868
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,080
 See, David's kingship was not just for David.

869
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,520
 You could even argue it was never for David

870
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,200
 in the first place.

871
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,040
 It was God's way of leading his people,

872
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,160
 God's way of being present with his people.

873
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,400
 The king served a role, all right?

874
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,240
 So the thing that you're being led towards

875
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,680
 isn't just for you.

876
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,480
 When we try and do it on our own,

877
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,080
 we end up super susceptible to that faulty thinking.

878
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,960
 We tend to think that the end-all, be-all

879
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,200
 is receiving whatever God has for me

880
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,520
 in this year of action.

881
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,240
 We end up worshiping a me-centric God.

882
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,840
 But what if the purpose God has for you

883
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,200
 is only accomplished with the right people

884
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,000
 because the purposes are for the benefit of all people?

885
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,080
 God's purpose, the whole Bible is this beautiful picture

886
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,520
 of God redeeming and reconciling all creation

887
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,920
 back to himself.

888
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,560
 That is the whole book right there.

889
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,640
 That is what we're aiming for.

890
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,280
 That is what he's doing.

891
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,760
 So we need the right people

892
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,120
 to help us follow Christ correctly,

893
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,320
 knowing that whatever God has in store for you

894
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,240
 and for you this year, whatever new thing you start,

895
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,640
 whatever year of action, however it manifests itself,

896
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,680
 it's not just for you.

897
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,280
 Having the right people helps us recognize

898
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,680
 that it's actually all connected to God's heart

899
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,280
 and his plan to redeem and reconcile

900
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,320
 all things back to himself.

901
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,120
 Guys, apart from these kinds of relationships there,

902
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,600
 I don't know another way that you can actually stay

903
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,440
 where God's sending you.

904
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,360
 So if you wanna start, well, do the first three things.

905
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,960
 Make good choices, wear the right clothes,

906
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,720
 have the right start.

907
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,880
 I think most of us aren't interested

908
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,600
 in just starting the things of God.

909
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,480
 Most of us are interested in abiding and remaining

910
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,360
 and being steadfast in the things of God,

911
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,520
 continuing the good faith journey.

912
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,320
 And I really don't want us to miss out on the true gift,

913
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,280
 the true gift that friendship is.

914
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,240
 Like David and Jonathan's story,

915
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,280
 I was, this morning we were praying

916
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,160
 before the 9/15 service.

917
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,120
 One of our staff, Gordon, was praying.

918
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,480
 He was like, "Jesus, thank you," all this stuff,

919
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,480
 for Pastor Promise and for just this unique story

920
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,080
 of friendship, and it hit me

921
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,600
 because it's actually not meant to be unique.

922
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,440
 It's actually meant to be pretty common.

923
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,960
 It's meant to be the way that we naturally operate,

924
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,520
 the way that we naturally live being there for one another.

925
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,880
 So I started off this whole sermon, this whole talk,

926
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,840
 telling you about all my faulty things

927
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,120
 and coming to Hong Kong with only 10K in my pocket

928
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,080
 and looking for Panda Express on every corner

929
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,120
 and being very sad.

930
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,360
 I wanna tell you how it ended.

931
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,000
 So I get here, and again, I don't have praying hard enough

932
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,440
 didn't make rents become super, super, super affordable

933
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,440
 or free, but what ended up happening was ridiculous.

934
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,680
 This is true.

935
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,620
 We prayed for a free flat.

936
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,240
 So me, my best friend Rick, my other best friend, Irem.

937
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,840
 Rick used to serve here on the worship team.

938
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,240
 Irem used to be one of our designers at the Vine

939
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,320
 before they both moved to the States a few years back.

940
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,960
 And we prayed, we're like, "God, give us a free flat."

941
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,240
 Now, those kind of prayers are a lot easier

942
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,480
 when you're 23 years old.

943
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,760
 I realized I must not have that kind of faith anymore,

944
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
 but we prayed for that.

945
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,040
 And here's what happened.

946
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,140
 God did not give us a free flat.

947
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,240
 There you go.

948
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,320
 No, what he did was a lady in the church

949
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,460
 offered to give us her flat for one US dollar a year.

950
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,040
 Y'all, I know, that was me.

951
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,760
 I was like, "Wait, this stuff happens?"

952
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,640
 I genuinely couldn't believe it.

953
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
 But here's the thing.

954
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,060
 Here's the kicker.

955
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:30,280
 She gave the flat to Rick and Irem, not to me,

956
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,000
 'cause I didn't work at that church.

957
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,960
 So here I am, my needs haven't been met yet,

958
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,580
 but I know God wants me in Hong Kong,

959
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,780
 but how am I gonna live?

960
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,080
 Like, how am I supposed to, like, where do I go?

961
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,080
 And if I had not had these relationships

962
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,720
 with Rick and Irem, people who weren't just interested

963
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,360
 in me hanging out in Hong Kong,

964
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,280
 but who prayed and discerned with me,

965
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,040
 who were like iron sharpening me to do the things of God,

966
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,220
 I would have not had the blessings

967
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,380
 that came through being friends with them.

968
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,080
 So I was able to live with them, slept on the couch.

969
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,220
 But it worked, it was good, we were okay.

970
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,220
 These guys monthly would be a part of my support system.

971
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,580
 They were interns, so remember, not much money, right?

972
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,020
 And church interns, so like very little money.

973
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,660
 Just put it out there, put it out there.

974
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,000
 But they were giving every single month

975
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,960
 to help make sure that I could live each minute.

976
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,900
 There were countless, y'all, there were,

977
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,980
 like I think about it, and there's countless of examples

978
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,220
 of different people, the right people,

979
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,220
 people who were spiritually helping me,

980
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,100
 but were also financially helping me,

981
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,980
 who had no obligation to me,

982
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,600
 who had no reason to support me.

983
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,420
 I think I've shared with you about how I got money

984
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,660
 to be able to propose to my wife

985
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,460
 because some dude just gave, like, God just provided,

986
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,820
 but he didn't just provide the thing,

987
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,020
 he provided the people, right?

988
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,660
 I remember when we first got here,

989
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,100
 one of the, yes, those are the big blessings that happened,

990
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,240
 but some of the practical things, like, you know,

991
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,500
 where's Jollibee?

992
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,540
 That was big.

993
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,340
 My mate showed me where Jollibee was.

994
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,540
 I learned that maybe I can't get sesame chicken,

995
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,300
 but char siu bao is the next best thing, right?

996
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,540
 Quality stuff.

997
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,720
 I didn't know how to get off of the bus,

998
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,820
 off of a minibus, and I was, y'all,

999
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,180
 I was terrified waiting for the bus driver, right?

1000
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,260
 Like, I'd sit there, my hands would get sweaty,

1001
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,820
 I'd be practicing over and over,

1002
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,380
 "Oh, I'm about to see someone going, I'm about to see someone,"

1003
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,100
 and just be like, "Am I gonna say it this time?"

1004
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,180
 And he'd go past my stop, I'm like,

1005
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,780
 "I'll just wait until someone else says it,

1006
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,900
 "and I'll walk back an extra two kilometers."

1007
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,240
 But my friends were the ones that taught me,

1008
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,760
 and showed me, and helped me actually

1009
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,860
 be sustained in this city.

1010
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,880
 Those are silly examples, but they're practical.

1011
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,120
 They're everyday things, and the people that God has

1012
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,160
 in your life, they're not just here for the big miracles.

1013
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,640
 It's also here for the everyday, small things,

1014
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,820
 the simple things.

1015
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,300
 And I share that because I want that for us.

1016
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,480
 I don't want us starting in the way of God

1017
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
 not being able to finish.

1018
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,120
 I don't want us being alone when there's so many people

1019
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,020
 who love Jesus right here.

1020
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,460
 When the church is meant to be the help of God

1021
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,820
 in the world, when we are meant to be his activity,

1022
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,040
 his hands and his feet, his provision may very much be

1023
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,300
 the people in your life, the right people in your life.

1024
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,840
 And so we've talked about what the right

1025
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,080
 and the wrong look like.

1026
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,500
 So this isn't a sermon where we get reflective,

1027
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,580
 I'm actually gonna get you all to just go ahead and stand.

1028
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,780
 As the worship team comes up on stage,

1029
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,380
 everyone go ahead and stand up.

1030
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,880
 All right, everybody stand up, stand up, stand up.

1031
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:38,500
 And the way I wanna end this whole series,

1032
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,780
 we've learned lots of things.

1033
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:45,260
 We've understood lots of ways, things that God has for us,

1034
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,940
 how we begin well.

1035
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,060
 And I wanna pray for us that we would be able

1036
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,140
 to find the right people.

1037
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,860
 I wanna pray commissioning us to actually following through

1038
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,740
 and investing in the right relationships.

1039
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,280
 I wanna pray for the boldness to be able to do that,

1040
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,700
 for the vulnerability that that requires,

1041
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,540
 because that's not always easy.

1042
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,560
 A lot of us carry hurt from wrong people,

1043
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,500
 wrong relationships that make it so hard

1044
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,140
 to step into the right relationships.

1045
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,860
 And God's not just gonna wash over that,

1046
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,180
 he's gonna deal with that hurt.

1047
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,020
 And so if you will, I'm gonna ask you to close your eyes

1048
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,140
 and just open your hands as a sign,

1049
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,860
 as a posture of receiving this prayer, not from me,

1050
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:37,400
 but through what only God can do.

1051
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,980
 Jesus, we come before you this morning,

1052
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,780
 and first of all, we say thank you for your love.

1053
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,260
 We thank you for the love that you give us

1054
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,300
 that even equips us and allows us to love others.

1055
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,300
 We thank you for this cloud of witnesses

1056
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,900
 that we have with us in this room.

1057
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,500
 We thank you for relationship

1058
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,940
 and how you've designed things to be a certain way.

1059
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,220
 Father, we recognize, we understand, and we see it.

1060
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,260
 And we ask first, God, for those of us

1061
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,860
 who are looking for spiritual friendship,

1062
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,980
 sacrificial friendship, friends who actually love,

1063
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,500
 relationships that actually model a love for you.

1064
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,500
 Holy Spirit, would you begin to show us where to look?

1065
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,480
 God, would you give us the right metric?

1066
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,300
 Would you help us not just look at the things

1067
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,920
 that we see with our eyes,

1068
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,060
 but help us to evaluate correctly?

1069
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:31,220
 Help us to find people who are gonna put you first,

1070
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,820
 who are gonna love you, and whose relationship with us

1071
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:37,700
 will push us into greater love and obedience to you,

1072
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,900
 people who will help us be more disciples of Christ.

1073
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,460
 God, we ask for those people.

1074
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:49,420
 God, for those of us who carry scars and burdens

1075
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,660
 and frustrations of past relationships

1076
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,580
 with the wrong people, moments where we've been hurt,

1077
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,060
 moments where we've not been heard,

1078
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,900
 taken advantage of, forgotten, neglected,

1079
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,900
 whatever the word is, God, you see what happens.

1080
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,620
 You see the scars we carry,

1081
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,140
 and your heart breaks for us,

1082
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,580
 but you also don't stop there

1083
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,300
 because you're a God of healing,

1084
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,760
 you're a God that restores.

1085
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,620
 So Holy Spirit, would you restore our hearts,

1086
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,460
 restore the parts that are broken,

1087
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,500
 and make whole again what is needed?

1088
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,300
 Would you give us the boldness, supernaturally,

1089
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,300
 to be able to step into the right relationships?

1090
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,580
 Would you allow us to be able to invest

1091
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,460
 into the right relationships?

1092
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,360
 Holy Spirit, would you transform us,

1093
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,100
 continue to transform us,

1094
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,500
 not just to receive the right people,

1095
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,220
 but God, may the vine be full of people

1096
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,380
 who are the right people for others.

1097
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,560
 Holy Spirit, do your work in us.

1098
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,340
 As we step into this year of action,

1099
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,100
 may we go with the right start,

1100
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,180
 may we make the right choices,

1101
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,540
 may we wear the right clothes,

1102
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,320
 and Holy Spirit, would we go with the right people?

1103
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,740
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
